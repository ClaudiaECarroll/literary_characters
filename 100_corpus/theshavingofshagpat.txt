THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
THE THWACKINGS.
It was ordained that Shibli Bagarag, nephew to the
renowned Baba Mustapha, chief barber to the Court of
Persia, should shave Shagpat, the son of Shimpoor, the son
of Shoolpi, the son of Shullum; and they had been clothiers
for generations, even to the time of Shagpat, illustrious.
Now the story of Shibli Bagarag, and of the ball he
followed, and of the subterranean kingdom he came to, and
of the enchanted palace he entered, and of the sleeping king
he shaved, and of the two princesses he released, and of the
Afrite held in subjection by the arts of one and bottled by
her, is it not known as 't were written on the finger-nails of
men and traced in their corner-robes ? As the poet says :
Ripe with oft telling and old is the tale,
But 't is of the sort that can never grow stale.
Now things were in that condition with Shibli Bagarag,
that on a certain day he was hungry and abject, and the city
of Shagpat the clothier was before him; so he made toward
it, deliberating as to how he should procure a meal, for he
had not a dirhem in his girdle, and the remembrance of
great dishes and savoury ingredients were to him as the
illusion of rivers sheening on the sands to travellers gasping
with thirst.


## p. 2 (#16) ###############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And he considered his case, crying, “Surely this comes
of wandering, and 't is the curse of the inquiring spirit! for
in Shiraz, where my craft is in favour, I should be sitting
now with my uncle, Baba Mustapha, the loquacious one,
cross-legged, partaking of seasoned sweet dishes, dipping my
fingers in them, rejoicing my soul with scandal of the
Court !"
Now he came to a knoll of sand under a palm, from which
the yellow domes and mosques of the city of Shagpat, and its
black cypresses, and marble palace fronts, and shining pillars,
and lofty carven arches that spanned half-circles of the hot
grey sky, were plainly visible. Then gazed he awhile despond-
ingly on the city of Shagpat, and groaned in contemplation
of his evil plight, as is said by the poet:
The curse of sorrow is comparison !
As the sun casteth shade, night showeth star,
We, measuring what we were by what we are,
Behold the depth to which we are undone.
Wherefore he counselleth :
Look neither too much up, nor down at all,
But, forward stepping, strive no more to fall.
And the advice is excellent; but, as is again said :
The preacher preacheth, and the hearer heareth,
But comfort first each function requireth.
And 'wisdom to a hungry stomach is thin pottage,' saith the
shrewd reader of men. Little comfort was there with Shibli
Bagarag, as he looked on the city of Shagpat the clothier!
He cried aloud that his evil chance had got the better of him,
and rolled his body in the sand, beating his breast, and con-
juring up images of the profusion of dainties and the abund-
ance of provision in Shiraz, exclaiming, “Well-a-way and

THE TIWACKINGS.
woe's me! this it is to be selected for the diversion of him
that plotteth against man.” Truly is it written:
On different heads misfortunes come :
One bears them firm, another faints,
While this one hangs them like a drum
Whereon to batter loud complaints.
And of the three kinds, they who bang the drum outnumber
the silent ones as do the billows of the sea the ships that
swim, or the grains of sand the trees that grow; a noisy
multitude.
Now he was in the pits of despondency, even as one that
yieldeth without further struggle to the waves of tempest at
midnight, when he was ware of one standing over him,-a
woman, old, wrinkled, a very crone, with but room for the
drawing of a thread between her nose and her chin; she
was, as is cited of them who betray the doings of Time,
Wrinkled at the rind, and overripe at the core,
and every part of her nodded and shook like a tree sapped
by the waters, and her joints were sharp as the hind-legs of
a grasshopper; she was indeed one close-wrecked upon the
rocks of Time.
Now, when the old woman had scanned Shibli Bagarag,
she called to him, “O thou ! what is it with thee, that thou
rollest as one reft of his wits ?"
He answered her, “I bewail my condition, which is
beggary, and the lack of that which filleth with pleasant-
ness."
So the old woman said, “Tell me thy case."
He answered her, "O old woman, surely it was written at
my birth that I should take ruin from the readers of planets.
Now, they proclaimed that I was one day destined for great
things, if I stood by my tackle, I, a barber. Know then,
that I have had many offers and bribes, seductive ones, from

the rich and the exalted in rank; and I heeded them not,
mindful of what was foretold of me. I stood by my tackle
as a warrior standeth by his arms, flourishing them. Now,
when I found great things came not to me, and 't was the
continuance of sameness and satiety with Baba Mustapha,
my uncle, in Shiraz,—the tongue-wagger, the endless tattler,
-surely I was advised by the words of the poet to go forth
in search of what was wanting, and he says:
"Thou that dreamest an Event,
While Circumstance is but a waste of sand,
Arise, take up thy fortunes in thy hand,
And daily forward pitch thy tent.'
Now, I passed from city to city, proclaiming my science,
holding aloft my tackle. Wullahy! many adventures were
mine, and if there's some day propitiousness in fortune, O
old woman, I'll tell thee of what befell me in the kingdom
of Shah Shamshureen : 't is wondrous, a matter to draw
down the lower jaw with amazement! Now so it was, that
in the eyes of one city I was honoured and in request, by
reason of my calling, and I fared sumptuously, even as a
great officer of state surrounded by slaves, lounging upon
clouds of silk stuffs, circled by attentive ears : in another
city there was no beast so base as I. Wah! I was one
hunted of men and an abomination; no housing for me,
nought to operate upon. I was the lean dog that lieth in
wait for offal. It seemeth certain, o old woman, that a
curse hath fallen on barbercraft in these days, because of the
Identical, whose might I know not. Everywhere it is
growing in disrepute ; 't is languishing! Nevertheless till
now I have preserved my tackle, and I would descend on
yonder city to exercise it, even for a livelihood, forgetting
awhile great things, but that I dread men may have changed
there also,—and there's no stability in them, I call Allah
(whose name be praised !) to witness ; so should I be a thing

unsightly, subject to hateful castigation; wherefore is it
that I am in that state described by the poet, when,
Dreading retreat, dreading advance to make,
Round we revolve like to the wounded snake.'
Is not my case now a piteous one, one that toucheth the
tender corner in man and woman ?”
When she that listened had heard him to an end, she
shook her garments, crying, “O youth, son of my uncle, be
comforted ! for, if it is as I think, the readers of planets
were right, and thou art thus early within reach of great
things-nigh grasping them."
Then she fell to mumbling and reciting jigs of verse,
quaint measures ; and she pored along the sand to where
a line had been drawn, and saw that the footprints of the
youth were traced along it. Lo, at that sight she clapped
her hands joyfully, and ran up to the youth, and peered in
his face, exclaiming, “Great things indeed! and praise thou
the readers of planets, O nephew of the barber,—they that
sent thee searching the Event thou art to master. Wullahy!
have I not half a mind to call thee already Master of the
Event ?"
Then she abated somewhat in her liveliness, and said to
him, “Know that the city thou seest is the city of Shagpat
the clothier, and there's no one living on the face of
earth, nor a soul that requireth thy craft more than he.
Go therefore thou, bold of heart, brisk, full of the sprightli-
ness of the barber, and enter to him. Lo, thou 'lt see him
lolling in his shop-front to be admired of this people-mar-
velled at. Oh ! no mistaking of Shagpat, and the mole might
discern Shagpat among myriads of our kind ; and enter thou
to him gaily, as to perform a friendly office, one meriting
thanks and gratulations, saying, 'I will preserve thee the
Identical !' Now he 'll at first feign not to understand
thee, dense of wit that he is ! but mince not matters with him,

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
perform well thy operation, and thou wilt come to great
things. What say I ? 't is certain that when thou hast shaved
Shagpat thou wilt have achieved the greatest of things, and
be most noteworthy of thy race,-thou, Shibli Bagarag, even
thou ! and thou wilt be Master of the Event, so named in
anecdotes and histories and records, to all succeeding genera-
tions."
At her words the breast of Shibli Bagarag took in a great
wind, and he hung his head a moment to ponder them; and
he thought, “There 's provokingness in the speech of this
old woman, and she's one that instigateth keenly. She called
me by my name! Heard I that? 'Tis a mystery !” And he
thought, “Peradventure she is a Genie, one of an ill tribe,
and she's luring me to my perdition in this city! How, if
that be so ?” And again he thought, “It cannot be ! She's
probably the genie that presided over my birth, and promised
me dower of great things through the mouths of the readers
of planets."
Now, when Shibli Bagarag had so deliberated, he lifted
his sight, and lo, the old woman was no longer before him !
He stared, and rubbed his eyes, but she was clean gone.
Then ran he to the knolls and eminences that were scattered
about, to command a view, but she was nowhere visible.
So he thought, “'T was a dream !” and he was composing
himself to despair upon the scant herbage of one of those
knolls, when as he chanced to gaze down the city below, he
saw there a commotion and a crowd of people flocking one
way; he thought, “'T was surely no dream ? come not Genii,
and go they not, in the fashion of that old woman? I'll
even descend on yonder city, and try my tackle on Shagpat,
inquiring for him, and if he is there, I shall know I have
had to do with a potent spirit. Allah protect me!"
So, having shut together the clasps of resolve, he arose
and made for the gates of the city, and entered it by the
principal entrance. It was a fair city, the fairest and chief
of that country; prosperous, powerful ; a mart for numerous

THE THWACKINGS.
commodities, handicrafts, wares; round it a wild country and
a waste of sand, ruled by the lion in his wrath, and in it the
tiger, the camelopard, the antelope, and other animals. Hither,
in caravans, came the people of Oolb and the people of
Damascus, and the people of Vatz, and they of Bagdad, and
the Ringheez, great traders, and others, trading; and there
was constant flow of intercourse between them and the city
of Shagpat. Now as Shibli Bagarag paced up one of the
streets of the city, he beheld a multitude in procession
following one that was crowned after the manner of kings,
with a glittering crown, clad in the yellow girdled robes,
and he sporting a fine profusion of hair, unequalled by all
around him, save by one that was a little behind, shadowed
by his presence. So Shibli Bagarag thought, “Is one of this
twain Shagpat? for never till now have I seen such rare
growths, and 't were indeed a bliss to slip the blade between
them and those masses of darkness that hang from them.”
Then he stepped before the King, and made himself pro-
minent in his path, humbling himself; and it was as he
anticipated that the King prevented his removal by the
slaves that would have dragged him away, and desired a
hearing as to his business, and what brought him to the city,
a stranger.
Thereupon Shibli Bagarag prostrated himself and cried,
“O great King, Sovereign of the Time ! surely I am one to
be looked on with the eye of grace; and I am nephew to
Baba Mustapha, renowned in Shiraz, a barber;-I a barber,
and it is my prayer, 0 King of the Age, that thou take me
under thy protection and the shield of thy fair will, while
I perform good work in this city by operating on the un-
shorn."
When he had spoken, the King made a point of his eye-
brows, and exclaimed, “Shiraz? So they hold out against
Shagpat yet, aha ? Shiraz! that nest of them ! that reptiles'
nest!” Then he turned to his Vizier beside him, and said,
“What shall be done with this fellow ?"


## p. 8 (#22) ###############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So, the Vizier replied, “'T were well, O King, he be sum-
moned to a sense of the loathsomeness of his craft by the
agency of fifty stripes.”
The King said, “ 'T is commanded !”
Then he passed forward very majestically, and Shibli
Bagarag was ware of the power of five slaves upon him, and
he was hurried at a quick pace through the streets and before
the eyes of the people, even to the common receptacle of
felons, and there received from each slave severally ten
thwacks with a thong: 't is certain that at every thwack the
thong took an airing before it descended upon him. Then
loosed they him, to wander whither he listed ; and disgust
was strong in him by reason of the disgrace of the blows,
and the severity of the administration of the blows. He
strayed along the streets in wretchedness, and hunger in-
creased on him, assailing him first as a wolf in his vitals,
then as it had been a chasm yawning betwixt his trunk and
his lower members. And he thought, “I have been long in
chase of great things, and the hope of attaining them is
great; yet, wullahy! would I barter all for one refreshing
meal, and the sense of fulness. 'T is so, and sad is it !”
And he was mindful of the poet's words,
Who seeks the shadow to the substance sinneth,
And daily craving what is not, he thinneth:
His lean ambition how shall he attain ?
For with this constant foolishness he doeth,-
He, waxing liker to what he pursueth,
Himself becometh what he chased in vain !
And again :
Of honour half my fellows boast, -
A thing that scorns and kills 18 :
Methinks that honours us the most
Which nourishes and fills us.
So, he thought he would of a surety fling far away his tackle,
discard barbercraft, and be as other men, a mere mortal,

forgotten with his generation. And he cried aloud, “O thou
old woman ! thou deceiver! what hast thou obtained for me
by thy deceits ļ and why put I faith in thee to the purchase
of a thwacking? Woe's me! I would thou hadst been but
a dream, thou crone ! thou guileful parcel of belabouring
bones!”
· Now, while he lounged and strolled, and was abusing the
old woman, he looked before him, and lo, one lolling in his
shop-front, and people standing outside the shop, marking
him with admiration and reverence, and pointing him out to
each other with approving gestures. He who lolled there
was indeed a miracle of hairiness, black with hair as he had
been muzzled with it, and his head as it were a berry in a
huge bush by reason of it. Then thought Shibli Bagarag,
“'T is Shagpat! If the mole could swear to him, surely can
I.” So he regarded the clothier, and there was naught seen
on earth like the gravity of Shagpat as he lolled before those
people that failed not to assemble in groups and gaze at him.
He was as a sleepy lion, cased in his mane; as an owl drowsy
in the daylight of applause. Now would he close an eye, or
move two fingers, but of other motion made he none, yet the
people gazed at him with eagerness. Shibli Bagarag was
astonished at them, thinking, “Hair! hair! There is might
in hair; but there is greater might in the barber! Never-
theless here the barber is scorned, the grower of crops held
in amazing reverence.” Then thought he, “T is truly
wondrous the crop he groweth ; not even King Shamshureen,
after a thousand years, sported such mighty profusion! Him
I sheared : it was a high task !—why not this Shagpat?”
Now, long gazing on Shagpat awoke in Shibli Bagarag
fierce desire to shear him, and it was scarce in his power to
restrain himself from flying at the clothier, he saying,
“What obstacle now? what protecteth him ? Nay, why not
trust to the old woman? Said she not I should first essay
on Shagpat? and 't was my folly in appealing to the King
that brought on me that thwacking. 'T is well ! I'll trust

to her words. Wullahy! will it not lead me to great
things ?”
So it was that as he thought this he continued to keep
eye on Shagpat, and the hunger that was in him passed, and
became a ravenous vulture that flew from him and singled
forth Shagpat as prey; and there was no help for it but in he
must go and state his case to Shagpat, and essay shearing him.
Now, when he was in the presence, he exclaimed, “ Peace,
O vendor of apparel, unto thee and unto thine!”
Shagpat answered, “That with thee !”
Said Shibli Bagarag, “I have heard of thee, O thou
wonder! Wullahy! I am here to render homage to that I
behold."
Shagpat answered, “'T is well ! ”
Then said Shibli Bagarag, “Praise my discretion! I have
even this day entered the city, and it is to thee I offer the
first shave, O tangle of glory !”
At these words Shagpat darkened, saying gruffly, “Thy
jest is offensive, and it is unseasonable for staleness and lack
of holiness.”
But Shibli Bagarag cried, “No jest, 0 purveyor to the
outward of us! but a very excellent earnest.”
Thereat the face of Shagpat was as an exceeding red berry
in a bush, and he said angrily, “Have done! no more of it !
or haply my spleen will be awakened, and that of them who
see with more eyes than two."
Nevertheless Shibli Bagarag urged him, and he winked,
and gesticulated, and pointed to his head, crying, “Fall not,
O man of the nicety of measure, into the trap of error; for
it is I that am a barber, and a rarity in this city, even
Shibli Bagarag of Shiraz! Know me, nephew of the re-
nowned Baba Mustapha, chief barber to the Court of Persia.
Languishest thou not for my art? Lo ! with three sweeps.
I'll give thee a clean poll, all save the Identical ! and I can
discern and save it; fear me not, nor distrust my skill and
the cunning that is mine."

THE TIWACKINGS.

When he had heard Shibli Bagarag to a close, the counte-
nance of Shagpat waxed fiery, as it had been flame kindled by
travellers at night in a thorny bramble-bush, and he ruffled,
and heaved, and was as when dense jungle-growths are
stirred violently by the near approach of a wild animal in his
fury, shouting in short breaths, “A barber! a barber! Is 't
so ? can it be? To me? A barber! O thou, thou reptile !
filthy thing! A barber! ( dog! A barber? What ļ when
I bid fair for the highest honours known? O sacrilegious
wretch ! monster! How ? are the Afrites jealous, that they
send thee to jibe me?”.
Thereupon he set up a cry for his wife, and that woman
rushed to him from an inner room, and fell upon Shibli
Bagarag, belabouring him.
So, when she was weary of this, she said, “ O light of my
eyes! O golden crop and adorable man! what hath he
done to thee?”
Shagpat answered solemnly, “'T is a barber ! and he hath
sworn to shave me, and leave me not save shorn !”
Hardly had Shagpat spoken this, when she swooned with
horror, and became limp with the hearing of it. Then Shibli
Bagarag slunk from the shop; but without the crowd had
increased, seeing an altercation, and as he took to his heels
they followed him, and there was terrific uproar in the streets
of the city and in the air above them as of raging Genii,-he
like a started quarry doubling this way and that, and at the
corners of streets and open places, speeding on till there was
no breath in his body, the cry still after him that he had
bearded Shagpat. At last they came up with him, and
belaboured him each and all ; it was a storm of thwacks
that fell on the back of Shibli Bagarag, from hands visible
and unseen. When they had wearied themselves in this
fashion, they took him as he had been a stray bundle or a.
damaged bale, and hurled him from the gates of the city
into the wilderness once more.
Now, when he was alone, he staggered awhile and then

flung himself to the earth, looking neither to the right nor
to the left, nor above. All he could think was, “O accursed
old woman!” and this he kept repeating to himself for
solace; as the poet says :
'T is sure the special privilege of hate,
To curse the authors of our evil state.
As he was thus complaining, behold the very old woman
before him! And she wheezed, and croaked, and coughed,
and shook herself, and screwed her face into a pleasing
pucker, and assumed womanish airs, and swayed herself like
as do the full moons of the harem when the eye of the
master is upon them. Having made an end of these pretti-
nesses, she said, in a tone of soft insinuation, “O youth,
nephew of the barber, look upon me.”
Shibli Bagarag knew her voice, and he would not look,
thinking, “Oh, what a dreadful old woman is this ! just
calling on her name in detestation maketh her present to
us." So the old woman, seeing him resolute to shun her,
leaned to him, and put one hand to her dress, and squatted
beside him, and said, “O youth, thou hast been thwacked !"
He groaned, lifting not his face, nor saying aught. Then
said she, “ Art thou truly in search of great things, O youth ?”
Still he groaned, answering no syllable. And she con-
tinued, “ 'T is surely in sweet friendliness I ask. Art thou
not a fair youth, one to entice a damsel to perfect friend-
liness ?"
Louder yet did he groan at her words, thinking, “A
damsel, verily !” So the old woman said, “I wot thou art
angry with me; but now look up, O nephew of the barber!
no time for vexation. What says the poet 1—
Cares the warrior for his wounds
When the steed in battle bounds ?'
Moreover:
• Let him who grasps the crown strip not for shame,
Lest he expose what gain'd it-blow and maim!'

THE THWACKINGS.

So be it with thee and thy thwacking, O foolish youth !
Hide it from thyself, thou silly one! What! thou hast
been thwacked, and refusest the fruit of it—which is
resoluteness, strength of mind, sternness in pursuit of the
object !”
Then she softened her tone to persuasiveness, saying,
“'T was written I should be the head of thy fortune, 0
Shibli Bagarag! and thou 'lt be enviable among men by my
aid, so look upon me, and (for I know thee famished) thou
shalt presently be supplied with viands and bright wines
and sweetmeats, delicacies to cheer thee."
Now, the promise of food and provision was powerful with
Shibli Bagarag, and he looked up gloomily. And the old
woman smiled archly at him, and wriggled in her seat like a
dusty worm, and said, “Dost thou find me charming, thou
fair youth ? "
He was nigh laughing in her face, but restrained himself
to reply, “ Thou art that thou art !”
Said she, “Not so, but that I shall be.” Then she said,
“O youth, pay me now a compliment !”
Shibli Bagarag was at a loss what further to say to the old
woman, for his heart cursed her for her persecutions, and
ridiculed her for her vanities. At last he bethought himself
of the saying of the poet, truly the offspring of fine wit,
where he says :
Expect no flatteries from me,
While I am empty of good things;
I'll call thee fair, and I'll agree
Thou holdest Love in silken strings,
When thou hast primed me from thy plenteous store!
But, oh! till then a clod am I:
No seed within to throw up flowers :
All's drouthy to the fountain dry :
To empty stomachs Nature lowers ;
The lake was full where Heaven look'd fair of yore!
So, when he had spoken that, the old woman laughed

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
and exclaimed, “Thou art apt! it is well said ! Surely I
excuse thee till that time! Now listen! 'T is written we
work together, and I know it by divination. Have I not
known thee wandering, and on thy way to this city of Shagpat,
where thou'lt some day sit throned ? Now I propose to thee,
this—and 't is an excellent proposition—that I lead thee to
great things, and make thee glorious, a sitter in high seats,
Master of an Event?”
Cried he, “A position honourable to thee, and pleasant
in the ear!”
She added, “ Provided thou marry me in sweet marriage."
Thereat he stared on vacancy with a serious eye, and he
could scarce credit her earnestness, but she repeated the same.
So presently he thought, “This old hag appeareth deep in
the fountain of events, and she will be a right arm to me in
the mastering of one, a torch in darkness, seeing there is
wisdom in her as well as wickedness. The thwackings ?—
sad was their taste, but they're in the road leading to greatness,
and I cannot say she put me out of that road in putting me
where they were. Her age?—shall I complain of that when
it is a sign she goeth shortly altogether ?”
As he was thus debating he regarded the old woman
stealthily, and she was in agitation, so that her joints creaked
like forest branches in a wind, and the puckers of her visage
moved as do billows of the sea to and fro, and the anticipations
of a fair young bride are not more eager than what was
visible in the old woman. Wheedlingly she looked at him,
and shaped her mouth like a bird's bill to soften it; and she
drew together her dress, to give herself the look of slimness,
using all fascinations. He thought, “T is a wondrous old
woman! Marriage would seem a thing of moment to her,
yet is the profit with me, and I'll agree to it.” So he said,
“T is a pact between us, O old woman!”
Now, the eyes of the old woman brightened when she
heard him, and were as the eyes of a falcon that eyeth game,
hungry with red fire, and she looked brisk with impatience,

laughing a low laugh and saying, “O youth, I must claim of
thee, as is usual in such cases, the kiss of contract."
So Shibli Bagarag was mindful of what is written,
If thou wouldst take the great leap, be ready for the little jump,
and he put his mouth to the forehead of the old woman.
When he had done so, it was as though she had been
illuminated, as when light is put in the hollow of a pumpkin.
Then said she, “This is well! this is a fair beginning! Now
look, for thy fortune will of a surety follow. Call me now
sweet bride, and knocker at the threshold of hearts !”
So, Shibli Bagarag sighed, and called her this, and he
said, “Forget not my condition, O old woman, and that I
am nigh famished.”
Upon that she nodded gravely, and arose and shook her
garments together, and beckoned for Shibli Bagarag to follow
her; and the two passed through the gates of the city, and
held on together through divers streets and thoroughfares
till they came before the doors of a palace with a pillared
entrance; and the old woman passed through the doors of
the palace as one familiar to them, and lo! they were in a
lofty court, built all of marble, and in the middle of it a
fountain playing, splashing with silver splashes. Shibli
Bagarag would have halted here to breathe the cool refresh-
ingness of the air, but the old woman would not; and she
hurried on even to the opening of a spacious hall, and in it
slaves in circle round a raised seat, where sat one that was
their lord, and it was the Chief Vizier of the King.
Then the old woman turned round sharply to Shibli
Bagarag, and said, “How of thy tackle, O my betrothed ?”
He answered, “The edge is keen, the hand ready."
Then said she, “'T is well.”
So, the old woman put her two hands on the shoulders of
Shibli Bagarag, saying, “ Make thy reverence to him on the
raised seat; have faith in thy tackle and in me. Renounce

not either, whatsoever ensueth. Be not abashed, O my
bridegroom to be !"
Thereupon she thrust him in; and Shibli Bagarag was
abashed, and played foolishly with his fingers, knowing not
what to do. So when the Chief Vizier saw him he cried
out, “ Who art thou, and what wantest thou ?”
Now, the back of Shibli Bagarag tingled when he heard
the Vizier's voice, and he said, “I am, O man of exalted
condition, he whom men know as Shibli Bagarag, nephew to
Baba Mustapha, the renowned of Shiraz; myself barber like-
wise, proud of my art, prepared to exercise it."
Then said the Chief Vizier, “This even to our faces !
Wonderful is the audacity of impudence! Know, O nephew
of the barber, thou art among them that honour not thy art.
Is it not written, For one thing thou shalt be crowned here,
for that thing be thwacked there ? So also it is written,
The tongue of the insolent one is a lash and a perpetual
castigation to him. And it is written, O Shibli Bagarag,
that I reap honour from thee, and there is no help but that
thou be made an example of.”
So, the Chief Vizier uttered command, and Shibli Bagarag
was ware of the power of five slaves upon him; and they
seized him familiarly, and placed him in position, and made
ready his clothing for the reception of fifty other thwacks
with a thong, each several thwack coming down on him with
a hiss as it were a serpent, and with a smack as it were the
mouth of satisfaction; and the people assembled extolled the
Chief Vizier, saying, “Well and valiantly done, O stay of
the State ! and such-like to the accursed race of barbers.”
Now, when they had passed before the Chief Vizier and
departed, lo! he fell to laughing violently, so that his hair
was agitated and was as a sand-cloud over him, and his
countenance behind it was as the sun of the desert reflected
ripplingly on the waters of a bubbling spring, for it had the
aspect of merriness; and the Chief Vizier exclaimed, “O
Shibli Bagarag, have I not made fair show?"


## p. 17 (#31) ##############################################

THE THWACKINGS.
17
And Shibli Bagarag said, “Excellent fair show, O mighty
one !" Yet knew he not in what, but he was abject by
reason of the thwacks.
So, the Vizier said, “Thou lookest lean, even as one to
whom Fortune oweth a long debt. Tell me now of thy
barbercraft : perchance thy gain will be great thereby?”
And he answered, “ My gain has been great, O eminent in
rank, but of evil quality, and I am content not to increase
it.” And he broke forth into lamentations, crying in
excellent verse :
Why am I thus the sport of all-
A thing Fate knocketh like a ball
From point to point of evil chance,
Even as the sneer of Circumstance ?
While thirsting for the highest fame,
I hunger like the lowest beast :
To be the first of men I aim
And find myself the least.
Now, the Vizier delayed not when he heard this to have
a fair supply set before Shibli Bagarag, and meats dressed in
divers fashions, spiced, and coloured, and with herbs, and
wines in golden goblets, and slaves in attendance. So Shibli
Bagarag ate and drank, and presently his soul arose from its
prostration, and he cried, “ Wullaby! the head cook of King
Shamshureen could have worked no better as regards the
restorative process.”
Then said the Chief Vizier, “O Shibli Bagarag, where
now is thy tackle ? "
And Shibli Bagarag winked and nodded and turned his
head in the manner of the knowing ones, and he recited the
verse :
'T is well that we are sometimes circumspect,
And hold ourselves in witless ways deterred :
ONE thwacking made me seriously reflect;
A SECOND turned the cream of love to curd :
Most surely that profession I reject
Before the fear of a prospective THIRD.

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So, the Vizier said, “T is well, thou turnest verse neatly.”
And he exclaimed extemporaneously :
If thou wouldst have thy achievement as high
As the wings of Ambition can fly :
If thou the clear summit of hope wouldst attain,
And not have thy labour in vain;
Be steadfast in that which impell’d, for the peace
Of earth he who leaves must have trust :
He is safe while he soars, but when faith shall cease,
Desponding he drops to the dust.
Then said he, “ Fear no further thwacking, but honour and
prosperity in the place of it. What says the poet ?-
• We faint, when for the fire
There needs one spark;
We droop, when our desire
Is near its mark.'
How near to it art thou, O Shibli Bagarag! Know,
then, that among this people there is great reverence for the
growing of hair, and he that is hairiest is honoured most,
wherefore are barbers creatures of especial abhorrence, and
of a surety flourish not. And so it is that I owe my station
to the esteem I profess for the cultivation of hair, and to my
persecution of the clippers of it. And in this kingdom is
no one that beareth such a crop as I, saving one, a clothier,
an accursed one !—and may a blight fall upon him for his
vanity and his affectation of solemn priestliness, and his
lolling in his shop-front to be admired and marvelled at by
this people. So this fellow I would disgrace and bring to
scorn,—this Shagpat ! for he is mine enemy, and the eye of
the King my master is on him. Now I conceive thy assist-
ance in this matter, O Shibli Bagarag,—thou, a barber.”
When Shibli Bagarag heard mention of Shagpat, and the
desire for vengeance in the Vizier, he was as a new man, and
he smelt the sweetness of his own revenge as a vulture
smelleth the carrion from afar, and he said, “I am thy

19
servant, thy slave, O Vizier !” Then smiled he as to his
own soul, and he exclaimed, “On my head be it !”
And it was to him as when sudden gusts of perfume from
garden roses of the valley meet the traveller's nostril on the
hill that overlooketh the valley, filling him with ecstasy and
newness of life,-delicate visions. And he cried, “ Wullahy!
this is fair ; this is well! I am he that was appointed to do
thy work, O man in office! What says the poet :
"The destined band doth strike the fated blow :
Surely the arrow's fitted to the bow!'.
And he says:
"The feathered seed for the wind delayeth,
The wind above the garden swayeth,
The garden of its burden knoweth,
The burden falleth, sinketh, soweth.'”
So, the Vizier chuckled and nodded, saying, “Right, right!
aptly spoken, O youth of favour ! 'T is even so, and there is
wisdom in what is written :
• Chance is a poor knave;
Its own sad slave ;
Two meet that were to meet :
Life's no cheat.'"
Upon that he cried, “ First let us have with us the Eclipser
of Reason, and take counsel with her, as is my custom.”
Now, the Vizier made signal to a slave in attendance, and
the slave departed from the hall, and the Vizier led Shibli
Bagarag into a closer chamber, which had a smooth floor of
inlaid silver and silken hangings, the windows looking forth
on the gardens of the palace and its fountains and cool re-
cesses of shade and temperate sweetness. While they sat
there conversing in this metre and that, measuring quotations,
lo ! the old woman, the affianced of Shibli Bagarag—and
she sumptuously arrayed, in perfect queenliness, her head
bound in a circlet of gems and gold, her figure lustrous with
c 2

a full robe of flowing crimson silk; and she wore slippers
embroidered with golden traceries, and round her waist a
girdle flashing with jewels, so that to look on she was as a
long falling water in the last bright slant of the sun. Her
hair hung disarranged, and spread in a scattered fashion off
her shoulders; and she was younger by many moons, her
brow smooth where Shibli Bagarag had given the kiss of
contract, her hand soft where he had taken it. Shibli
Bagarag was smitten with astonishment at sight of her, and
he thought, “Surely the aspect of this old woman would
realize the story of Bhanavar the Beautiful ; and it is a
story marvellous to think of; yet how great is the likeness
between Bhanavar and this old woman that groweth
younger !”
And he thought again, “What if the story of Bhanavar
be a true one; this old woman such as she-no other ?”
So, while he considered her the Vizier exclaimed, “Is she
not fair—my daughter ?”.
And the youth answered, “ She is, 0 Vizier, that
she is !"
But the Vizier cried, “Nay by Allah ! she is that she
will be." And the Vizier said, “T is she that is my
daughter ; tell me thy thought of her, as thou thinkest it.”
And Shibli Bagarag replied, “ O Vizier, my thought of
her is, she seemeth indeed Bhanavar the Beautiful-no
other.”
Then the Vizier and the Eclipser of Reason exclaimed to-
gether, “How of Bhanavar and her story, O youth? We
listen !”
So, Shibli Bagarag leaned slightly on a cushion of a
couch, and narrated as followeth.


## p. 21 (#35) ##############################################

AND THIS IS THE STORY OF BHANAVAR
THE BEAUTIFUL.
Know that at the foot of a lofty mountain of the Caucasus
there lieth a deep blue lake; near to this lake a nest of ser-
pents, wise and ancient. Now it was the habit of a damsel
to pass by the lake early at morn, on her way from the tents
of her tribe to the pastures of the flocks. As she pressed
the white arch of her feet on the soft green-mossed grasses
by the shore of the lake she would let loose her hair, look-
ing over into the water, and bind the braid again round her
temples and behind her ears, as it had been in a lucent
mirror: so doing she would laugh. Her laughter was like
the falls of water at moonrise ; her loveliness like the very
moonrise ; and she was stately as a palm-tree standing before
the moon.
This was Bhanavar the Beautiful.
Now, the damsel was betrothed to the son of a neighbour-
ing Emir, a youth comely, well-fashioned, skilled with the
bow, apt in all exercises ; one that sat his mare firm as the
trained falcon that fixeth on the plunging bull of the plains;
fair and terrible in combat as the lightning that strideth the
rolling storm; and it is sung by the poet :
When on his desert mare I see
My prince of men,
I think bim then
As high above humanity
As he shines radiant over me.


## p. 22 (#36) ##############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Lo! like a torrent he doth bound,
Breasting the shock
From rock to rock:
A pillar of storm, he shakes the ground,
His turban on his temples wound.
Match me for worth to be adored
A youth like him
In heart and limb!
Swift as his anger is his sword ;
Softer than woman his true word.
Now, the love of this youth for the damsel Bhanavar was
a consuming passion, and the father of the damsel and the
father of the youth looked fairly on the prospect of their
union, which was near, and was plighted as the union of the
two tribes. So they met, and there was no voice against
their meeting, and all the love that was in them they were
free to pour forth far from the hearing of men, even where
they would. Before the rising of the sun, and ere his
setting, the youth rode swiftly from the green tents of the
Emir his father, to waylay her by the waters of the lake;
and Bhanavar was there, bending over the lake, her image
in the lake glowing like the fair fulness of the moon; and
the youth leaned to her from his steed, and sang to her
verses of her great loveliness ere she was wistful of him.
Then she turned to him, and laughed lightly a welcome of
sweetness, and shook the falls of her hair across the blushes
of her face and her bosom; and he folded her to him, and
those two would fondle together in the fashion of the
betrothed ones (the blessing of Allah be on them all !),
gazing on each other till their eyes swam with tears, and
they were nigh swooning with the fulness of their bliss.
Surely it was an innocent and tender dalliance, and their
prattle was that of lovers till the time of parting, he showing
her how she looked best-she him; and they were forgetful
of all else that is, in their sweet interchange of flatteries; and
the world was a wilderness to them both when the youth

23
parted with Bhanavar by the brook which bounded the tents
of her tribe.
It was on a night when they were so together, the damsel
leaning on his arm, her eyes towards the lake, and lo! what
seemed the reflection of a large star in the water; and there
was darkness in the sky above it, thick clouds, and no sight
of the heavens; so she held her face to hin sideways and
said, “What meaneth this, O my betrothed ? for there is
reflected in yonder lake a light as of a star, and there is no
star visible this night.”
The youth trembled as one in trouble of spirit, and
exclaimed, “Look not on it, O my soul! It is of evil omen.”
But Bhanavar kept her gaze constantly on the light, and
the light increased in lustre; and the light became, from a
pale sad splendour, dazzling in its brilliancy. Listening,
they heard presently a gurgling noise as of one deeply
drinking. Then the youth sighed a heavy sigh and said,
“This is the Serpent of the Lake drinking of its waters, as
is her wont once every moon, and whoso heareth her drink
by the sheening of that light is under a destiny dark and
imminent; so know I my days are numbered, and it was
foretold of me, this !” Now the youth sought to dissuade
Bhanavar from gazing on the light, and he flung his whole
body before her eyes, and clasped her head upon his breast,
and clung about her, caressing her; yet she slipped from
him, and she cried, “Tell me of this serpent, and of this
light.”
So, he said, “ Seek not to hear of it, O my betrothed !"
Then she gazed at the light a moment more intently, and
tumed her fair shape toward him, and put up her long
white fingers to his chin, and smoothed him with their soft-
ness, whispering, “ Tell me of it, my life ! ”
And so it was that her winningness melted him, and he
said, “ O Bhanavar ! the serpent is the Serpent of the Lake;
old, wise, powerful; of the brood of the sacred mountain,
that lifteth by day a peak of gold, and by night a point of

solitary silver. In her head, upon her forehead, between
her eyes, there is a Jewel, and it is this light.”
Then she said, “How came the Jewel there, in such a
place ?”
He answered, “'T is the growth of one thousand years in
the head of the serpent.”
She cried, “Surely precious ?”
He answered, “Beyond price !”
As he spake the tears streamed from him, and he was
shaken with grief, but she noted nought of this, and watched
the wonder of the light, and its increasing, and quivering,
and lengthening; and the light was as an arrow of beams
and as a globe of radiance. Desire for the Jewel waxed in
her, and she had no sight but for it alone, crying, “T is a
Jewel exceeding in preciousness all jewels that are, and for
the possessing it would I forfeit all that is."
So, he said sorrowfully, “Our love, O Bhanavar? and our
hopes of espousal ?"
But she cried, “No question of that! Prove now thy
passion for me, 0 warrior ! and win for me that Jewel.”
Then he pleaded with her, and exclaimed, “Urge not
this! The winning of the Jewel is worth my life; and my
life, 0 Bhanavar—surely its breath is but the love of thee.”
So, she said, “Thou fearest a risk ?”
And he replied, “Little fear I; my life is thine to cast
away. This Jewel it is evil to have, and evil followeth the
soul that hath it.”
Upon that she cried, “A trick to cheat me of the Jewel !
thy love is wanting at the proof.”
And she taunted the youth her betrothed, and turned
from him, and hardened at his tenderness, and made her
sweet shape as a thorn to his caressing, and his heart was
charged with anguish for her. So at the last, when he had
wept a space in silence, he cried, “ Thou hast willed it; the
Jewel shall be thine, O my soul !"
Then said he, “Thou hast willed it, О Bhanavar ! and
she taunted the
at his tenderness, his heart was

my life is as a grain of sand weighed against thy wishes ;
Allah is my witness ! Meet me therefore here, O my
beloved, at the end of one quarter-moon, even beneath the
shadow of this palm-tree, by the lake, and at this hour, and
I will deliver into thy hands the Jewel. So farewell !
Wind me once about with thine arms, that I may take
comfort from thee."
When their kiss was over the youth led her silently to
the brook of their parting—the clear, cold, bubbling brook-
and passed from her sight; and the damsel was exulting,
and leapt and made circles in her glee, and she danced and
rioted and sang, and clapped her hands, crying, “If I am
now Bhanavar the Beautiful how shall I be when that Jewel
is upon me, the bright light which beameth in the darkness,
and needeth to light it no other light ? Surely there will be
envy among the maidens and the widows, and my name and
the odour of my beauty will travel to the courts of far
kings."
So was she jubilant; and her sisters that met her
marvelled at her and the deep glow that was upon her, even
as the glow of the Great Desert when the sun has fallen;
and they said among themselves, “She is covered all over
with the blush of one that is a bride, and the bridegroom's
kiss yet burneth upon Bhanavar !”
So, they undressed her and she lay among them, and was
all night even as a bursting rose in a vase filled with droop-
ing lilies; and one of the maidens that put her hand on the
left breast of Bhanavar felt it full, and the heart beneath it ·
panting and beating swifter than the ground is struck by
hooves of the chosen steed sent by the Chieftain to the city
of his people with news of victory and the summons for
rejoicing.
Now, the nights and the days of Bhanavar were even as
this night, and she was as an unquiet soul till the appointed
time for the meeting with her lover had come. Then when
the sun was lighting with his slant beam the green grass

slope by the blue brook before her, Bhanavar arrayed
herself and went forth gaily, as a martial queen to certain
conquest ; and of all the flowers that nodded to the setting,
-yea, the crimson, purple, pure white, streaked-yellow,
azure, and saffron, there was no flower fairer in its hues than
Bhanavar, nor bird of the heavens freer in its glittering
plumage, nor shape of loveliness such as hers. Truly, when
she had taken her place under the palm by the waters of the
lake, that was no exaggeration of the poet, where he says:
Snows of the mountain-peaks were mirror'd there
Beneath her feet, not whiter than they were ;
Not rosier in the white, that falling flush
Broad on the wave, than in her cheek the blush.
And again :
She draws the heavens down to her,
So rare she is, so fair she is;
They flutter with a crown to her,
And lighten only where she is.
And he exclaims, in verse that applieth to her:
Exquisite slenderness!
Sleek little antelope!
Serpent of sweetness!
Eagle that soaringly
Wins me adoringly!
Teach me thy fleetness,
Vision of loveliness ;
Turn to my tenderness !
Now, when the sun was lost to earth, and all was darkness,
Bhanavar fixed her eyes upon an opening arch of foliage
in the glade through which the youth her lover should come
to her, and clasped both hands across her bosom, so shaken
was she with eager longing and expectation. In her hunger
for his approach, she would at whiles pluck up the herbage
about her by the roots, and toss handfuls this way and that,
chiding the peaceful song of the nightbird in the leaves above

her head; and she was sinking with fretfulness, when lo!
from the opening arch of the glade a sudden light, and
Bhanavar knew it for the Jewel in the fingers of her betrothed,
by the strength of its effulgence. Then she called to him
joyfully a cry of welcome, and quickened his coming with
her calls, and the youth alighted from his mare and left it to
pasture, and advanced to her, holding aloft the Jewel. And
the Jewel was of great size and purity, round, and all-luminous,
throwing rays and beams everywhere about it, a miracle to
behold, the light in it shining, and as the very life of the
blood, a sweet crimson, a ruby, a softer rose, an amethyst of
tender hues : it was a full globe of splendours, showing like
a very kingdom of the Blest; and blessed was the eye
beholding it! So when he was within reach of her arm, the
damsel sprang to him and caught from his hand the Jewel,
and held it before her eyes, and danced with it, and pressed
it on her bosom, and was as a creature giddy with great joy
in possessing it. And she put the Jewel in her bosom, and
looked on the youth to thank him for the Jewel with
all her beauty; for the passion of a mighty pride in him who
had won for her the Jewel exalted Bhanavar, and she said
sweetly, “Now hast thou proved to me thy love of me, and
I am thine, O my betrothed,-wholly thine. Kiss me, then,
and cease not kissing me, for bliss is in me.”
But the youth eyed her sorrowfully, even as one that hath
great yearning, and no power to move or speak.
So, she said again, in the low melody of deep love-tones,
“Kiss me, O my lover! for I desire thy kiss.”
Still he spake not, and was as a pillar of stone.
And she started, and cried, “Thou art wholel withouta hurt ?"
Then sought she to coax him to her with all the softness of
her half-closed eyes and budded lips, saying, “'T was an
idle fear ! and I have thee, and thou art mine, and I am
thine; so speak to me my lover! for there is no music like
the music of thy voice, and the absence of it is the absence
of all sweetness, and there is no pleasure in life without it.”

THE SUAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So the tenderness of her fondling melted the silence in him,
and presently his tongue was loosed, and he breathed in pain
of spirit, and his words were the words of the proverb:
He that fighteth with poison is no match for the prick of a thorn.
And he said, “Surely, 0 Bhanavar, my love for thee
surpasseth what is told of others that have loved before us,
and I count no loss a loss that is for thy sake.” And he
sighed, and sang :
Sadder than is the moon's lost light,
Lost ere the kindling of dawn,
To travellers journeying on,
The shutting of thy fair face from my sight.
Might I look on thee in death,
With bliss I would yield my breath.
Oh! what warrior dies
With heaven in his eyes ?
O Bhanavar! too rich a prize!
The life of my nostrils art thon,
The balm-dew on my brow;
Thou art the perfume I meet as I speed o'er the plains,
The strength of my arms, the blood of my veins.
Then said he, “I make nothing matter of complaint, Allah
witnesseth ! not even the long parting from her I love.
What will be, will be : so was it written! 'T is but a
scratch, O my soul! yet am I of the dead and them that
are passed away'T is hard ; but I smile in the face of
bitterness."
Now, at his words the damsel clutched him with both her
hands, and the blood went from her, and she was as a block
of white marble, even as one of those we meet in the desert,
leaning together, marking the wrath of the All-powerful on
forgotten cities. And the tongue of the damsel was dry,
and she was without speech, gazing at him with wide-open
eyes, like one in trance. Then she started as a dreamer
wakeneth, and flung herself quickly on the breast of the

youth, and put up the sleeve from his arm, and beheld by
the beams of the quarter-crescent that had risen through the
leaves, a small bite on the arm of the youth her betrothed,
spotted with seven spots of blood in a crescent; so she knew
that the poison of the serpent had entered by that bite; and
she loosened herself to the violence of her anguish, shrieking
the shrieks of despair, so that the voice of her lamentation
was multiplied about and made many voices in the night.
Her spirit returned not to her till the crescent of the moon
was yellow to its fall; and lo! the youth was sighing heavy
sighs and leaning to the ground on one elbow, and she flung
herself by him on the ground, seeking for herbs that were
antidotes to the poison of the serpent, grovelling among the
grasses and strewn leaves of the wood, peering at them
tearfully by the pale beams, and startling the insects as she
moved. When she had gathered some, she pressed them and
'bruised them, and laid them along his lips, that were white
as the ball of an eye; and she made him drink drops of the
juices of the herbs, wailing and swaying her body across him,
as one that seeketh vainly to give brightness again to the
. flames of a dying fire. But now his time was drawing nigh,
and he was weak, and took her hand in his and gazed on her
face, sighing, and said, “There is nothing shall keep me by
thee now, () my betrothed, my beautiful! Weep not, for it
is the doing of fate, and not thy doing. So ere I go, and
the grave-cloth separates thy heart from my heart, listen to
me. Lo, that Jewel ! it is the giver of years and of powers,
and of loveliness beyond mortal, yet the wearing of it availeth
not in the pursuit of happiness. Now art thou Queen over
the serpents of this lake: it was the Queen-serpent I slew,
and her vengeance is on me here. Now art thou mighty, O
Bhanavar ! and look to do well by thy tribe, and that from
which I spring, recompensing my father for his loss, pouring
ointment on his affliction, for great is the grief of the old
man, and he loveth me, and is childless."
Then the youth fell back and was still; and Bhanavar put

her ear to his mouth, and heard what seemed an inner voice
murmuring in him, and it was of his infancy and his boy-
hood, and of his father the Emir's first gift to him, his horse
Zoora, in old times. Presently the youth revived somewhat,
and looked upon her ; but his sight was glazed with a film,
and she sang her name to him ere he knew her, and the sad
sweetness of her name filled his soul, and he replied to her
with it weakly, like a far echo that groweth fainter,
“Bhanavar! Bhanavar ! Bhanavar !” Then a change came
over him, and the pain of the poison and the passion of the
death-throe, and he was wistful of her no more ; but she lay
by him, embracing him, and in the last violence of his
anguish he hugged her to his breast. Then it was over, and
he sank. And the twain were as a great wave heaving upon
the shore ; lo, part is wasted where it falleth ; part draweth
back into the waters. So was it!
Now, the chill of dawn breathed blue on the lake and was
astir among the dewy leaves of the wood, when Bhanavar
arose from the body of the youth, and as she rose she saw
that his mare Zoora, his father's first gift, was snuffing at the
ear of her dead master, and pawing him. At that sight the
tears poured from her eyelids, and she sobbed out to the
mare, “O Zoora! never mare bore nobler burden on her
back than thou in Zurvan my betrothed. Zoora! thou
weepest, for death is first known to thee in the dearest thing
that was thine; as to me, in the dearest that was mine! Anil
O Zoora, steed of Zurvan my betrothed, there's no loveliness
for us in life, for the loveliest is gone; and let us die, Zoora,
mare of Zurvan my betrothed, for what is dying to us, O
Zoora, who cherish beyond all that which death has taken ?”
So spake she to Zoora the mare, kissing her, and running
her fingers through the long white mane of the mare. Then
she stooped to the body of her betrothed, and toiled with it
to lift it across the crimson saddle-cloth that was on the
back of Zoora ; and the mare knelt to her, that she might
lay on her back the body of Zurvan; when that was done,

Bhanavar paced beside Zoora the mare, weeping and caressing
her, reminding her of the deeds of Zurvan, and the battles
she had borne him to, and his greatness and his gentleness.
And the mare went without leading. It was broad light
when they had passed the glade and the covert of the wood.
Before them, between great mountains, glimmered a space of
rolling grass fed to deep greenness by many brooks. The
shadow of a mountain was over this space, and one slant of
the rising sun, down a glade of the mountain, touched the
green tent of the Emir, where it stood a little apart from the
others of his tribe. Goats and asses of the tribe were pastur-
ing in the quiet, but save them nothing moved among the
tents, and it was deep peacefulness. Bhanavar led Zoora
slowly before the tent of the Emir, and disburdened Zoora of
the helpless weight, and spread the long fair limbs of the
youth lengthwise across the threshold of the Emir's tent,
sitting away from it with clasped hands, regarding it. Ere
long the Emir came forth, and his foot was on the body of
his son, and he knew death on the chin and the eyes of
Zurvan, his sole son. Now the Emir was old, and with the
shock of that sight the world darkened before him, and he
gave forth a groan and stumbled over the sunken breast of
Zurvan, and stretched over him as one without life. When
Bhanavar saw that old man stretched over the body of his.
son, she sickened, and her ear was filled with the wailings of
grief that would arise, and she stood up and stole away from
the habitations of the tribe, stricken with her guilt, and
wandered beyond the mountains, knowing not whither she
went, looking on no living thing, for the sight of a thing
that moved was hateful to her, and all sounds were to her
sounds of lamentation for a great loss.
Now, she had wandered on alone two days and two nights,
and nigh morn she was seized with a swoon of weariness,
and fell forward with her face to the earth, and lay there
prostrate, even as one that is adoring the shrine ; and it was
on the sands of the desert she was lying. It chanced that

the Chieftain of a desert tribe passed at midday by the spot,
and secing the figure of a damsel unshaded by any shade of
tree or herb or tent-covering, and prostrate on the sands, he
reined his steed and leaned forward to her, and called to her.
Then as she answered nothing he dismounted, and thrust his
arm softly beneath her and lifted her gently ; and her swoon
had the whiteness of death, so that he thought her dead verily,
and the marvel of her great loveliness in death smote the
heart on his ribs as with a blow, and the powers of life went
from him a moment as he looked on her and the long dark
wet lashes that clung to her colourless face, as at night in
groves where the betrothed ones wander, the slender leaves
of the acacia spread darkly over the full moon. And he
cried, “'T is a loveliness that maketh the soul yearn to the
cold bosom of death, so lovely, exceeding all that liveth, is
she !”
After he had contemplated her longwhile, he snatched his
sight from her, and swung her swiftly on the back of his
mare, and leaned her on one arm, and sped westward over
the sands of the desert, halting not till he was in the hum
of many tents, and the sun of that day hung a red half-circle
across the sand. He alighted before the tent of his mother,
and sent women in to her. When his mother came forth to
the greeting of her son, he said no word, but pointed to the
damsel where he had leaned her at the threshold of her tent.
His mother kissed him on the forehead, and turned her
shoulder to peer upon the damsel. But when she had close
view of Bhanavar, she spat, and scattered her hair, and
stamped, and cried aloud, “ Away with her! this slut of
darkness ! there's poison on her very skirts, and evil in the
look of her.”
Then said he, “O Rukrooth, my mother ! art thou lost
to charity and the uses of kindliness and the laws of
hospitality, that thou talkest this of the damsel, a stranger ?
Take her now in, and if she be past help, as I fear, be it thy
care to give her decent burial; and if she live, O my

THE STORY OF BHANAVAR.
33
mother, tend her for the love of thy son, and for the love of
him be gentle with her.”
While he spake, Rukrooth his mother knelt over the
damsel, as a cat that sniffeth the suspected dish ; and she
flashed her eyes back on him, exclaiming scornfully, “ So
art thou befooled, and the poison is already in thee? But
I will not have her, O my son ! and thou, Ruark, my son,
neither shalt thou have her. What! will I not die to save
thee from a harm? Surely thy frown is little to me, my
son, if I save thee from a harm; and the damsel here is-I
shudder to think what; but never lay shadow across my
threshold dark as this !”
Now, Ruark gazed upon his mother, and upon Bhanavar,
and the face of Bhanavar was as a babe in sleep, and his
soul melted to the parted sweetness of her soft little curved
red lips and her closed eyelids, and her innocent open hands,
where she lay at the threshold of the tent, unconscious of
hardness and the sayings of the unjust. So he cried
fiercely, “No paltering, O Rukrooth, my mother : and if not
to thy tent, then to mine!”
When she heard him say that in the voice of his anger,
Rukrooth fixed her eyes on him sorrowfully, and sighed,
and went up to him and drew his head once against her
heart, and retreated into the tent, bidding the women that
were there bring in the body of the damsel.
It was the morning of another day when Bhanavar
awoke; and she awoke in a dream of Zoora, the mare of
Zurvan her betrothed, that was dead, and the name of Zoora
was on her tongue as she started up. She was on a couch
of silk and leopard-skins; at her feet a fair young girl with
a fan of pheasant feathers. She stared at the hangings of
the tent, which were richer than those of her own tribe; the
cloths, and the cushions, and the embroideries ; and the
strangeness of all was pain to her, she knew not why.
Then wept she bitterly, and with her tears the memory of
what had been came back to her, and she opened her arms

to take into them the little girl that fanned her, that she
might love something and be beloved awhile; and the child
sobbed with her. After a time Bhanavar said, “ Where
am I, and amongst whom, my child, my sister ? ”
And the child answered her, “ Surely in the tent of the
mother of Ruark, the chief, even chief of the Beni-Asser,
and he found thee in the desert, nigh dead. 'T is so; and
this morning will Ruark be gone to meet the challenge of
Ebn Asrac, and they will fight at the foot of the Snow
Mountains, and the shadow of yonder date-palm will be over
our tent here at the hour they fight, and I shall sing for
Ruark, and kneel here in the darkness of the shadow.”
While the child was speaking there entered to them a tall
aged woman, with one swathe of a turban across her long
level brows; and she had hard black eyes, and close lips and
a square chin; and it was the mother of Ruark. She strode
forward toward Bhanavar to greet her, and folded her legs
before the damsel. Presently she said, “Tell me thy story,
and of thy coming into the hands of Ruark my son."
Bhanavar shuddered, and was silent. So Rukrooth dis-
missed the little maiden from the chamber of the tent, and
laid her left hand on one arm of Bhanavar, and said, “I
would know whence comest thou, that we may deal well by
thee and thy people that have lost thee.”
The touch of a hand was as the touch of a corpse to
Bhanavar, and the damsel was constrained to speak by a power
she knew not of, and she told all to Rukrooth of what had
been, the great misery, and the wickedness that was hers.
Then Ruark's mother took hold of Bhanavar a strong grasp,
and eyed her long, piteously, and with reproach, and rocked
forward and back, and kept rocking to and fro, crying
at intervals, “O Ruark! my son! my son! this feared
I, and thou art not the first ! and I saw it, I saw it! Well-
away ! why came she in thy way, -why, Ruark, my son, my
fire-eye? Canst thou be saved by me, fated that thou art,
thou fair-face ? And wilt thou be saved by me, my son, ere

thy story be told in tears as this one, that is as thine to me?
And thou wilt seize a jewel, Ruark, O thou soul of wrath,
my son, my dazzling Chief, and seize it to wear it, and think
it bliss, this lovely jewel; but 't is an anguish endless and
for ever, my son! Woe's me! an anguish is she without
end."
Rukrooth continued moaning, and the thought that was in
the mother of Ruark struck Bhanavar like a light in the
land of despair that darkly illumineth the dreaded gulfs and
abysses of the land, and she knew herself black in evil;
and the scourge of her guilt was upon her, and she cursed
herself before Rukrooth, and fawned before her, abasing her
body. So Rukrooth was drawn to the damsel by the
violence of her self-accusing and her abandonment to grief,
and lifted her, and comforted her, and after awhile they had
gentle speech together, and the two women opened their
hearts and wept. Then it was agreed between them that
Bhanavar should depart from the encampment of the tribe be-
fore the return of Ruark, and seek shelter among her own
people again, and aid them and the tribe of Zurvan, her be-
trothed, by the might of the Jewel which was hers, fulfilling
the desire of Zurvan. The mind of the damsel was lowly,
and her soul yearned for the blessing of Rukrooth.
Darkness hung over the tent from the shadow of the date-
palm when Bhanavar departed, and the blessing of Rukrooth
was on her head. She went forth fairly mounted on a fresh
steed; beside her two warriors of them that were left to
guard the encampment of the tribe of Ruark in his absence;
and Rukrooth watched at the threshold of her tent for the
coming of Ruark.
When it was middle night, and the splendour of the moon
was beaming on the edge of the desert, Bhanavar alighted
to rest by the twigs of a tamarisk that stood singly on the
sands. The two warriors tied the fetlocks of their steeds,
and spread shawls for her, and watched over her while she
slept. And the damsel dreamed, and the roaring of the lion
D 2

was boarse in her dream, and it was to her as were she the
red whirlwind of the desert before whom all bowed in terror,
the Arab, the wild horsemen, and the caravans of pilgrimage ;
and none could stay her, neither could she stay herself, for
the curse of Allah was on men by reason of her guilt; and
she went swinging great folds of darkness across kingdoms
and empires of earth where joy was and peace of spirit; and
in her track amazement and calamity, and the whitened
bones of noble youths, valorous chieftains. In that horror
of her dream she stood up suddenly, and thrust forth her
hands as to avert an evil, and advanced a step ; and with
the act her dream was cloven and she awoke, and lo! it was
sunrise ; and where had been two warriors of the Beni-Asser,
were now five, and besides her own steed five others, one the
steed of Ruark, and Ruark with them that watched over her:
pale was the visage of the Chief. Ruark eyed Bhanavar,
and signalled to his followers, and they, when they had
lifted the damsel to her steed and placed her in their front,
mounted likewise, and flourished their lances with cries, and
jerked their heels to the flanks of their steeds, and stretched
forward till their beards were mixed with the tossing manes,
and the dust rose after them crimson in the sun. So they
coursed away, speeding behind their Chief and Bhanavar;
sweet were the desert herbs under their crushing hooves !
Ere the shadow of the acacia measured less than its height
they came upon a spring of silver water, and Ruark leaped
from his steed, and Bhanavar from hers, and they performed
their ablutions by that spring, and ate and drank, and
watered their steeds. While they were there Bhanavar
lifted her eyes to Ruark, and said, “Whither takest thou me,
O my Chief ?"
His brow was stern, and he answered, “Surely to the
dwelling of thy tribe."
Then she wept, and pulled her veil close, murmuring,
« 'Tis well !"
They spake no further, and pursued their journey towards

the mountains and across the desert that was as a sea asleep
in the blazing heat, and the sun till his setting threw no
shade upon the sands bigger than what was broad above
them. By the beams of the growing moon they entered the
first gorge of the mountains. Here they relaxed the swift-
ness of their pace, picking their way over broken rocks and
stunted shrubs, and the mesh of spotted creeping plants; all
around them in shadow a freshness of noisy rivulets and cool
scents of flowers, asphodel and rose blooming in plots from
the crevices of the crags. These, as the troop advanced,
wound and widened, gradually receding, and their summits,
which were silver in the moonlight, took in the distance a
robe of purple, and the sides of the mountains were rounded
away in purple beyond a space of emerald pasture. Now,
Ruark beheld the heaviness of Bhanavar, and that she
drooped in her seat, and he halted her by a cave at the foot
of the mountains, browed with white broom. Before it, over
grass and cresses, ran a rill, a branch from others, larger
ones, that went hurrying from the heights to feed the
meadows below, and Bhanavar dipped her hand in the rill,
and thought, “I am no more as thou, rill of the mountain,
but a desert thing! Thy way is forward, thy end before
thee; but I go this way and that; my end is dark to me ;
not a life is mine that will have its close kissing the cold
cheeks of the saffron-crocus. Cold art thou, and I-flames !
They that lean to thee are refreshed, they that touch me
perish.” Then she looked forth on the stars that were above
the purple heights, and the blushes of inner heaven that
streamed up the sky, and a fear of meeting the eyes of her
kindred possessed her, and she cried out to Ruark, “O Chief
of the Beni-Asser, must this be? and is there no help for it,
but that I return among them that look on me basely?"
Ruark stooped to her and said, “Tell me thy name."
She answered, “ Bhanavar is my name with that people.”
And he whispered, “Surely when they speak of thee they
say not Bhanavar solely, but Bhanavar the Beautiful ?”
refreshert thou, Sissing the me;

She started and sought the eye of the Chief, and it was
fixed on her face in a softened light, as if his soul had said
that thing. Then she sighed, and exclaimed, “Unhappy
are the beautiful ! born to misery! Allah dressed them in
his grace and favour for their certain wretchedness! Lo,
their countenances are as the sun, their existence as the
desert; barren are they in fruits and waters, a snare to
themselves and to others !”
Now, the Chief leaned to her yet nearer, saying, “ Show
me the Jewel.”
Bhanavar caught up her hands and clenched them, and
she cried bitterly, “T is known to thee! She told thee,
and there be none that know it not !”
Arising, she thrust her hand into her bosom, and held
forth the Jewel in the palm of her white hand. When
Ruark beheld the marvel of the Jewel, and the redness
moving in it as of a panting heart, and the flashing eye of
fire that it was, and all its glory, he cried, “It was indeed a
Jewel for queens to covet from the Serpent, and a prize the
noblest might risk all to win as a gift for thee."
Then she said, “Thy voice is friendly with me, O Ruark !
and thou scornest not the creature that I am. Counsel me
as to my dealing with the Jewel."
Surely the eyes of the Chief met the eyes of Bhanavar as
when the brightest stars of midnight are doubled in a clear
dark lake, and he sang in measured music :
Shall I counsel the moon in her ascending ?
Stay under that tall palm-tree through the night;
Rest on the mountain-slope
By the couching antelope,
O thou enthroned supremacy of light!
And for ever the lustre thou art lending,
Lean on the fair long brook that leaps and leaps,-
Silvery leaps and falls.
Hang by the mountain walls,
Moon! and arise no more to crown the steeps,
For a danger and dolour is thy wending!

“And, O Bhanavar, Bhanavar the Beautiful! shall I counsel
thee, moon of loveliness,- bright, full, perfect moon !-counsel
thee not to ascend and be seen and worshipped of men,
sitting above them in majesty, thou that art thyself the
Jewel beyond price ? Wah! what if thou cast it from thee?
—thy beauty remaineth !”
And Bhanavar smote her palms in the moonlight, and
exclaimed, “How then shall I escape this in me, which is a
curse to them that approach me?"
And he replied :
Long we the less for the pearl of the sea
Because in its depths there's the death we flee?
Long we the less, the less, woe 's me!
Because thou art deathly,—the less for thee ?
She sang aloud among the rocks and the caves and the
illumined waters :
Destiny! Destiny! why am I so dark ?
I that have beauty and love to be fair.
Destiny! Destiny! am I but a spark
Track'd under heaven in flames and despair ?
Destiny! Destiny! why am I desired
Thus like a poisonous fruit, deadly sweet?
Destiny! Destiny! lo, my soul is tired,
Make me thy plaything no more, I entreat!
Ruark laughed low, and said, “What is this dread of
Rukrooth my mother which weigheth on thee but silliness !
For she saw thee willing to do well by her; and thou with
thy Jewel, 0 Bhanavar, do thou but well by thyself, and
there will be no woman such as thou in power and excellence
of endowments, as there is nowhere one such as thou in
beauty.” Then he sighed to her, “Dare I look up to thee, O my
Queen of Serpents ?” And he breathed as one that is losing
breath, and the words came from him, “My soul is thine !"
When she heard him say this, great trouble was on the
damsel, for his voice was not the voice of Zurvan her betrothed;

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
and she remembered the sorrow of Rukrooth. She would
have fled from him, but a dread of the displeasure of the
Chief restrained her, knowing Ruark a soul of wrath. Her
eyelids dropped, and she was silent; and the Chief gazed on
her eagerly, and sang in a passion of praises of her; and the
fires of his love had a tongue, and he told her of his torment;
his speech was a torrent of flame at the feet of the damsel.
And Bhanavar exclaimed, “Oh, what am I, what am I, who
have slain my love, my lover!—that one should love me and
call on me for love? My life is a long weeping for him !
Death is my wooer !”.
Ruark still pleaded with her, and she said in fair gentleness,
“Speak not of it now in the freshness of my grief! Other
times and seasons are there. My soul is but newly widowed !"
Fierce was the eye of the Chief, and he sprang up, crying,
“By the life of my head, I know thy wiles and the reading
of these delays: but I'll never leave thee, nor lose sight of
thee, Bhanavar! And think not to fly from me, thou subtle,
brilliant Serpent! for thy track is my track, and thy con-
dition my condition, and thy fate my fate. By Allah ! this is so."
Then he strode from her swiftly, and called to his Arabs.
They had kindled a fire to roast the flesh of a buffalo,
slaughtered by them from among a herd, and were laughing
and singing beside the flames of the fire. So by the direction
of their Chief the Arabs brought slices of sweet buffalo-flesh
to Bhanavar, with cakes of grain : and Bhanavar ate alone,
and drank from the waters before her. Then they laid for
her a couch within the cave, and the aching of her spirit was
lulled, and she slept there a dreamless sleep till morning.
By the morning light Bhanavar looked abroad for the
Chief, and he was nowhere by. A pang of violent hope
struck through her, and she pressed her bosom, praying he
might have left her, and climbed the clefts and ledges of the
mountain to search over the fair expanse of pasture beyond,
for a trace of him departing. The sun was on the heads of
the heavy flowers, and a flood of gold down the gorges, and

a delicate rose hue on the distant peaks and upper dells of
snow, which were as a crown to the scene she surveyed;
but no sight of Ruark had she. And now she was beginning
to rejoice, but on a sudden her eye caught far to east a
glimpse of something in motion across an even slope of the
lower hills leaning to the valley; and it was a herd that
rushed forward, like a black torrent of the mountains flinging
foam this way and that, and after the herd and at the sides
of the herd she distinguished the white cloaks and scarfs and
glittering steel of the Arabs of Ruark. Presently she saw a
horseman break from the rest, and race in a line toward her.
She knew this one for Ruark, and sighed and descended
slowly to meet him. The greeting of the Chief was sharp,
his manner wild, and he said little ere he said, “I will
see thee under the light of the Jewel, so tie it in a band and
set it on thy brow, Bhanavar !”
Her mouth was open to intercede with his desire, but his
forehead became black as night, and he shouted in the thunder
of his lion-voice, “Do this !”.
She shuddered, and took the Jewel from its warm bed in
her bosom, and held it, and got together a band of green
weeds, and set it in the middle of the band, and tied the
band on her brow, and lifted her countenance to the Chief.
Ruark stood back from her and gazed on her; and he would
have veiled his sight from her, but his hand fell. Then the
might of her loveliness seized Bhanavar likewise, and the full
orbs of her eyes glowed on the Chief as on a mirror, and she
moved her serpent figure scornfully, and smiled, saying, “Is
it well ?"
And he, when he could speak, replied, “T is well! I
have seen thee ! for now can I die this day, if it be that I am
to die. And well it is ! for now know I there is truly
no place but the tomb can hold me from thee !”
Bhanavar put the Jewel from her brow into her bosom, and
questioned him, “What is thy dread this day, O my Chief?”
He answered her gravely, “I have seen Rukrooth my

mother while I slept; and she was weeping, weeping by
a stream, yea, a stream of blood; and it was a stream that
flowed in a hundred gushes from her own veins. The sun of
this dawn now, seest thou not ? 't is overcrimson; the vulture
hangeth low down yonder valley.” And he cried to her,
“Haste ! mount with me; for I have told Rukrooth a thing;
and I know that woman crafty in the thwarting of schemes ;
such a fox is she where aught accordeth not with her fore-
castings, and the judgement of her love for me! By Allah!
't were well we clash not; for that I will do I do, and that
she will do doth she."
So, the twain mounted their steeds, and Ruark gathered
his Arabs and placed them, some in advance, some on either
side of Bhanavar; and they rode forward to the head of the
valley, and across the meadows, through the blushing crowds
of flowers, baths of freshest scents, cool breezes that awoke in
the nostrils of the mares neighings of delight; and these
pranced and curvetted and swung their tails, and gave ex-
pression to their joy in many graceful fashions; but a gloom
was on Ruark, and a quick fire in his falcon-eye, and he rode
with heels alert on the flanks of his mare, dashing onward to
right and left, as do they that beat the jungle for the
crouching tiger. Once, when he was well-nigh half a league
in front, he wheeled his mare, and raced back full on
Bhanavar, grasping her bridle, and hissing between his
teeth, “Not a soul shall have thee save I: by the tomb of
my fathers, never, while life is with us!”
And he taunted her with bitter names, and was as one in
the madness of intoxication, drunken with the aspect of her
matchless beauty and with exceeding love for her. And
Bhanavar knew that the dread of a mishap was on the mind
of the Chief.
Now, the space of pasture was behind them a broad lake
of gold and jasper, and they entered a region of hills,
heights, and fastnesses, robed in forests that rose in rounded
swells of leafage, each over each-above all points of snow

that were as flickering silver flames in the farthest blue.
This was the country of Bhanavar, and she gazed mourn-
fully on the glades of golden green and the glens of iron
blackness, and the wild flowers, wild blossoms, and weeds
well known to her that would not let her memory rest, and
were wistful of what had been. And she thought, “My
sisters tend the flocks, my mother spinneth with the maidens
of the tribe, my father hunteth; how shall I come among
them but stranger Coldly will they regard me; I shall feel
them shudder when they take me to their bosoms."
She looked on Ruark to speak with him, but the mouth of
the Chief was set and white; and even while she looked,
cries of treason and battle arose from the Arabs that were
ahead, hidden by a branching wind of the way round a
mountain slant. Then the eyes of the Chief reddened, his
nostrils grew wide, the darkness of his face was as flame
mixed with smoke, and he seized Bhanavar and hastened
onward, and lo! yonder were his men over-matched, and
warriors of the mountains bursting on them from an ambush
on all sides. Ruark leapt in his seat, and the light of
combat was on him, and he dug his knees into his mare, and
shouted the war-cry of his tribe, lifting his hands as it were
to draw down wrath from the very heavens, and rushed to
the encounter. Says the poet:
Hast thou seen the wild herd by the jungle galloping close ?
With a thunder of hooves they trample what heads may oppose :
Terribly, crushingly, tempest-like, onward they sweep :
But a spring from the reeds, and the panther is sprawling in air,
And with muzzle to dust and black beards foam-lash'd, here and there,
Scatter'd they fly, crimson-eyed, track'd with blood to the deep.
Such was the onset of Ruark, his stroke the stroke of
death; and ere the echoes had ceased rolling from that cry
of his, the mountain-warriors were scattered before him on
the narrow way, hurled down the scrub of the mountain,
even as dead leaves and loosened stones; so like an arm of
lightning was the Chief !

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Now Ruark pursued them, and was lost to Bhanavar
round a slope of the mountain. She quickened her pace
to mark him in the glory of the battle, and behold ! a
sudden darkness enveloped her, and she felt herself in the
swathe of tightened folds, clasped in an arm, and borne
rapidly she knew not whither, for she could hear and see
nothing. It was to her as were she speeding constantly down-
ward in darkness to the lower realms of the Genii of the
Caucasus, and every sense, and even that of fear, was
stunned in her. How long an interval had elapsed she
knew not, when the folds were unwound ; but it was light
of day, and the faces of men, and they were warriors that
were about her, warriors of the mountain ; but of Ruark
and his Arabs no voice. So she said to them, “What do
ye with me?”
And one among them, that was a youth of dignity and
grace, and a countenance like morning on the mountains,
answered, “The will of Rukrooth, O lady! and it is the
plight of him we bow to with Rukrooth, mother of the
Desert-Chief."
She cried, “Is he here, the Prince, that I may speak with
him ? "
The same young warrior made answer, “ Not so; fore-
warned was be, and well for him!”
Bhanavar drew her robe about her and was mute. Ere the
setting of the moon they journeyed on with her; and con-
tinued so three days and nights through the defiles and
ravines and matted growths of the mountains. On the
fourth dawn they were on the summit of a lofty mountain-
rise ; below them the sun, shooting a current of gold across
leagues of sea. Then he that had spoken with Bhanavar
said, “A sail will come,” and a sail came from under the
sun. Scarce had the ship grated shore, when the warriors
lifted Bhanavar, and waded through the water with her, and
placed her unwetted in the ship, and one, the fair youth
among the warriors, sprang on board with her, remaining by

45
her. So the captain pushed off, and the wind filled the
sails, and Bhanavar was borne over the lustre of the sea,
that was as a changing opal in its lustre, even as a melted
jewel flowing from the fingers of the maker, the Almighty
One. The ship ceased not sailing till they came to a narrow
strait, where the sea was but a river between fair sloping
hills alight with towers and palaces, opening a way to a
great city that was in its radiance over the waters of the sea
as the aspect of myriad sheeny white doves breasting the
wave. Hitherto the young warrior had held aloof in cold-
ness of courtesy from Bhanavar; but now he sat by her, and
said, “The bond between my prince and Rukrooth is accom-
plished, and it was to snatch thee from the Chief of the
Beni-Asser and bring thee even to this city.”
Bhanavar exclaimed, “ Allah be praised in all things, and
his will done!”
The youth continued, “Thou art alone here, 0 lady, ex-
posed to the perils of loneliness ; surely it were well if I
linger with thee awhile, and see to thy welfare in this city,
even as a brother with a sister; and I will deal honourably
by thee.”
Bhanavar looked on the young warrior and blushed at his
exceeding sweetness with her; the soft freshness of his
voice was to lier as the blossom-laden breeze in the valleys
of the mountains, and she breathed low the words of her
gratitude, saying, “If I am not a burden, let this be so."
Then said he, “Know me by my name, which is Almeryl;
and that we seem indeed of one kin, make known unto me
thine."
She replied, “Ill-omened is it, this name of Bhanavar!”
The youth among warriors gazed on her a moment with
the fluttering eye of bashfulness, and said, “ Can they that
have marked thee call thee other than Bhanavar the
Beautiful ?"
She remembered that Ruark had spoken in like manner,
and the curse of her beauty smote her, and she thougkit,

“This fair youth, he hath not a mother to watch over him
and ward off souls of evil. I dread there will come a mis-
hap to him through me; Allah shield him from it !” And
she sought to dissuade him from resting by her, but he
cried, “'T is but a choice to dwell with thee or with the
dogs in the street outside thy door, O Bhanavar !"
Now, the ship sailed close up to the quay, and cast anchor
there in the midst of other ships of merchandise. Almeryl
then threw a robe over his mountain dress and spoke with
the captain apart, and he and Bhanavar took leave of the
captain, and landed on the quay among the porters, and of
these one stepped forward to them and shouted cheerily,
“Where be the burdens and the bales, 0 ye, fair couple
fashioned in the eye of elegant proportions? Ye twin palm-
trees, male and female! Wullahy! broad is the back of
your servant.”
Almeryl beckoned to him that he should follow them, and
he followed them, blessing the wind that had brought them
to that city and the day. So they passed through the streets
and lanes of the city, and the porter pointed out this house
and that house wanting an occupant, and Almeryl fixed on
one in an open thoroughfare that had before it a grass-plot,
and behind a garden with fountains and flowers, and grass-
knolls shaded by trees; and he paid down the half of its
price, and had it furnished before nightfall sumptuously,
and women in it to wait on Bhanavar, and stuffs and goods,
and scents for the bath,--all luxuries whatsoever that trades-
men and merchants there could give in exchange for gold.
Then Almeryl dismissed the porter in Allah's name, and
gladdened his spirit with a gift over the due of his hire that
exalted him in the eyes of the porter, and the porter went
from him, exclaiming, “In extremity Ukleet is thy slave!”
and he sang :
Shouldst thou see a slim youth with a damsel arriving,
Be sure 't is the hour when thy fortune is thriving;
A generous fee makes the members so supple
That over the world they could carry this couple.

THE STORY OF BHANAVAR.
Now, so it was that the youth Almeryl and the damsel
Bhanavar abode in the city they had come to weeks and
months, and life to either of them as the flowing of a gentle
stream, even as brother and sister lived they, chastely, and
with temperate feasting. Surely the youth loved her with a
great love, and the heart of Bhanavar turned not from him,
and was won utterly by his gentleness and nobleness and
devotion ; and they relied on each other's presence for any
joy, and were desolate in absence, as the poet says:
When we must part, love,
Such is my smart, love,
Sweetness is savourless,
Hairness is favourless!
But when in sight, love,
We two unite, love,
Earth has no sour to me;
Life is a flower to me!
And with the increase of every day their passion increased,
and the revealing light in their eyes brightened and was
humid, as is sung by him that luted to the rage of hearts :
Even’s star yonder
Comes like a crown on us,
Larger and fonder
Grows its orb down on us;
So, love, my love for thee
Blossoms increasingly;
So sioks it in the sea,
Waxing unceasingly.
On a night, when the singing-girls had left them, the
youth could contain himself no more, and caught the two
hands of Bhanavar in his, saying, “ This that is in my soul
for thee thou knowest, О Bhanavar' and 't is spoken when I
move and when I breathe, O my loved one! Tell me then
the cause of thy shunning me whenever I would speak of it,
and be plain with thee.”
For a moment Bhanavar sought to release herself from his
hold, but the love in his eyes entangled her soul as in a net,

and she sank forward to him, and sighed under his chin, “T
was indeed my very love of thee that made me."
The twain embraced and kissed a long kiss, and leaned
sideways together, and Bhanavar said, “Hear me, what I
am.”
Puce passage ofingers to thow Rukim
Then she related the story of the Serpent and the Jewel,
and of the death of her betrothed. When it was ended,
Almeryl cried, “And was this all ?—this that severed us?”
And he said, “ Hear what I am.”
So, he told Bhanavar how Rukrooth, the mother of Ruark,
had sent messengers to the Prince his father, warning him of
the passage of Ruark through the mountains with one a
Queen of Serpents, a sorceress, that had bewitched him and
enthralled him in a mighty love for her, to the ruin of
Ruark; and how the Chief was on his way with her to
demand her in marriage at the hands of her parents; and the
words of Rukrooth were, “ By the service that was between
thee and my husband, and hy the death he died, O Prince,
rescue the Chief my son from this damsel, and entrap her
from him, and have her sent even to the city of the inland
ea, for no less a distance than that keepeth Ruark from
'er."
And Almeryl continued, “I questioned the messengers
myself, and they told me the marvel of thy loveliness and
the peril to him that looked on it, so I swore there was no
power should keep me from a sight of thee, O my loved one !
my prize! my life! my sleek antelope of the hills ! Surely
when my father appointed the warriors to lay in wait for
thy coming, I slipped among them, so that they thought it
ordered by him I should head them. The rest is known to
thee, O my fountain of blissfulness ! but the treachery
to Ruark was the treachery of Ebn Asrac, not of such
warriors as we; and I would have fallen on Ebn Asrac, had
not Ruark so routed that man without faith. 'T was all as I
have said, blessed be Allah and his decrees !”
Bhanavar gazed on her beloved, and the bridal dew over-

flowed her underlids, and she loosed her hair to let it flow,
part over her shoulders, part over his, and in sighs that were
the measure of music she sang :
I thought not to love again!
But now I love as I loved not before;
I love not; I adore !
O my beloved, kiss, kiss me! waste thy kisses like a rain.
Are not thy red lips fain ?
Oh, and so softly they greet!
Am I not sweet?
Sweet must I be for thee, or sweet in vain :
Sweet to thee only, my dear love!
The lamps and censers sink, but cannot cheat
These eyes of thine that shoot above,
Trembling lustres of the dove!
A darkness drowns all lustres : still I see
Thee, my love, thee!
Thee, my glory of gold, from head to feet!
Ob, how the lids of the world close quite when our lips meet!
Almeryl strained her to him, and responded :
My life was midnight on the mountain side ;
Cold stars were on the heights :
There, in my darkness, I had lived and died,
Content with nameless lights.
Sudden I saw the heavens flush with a beam,
And I ascended soon,
And evermore over mankind supreme,
Stood silver in the moon.
And he fell playfully into a new metre, singing:
Who will paint my beloved
In musical word or colour ?
Earth with an envy is moved :
Sea-shells and roses she brings,
Gems from the green ocean-springs,
Fruits with the fairy bloom-dews,
Feathers of Paradise hues,

Waters with jewel-bright falls,
Ore from the Genii-halls :
All in their splendour approved ;
All; but, match'd with my beloved,
Darker, and denser, and duller.
Then she kissed him for that song, and sang :
Once to be beautiful was my pride,
And I blush'd in love with my own bright brow :
Once, when a wooer was by my side,
I worshipp'd the object that had his vow :
Different, different, different now,
Different now is my beauty to me :
Different, different, different now !
For I prize it alone because prized by thee.
Almeryl stretched his arm to the lattice, and drew it open,
letting in the soft night wind, and the sound of the fountain
and the bulbul and the beam of the stars, and versed to her
in the languor of deep love :
Whether we die or we live,
Matters it now no more :
Life has nought further to give :
Love is its crown and its core.
Come to us either, we're rife,-
Death or life!
Death can take not away,
Darkness and light are the same :
We are beyond the pale ray,
Wrapt in a rosier flame:
Welcome which will to our breath,-
Life or death!
So did these two lovers lute and sing in the stillness of the
night, pouring into each other's ears melodies from the new
sea of fancy and feeling that flowed through them. Ere they
ceased their sweet interchange of tenderness, which was but
one speech from one soul, a glow of light ran up the sky, and

the edge of a cloud was fired; and in the blooming of dawn
Almeryl hung over Bhanavar, and his heart ached to see the
freshness of her wondrous loveliness; and he sang, looking
on her:
The rose is living in her cheeks,
The lily in her rounded chin;
She speaks but when her whole soul speaks,
And then the two flow out and in,
And mix their red and white to make
The hue for which I'd Paradise forsake.
Her brow from her black falling hair
Ascends like morn : her nose is clear
As morning hills, and finely fair
With pearly nostrils curving near
The red bow of her upper lip;
Her bosom 's the white wave beneath the ship.
The fair full earth, the enraptured skies,
She images in constant play:
Night and the stars are in her eyes,
But her sweet face is beaming day,
A bounteous interblush of flowers :
A dewy brilliance in a dale of bowers.
Then he said, “And this morning shall our contract of
marriage be written and witnessed ?”
She answered, “ As my lord willeth ; I am his."
Said he, “ And it is thy desire ?"
She nestled to him and dinted his bare arm with the
pearls of her mouth for a reply.
So, that morning their contract of marriage was written,
and witnessed by the legal number of witnesses in the
presence of the Cadi, with his license on it endorsed; and
Bhanavar was the bride of Almeryl, he her husband. Never
was youth blessed in a bride like that youth !
Now, the twain lived together the circle of a full year of
delightful marriage, and love lessened not in them, but was
as the love of the first day. Little cared they, having each

other, for the loneliness of their dwelling in that city, where
they knew none save the porter Ukleet, who went about
their commissions. Sometimes to amuse themselves with his
drolleries, they sent for him, and were bountiful with him,
and made him drink with them on the lawn of their garden
leaning to an inlet of the sea; and then he would entertain
them with all the scandal and gossip of the city, and its little
folk and great. When he was outrageously extravagant in
these stories of his, Bhanavar exclaimed, “Are such things,
now ? can it be true ?"
And he nodded in his conceit, and replied loftily, “'T is
certain, O my Prince and Princess ! ye be from the moun-
tains, unused to the follies and dissipations of men when
they herd; and ye know them not, men !"
The lamps being lit in the garden to the edges of the
water, where they lay one evening, Ukleet, who had been in
his briskest mood, became grave, and put his forefinger to
the side of his nose and began, “Hear ye aught of the great
tidings ? Wullahy! no other than the departure of the wife
of Boolp, the broker, into darkness. T is of Boolp ye hire
this house, and had ye a hundred houses in this city ye
might have had them from Boolp the broker, he that 's rich;
and glory to them whom Allah prospereth, say I! And I
mention this matter, for 't is certain now Boolp will take
another wife to him to comfort him, for there be two things
beloved of Boolp, and therein manifesteth he taste and the
discernment of excellence, and what is approved ; and of
these two things let the love of his hoards of the yellow-
skinned treasure go first, and after that attachment to the
silver-skinned of creation, the fair, the rapturous; even to
them ! So by this see ye not Boolp will yearn in his soul for
another spouse ? Now, O ye well-matched pair! what a
chance were this, knew ye but a damsel of the mountains,
exquisite in symmetry, a moon to enrapture the imagination
of Boolp, and in the nature of things herit his possessions !
for Boolp is an old man, even very old."

They laughed, and cried, “We know not of such a damsel,
and the broker must go unmarried for us."
When next Ukleet sat before them, Almeryl took occasion
to speak of Boolp again, and said, “This broker, 0 Ukleet,
is he also a lender of money ?”
Ukleet replied, “O my Prince, he is or he is not: 't is of
the maybes. I wot truly Boolp is one that baiteth the hook
of an emergency."
The brows of the Prince were downcast, and he said no
more; but on the following morning he left Bhanavar early
under a pretext, and sallied forth from the house of their
abode alone.
Since their union in that city they had not been once
apart, and Bhanavar grieved and thought, “Waneth his love
for me?” and she called her women to her, and dressed in
this dress and that dress, and was satisfied with none. The
dews of the bath stood cold upon her, and she trembled, and
fled from mirror to mirror, and in each she was the same
surpassing vision of loveliness. Then her women held a
glass to her, and she examined herself closely, if there might
be a fleck upon her anywhere, and all was as the snow
of the mountains on her round limbs sloping in the curves
of harmony, and the faint rose of the dawn on slants of
snow was their hue. Twining her fingers and sighing, she
thought, “It is not that ! he cannot but think me beau-
tiful.” She smiled a melancholy smile at her image in the
glass, exclaiming, “What availeth it, thy beauty ? for he is
away and looketh not on thee, thou vain thing! And what
of thy loveliness if the light illumine it not, for he is the
light to thee, and it is darkness when he 's away.”
Suddenly she thought, “ What 's that which needeth to
light it no other light? I had well-nigh forgotten it in my
bliss, the Jewel!” Then she went to a case of ebony-wood,
where she kept the Jewel, and drew it forth, and shone in
the beam of a pleasant imagination, thinking, “ 'T will sur-
prise him!” And she robed herself in a robe of saffron, and

set lesser gems of the diamond and the emerald in the braid
of her hair, and knotted the Serpent Jewel firmly in a band
of gold-threaded tissue, and had it woven in her hair among
the braids. In this array she awaited his coming, and
pleased her mind with picturing his astonishment and the
joy that would be his. Mute were the women who waited
on her, for in their lives they had seen no such sight as
Bhanavar beneath the beams of the Jewel, and the whole
chamber was aglow with her.
Now, in her anxiety she sent them one and one repeatedly
to look forth at the window for the coming of the Prince.
So, when he came not she went herself to look forth, and
stretched her white neck beyond the casement. While her
head was exposed, she heard a cry of some one from the
house in the street opposite, and Bhanavar beheld in the
house of the broker an old wrinkled fellow that gesticulated
to her in a frenzy. She snatched her veil down and drew in
her head in anger at him, calling to her maids, “What is
yonder hideous old dotard ?”
And they answered, laughing, “'T is indeed Boolp the
broker, O fair mistress and mighty!"
To divert herself she made them tell her of Boolp, and
they told her a thousand anecdotes of the broker, and verses
of him, and the constancy of his amorous condition, and his
greediness. And Bhanavar was beguiled of her impatience
till it was evening, and the Prince returned to her. So they
embraced, and she greeted him as usual, waiting what he
would say, searching his countenance for a token of wonder-
ment; but the youth knew not that aught was added to her
beauty, for he looked nowhere save in her eyes. Bhanavar
was nigh weeping with vexation, and pushed him from her,
and chid him with lack of love and weariness of her; and
the eye of the Prince rose to her brow to read it, and he saw
the Jewel. Almeryl clapped his hands, crying, “Wondrous !
And this thy surprise for me, my fond one? beloved of
mine ! ” Then he gazed on her a space, and said, “Knowest

55
thou, thou art terrible in thy beauty, Bhanavar, and hast the
face of lightning under that Jewel of the Serpent ?"
She kissed him, whispering, “Not lightning to thee !
Yet lovest thou Bhanavar ?”
He replied, “Surely so; and all save Bhanavar in this
world is the darkness of oblivion to me.”
When it was the next morning, Almeryl rose to go forth
again. Ere he had passed the curtain of the chamber, Bha-
navar caught him by the arm, and she was trembling vio-
lently. Her visage was a wild inquiry : “ Thou goest -and
again? There is something hidden from me!”.
Almeryl took her to his heart, and caressed her with fond
flatteries, saying, “ Ask but what is beating under these two
pomegranates, and thou learnest all of me."
But she stamped her foot, crying, "No! no ! I will hear it!
There's a mystery."
So, he said, “Well, then, it is this only; small matter
enough. I have a business with the captain of the vessel that
brought us hither, and I must see him ere he setteth sail ; no
other than that, thou jealous, watchful star! Pierce me with
thine eyes; it is no other than that.”
She levelled her lids at him till her lustrous black eyelashes
were as arrows, and mimicked him softly,“No other than that?"
And he replied, “Even so."
Then she clung to him like a hungry creature, repeating,
“Even so," and let him go. Alone, she summoned a slave,
a black, and bade him fetch to her without delay Ukleet the
porter: and the porter was presently ushered in to her, pro-
testing service and devotion. So, she questioned him of
Almery), and the Prince's business abroad, what he knew of
it. Ukleet commenced reciting verses on the ills of jealousy,
but Bhanavar checked him with an eye that Ukleet had seen
never before in woman or in man, and he gaped at her help-
lessly, as one that has swallowed a bone. She laughed,
crying, “Learn, thou fellow, to answer my like by the letter.”
Now, what she heard from Ukleet when he had recovered

his wits, was that the Prince had a business with none save
the lenders of money. So she spake to Ukleet in a kindly
tone, “ Thou art mine, to serve me?”
He was as one fascinated, and delivered himself, “Yea, O
my mistress! with tongue-service, toe-service, back-service,
brain-service, whatso pleaseth thy sweet presence.”
Said she, “ Hie over to the broker opposite, and bring him
hither to me.”
Ukleet departed, saying, “ To hear is to obey."
She sat gazing on the Jewel and its counterchanging splen-
dours in her hand, and the thought of Almeryl and his
necessity was her only thought. Not ten minutes of the hour
had passed before the women waiting on her announced Ukleet
and the broker Boolp. Bhanavar gave little heed to the old
fellow's grimaces, and the compliments he addressed her, but
handed him the Jewel and desired his valuation of its worth.
The face of Boolp was a keen edge when he regarded Bhanavar,
but the sight of the Jewel sharpened it tenfold, and he tossed
his arms, exclaiming. “A jewel, this !"
So,'Bhanavar cried to him, “Fix a price for it, 0 thou
broker !”
And Boolp, the old miser, debated, and began prating, “O
lady! the soul of thy slave is abashed by a double beam, this
the jewel of jewels, thou truly of thy sex; and saving thee
there's no jewel of worth like this one, and together ye be-
wullahy! never felt I aught like this since my espousal of
Soolka that's gone, and 't was' nothing like it then! Now, O
my Princess, confess it freely—this is but a pretext, this
valuation of the Jewel, and Ukleet our go-between; and leave
the rewarding of him to me. Wullahy! I can be generous,
and my days of favour with fair ladies be not yet over.
Blessed be Allah for this day! And thinkest thou those eyes
fell on me with discriminating observation ere my sense of
perception was struck by thee? Not so, for I had noted thee,
O moon of hearts, from my window yonder.”
In this fashion Boolp the broker went on prating, and

bowing, and screwing the corners of his little acid eyes to
wink the wink of common accord between himselfand Bhanavar.
Meantime she had spoken aside to one of her women, and a
second black slave entered the chamber, bearing in his hand
a twisted scourge, and that slave laid it on the back of Boolp
the broker, and by this means he was brought quickly to the
valuation of the Jewel. Then he named a sum that was a
great sum, but not the value of the Jewel to the fiftieth part,
nay nor the five-hundredth part, of its value; and Ukleet
remonstrated with him, but he was resolute, saying, “Even
that sum leaves me a beggar.”
So, Bhanavar said, “My desire is for immediate payment
of the money, and the Jewel is thine for that sum.”
Now the broker went to fetch the money, and returned
with it in bags of gold one-half the amount, and bags of
silver one-third, and the remainder in writing made due at a
certain period for payment. And he groaned and handed
her the money, and took the Jewel in his hands, ejaculating,
“In the name of Allah !”
That evening, when it was dark and the lamps lit in the
chamber, and the wines set and the nosegay, Almeryl asked
of Bhanavar to see her under the light of the Jewel. She
warded him with an excuse, but he was earnest with her. So
she feigned that he teased her, saying, “'T is that thou art
no longer content with me as I am, O my husband !” Then
she said, “Wert thou successful in thy dealings this day?”
His arm slackened round her, and he answered nothing.
So she cried, “Fie on thee, thou foolish one ! and what is
thy need of running over this city ? Know I not thy case
and thine occasion, O my beloved ? Surely I am Queen of
Serpents, a mistress of enchantments, a diviner of things
hidden, and I know thee. Here, then, is what thou re-
quirest, and conceal not from me thy necessity another time,
my husband !”
Upon that she pointed his eye to the money-bags of gold
and of silver. Almeryl was amazed, and asked her, “How

came these ? for I was at the last extremity, without coin of
any kind.”
She answered, “How, but by the Serpents !"
And he exclaimed, “Would that I might work as that
porter worketh, rather than this !”
Now, seeing he bewailed her use of the powers of the
Jewel, Bhanavar fell between his arms, and related to him
her discovery of his condition, and how she disposed of the
Jewel to the broker, and of the scourging of Boolp; and he
praised her, and clave to her, and they laughed and delighted
their souls in plenteousness, and bliss was their portion; as
the poet says,
Bliss that is born of mutual esteem
And tried companionship, I truly deem
A well-based palace, wherein fountains rise
From springs that have their sources in the skies,
So were they for awhile. It happened that one day, that
was the last day of the year since her wearing of the Jewel,
Ukleet said to them, “Be wary! the Vizier Aswarak hath
his eye on you, and it is no cool one. I say nothing: the
wise are discreet in their tellings of the great. 'T is certain
the broker Boolp forgetteth not his treatment here."
They smiled, turning to each other, and said, “We live
innocently, we harm no one, what should we fear?”
During the night of that day Bhanavar awoke and kissed
the Prince; and lo! he shuddered in his sleep as with the
grave-cold. A second time she was awakened on the breast.
of Almeryl by a dream of the Serpents of the Lake Karatis-
the lake of the Jewel ; and she stood up, and there was in
the street a hum of voices, and she saw there before the
house armed men with naked steel in their hands. Scarce
had she called Almeryl to her, when the outer door of their
house was forced, and she shrieked to him, “'T is thou they
come for : fly, O my Prince, my husband I the way of the
garden is clear.”

But he said sadly, “Nay, what am I ? it is thou they
would win from me. I'll leave thee not in this life.”
So, she cried, “O my soul, then together !—but I shall
hinder thee, and be a burden to thy flight.”
And she called on the All-powerful for aid, and ran with
him into the garden of the house, and lo! by the water-side
at the end of the garden a boat full of armed soldiers with
scimitars. So these fell upon them, and bound them, and
haled them into the house again, where was the dark Vizier
Aswarak, and certain officers of the night-watch with a force.
The Vizier cried when he saw them, “I accuse thee, Prince
Almeryl, of being here in the city of our lord the King, to
conspire against him and his authority.”
Almeryl faced the Vizier firmly, and replied, “I knew not
in my life I had made an enemy; but there is one here who
telleth that of me.”
The Vizier frowned, saying, “Thou deniest this ? And thou
here, and thy father at war with the sovereignty of our lord
the King !”
Almeryl beheld his danger, and he said, “Is this so ?”
Then cried the Vizier, “Hear him! is not that a fair
simulation?” So he called to the guard, "Shackle him!”
When that was done, he ordered the house to be sacked, and
the women and the slaves he divided for a spoil, but he re-
served Bhanavar to himself: and lo! twice she burst away
from them that held her to hang upon the lips of Almery),
and twice was she torn from him as a grape-bunch is torn
from the streaming vine, and the third time she swooned and
the anguish of life left her.
Now, Bhanavar was borne to the harem of the Vizier, and
for days she suffered no morsel of food to enter her mouth,
and was dying, had not the Vizier in the cunning of his
dissimulation fed her with distant glimpses of Almeryl, to
show her he yet lived. Then she thought, “ While my
beloved liveth, life is due to me ;" and she ate and drank
and reassumed her fair fulness and the queenliness that was

hers; but the Vizier had no love of her, and respected her,
considering in his mind, “ Time will exhaust the fury of
this tigress, and she is a fruit worth the waiting for.
Wullahy! I shall have possessed her ere the days of over-
ripening."
There was in the harem of the Vizier a mountain-girl that
had been brought there in her childhood, and trained to play
upon the lute and accompany her voice with the instrument.
To this little damsel Bhanavar gave her heart, and would
listen all day, as in a trance, to her luting, till the desire to
escape from that bondage and gather tidings of Almeryl
mastered her, and she persuaded one of the blacks of the
harem with a bribe to procure her an interview with the
porter Ukleet. So at a certain hour of the night Ukleet
was introduced into the garden of the harem, and he was in
the darkness of that garden a white-faced porter with knees
that knocked the dread-march together ; but Bhanavar
strengthened his soul, and he said to her, “ 'T was the doing
of Boolp the broker: and he whispered the Vizier of thee and
thy beauty, O my mistress ! Surely thy punishment and
this ruin is but part payment to Boolp of the price of the
Jewel, the great Jewel that's in the hands of the Vizier.”
Then she questioned him : “ And Almery), the Prince,
my husband, what of him ?”
Ukleet was silent, and Bhanavar asked to hear no more.
Surely she was at the gates of pale spirits within an hour of
her interview with Ukleet, and there was no blessedness for
her save in death, the stifler of ills, the drug that is infallible.
As is said :
Dark is that last stage of sorrow
Which from Death alone can borrow
Comfort:-
Bhanavar would have died then, but in a certain pause of
her fever the Vizier stood by her. She looked at him long
as she lay, and the life in her large eyes was ebbing away
slowly ; but there seemed presently a check, as an eddy

fever, and on the wait quickewed
comes in the stream, and the light of intelligence flowed
like a reviving fire into her eyes, and her heart quickened
with desire of life while she looked on the Vizier. So she
passed the pitch of that fever, and bloomed anew in her
beauty, and cherished it, for she had a purpose.
Now, there was rejoicing in the harem of the Vizier
Aswarak when Bhanavar arose from the couch ; and the
Vizier exulted, thinking, “I have tamed this wild beauty,
or she had reached death in that extremity.” So he allowed
Bhanavar greater freedom and indulgences, and Bhanavar
feigned to give her soul to the pleasures women delight in,
and the Vizier buried her in gems and trinkets and costly
raiment, robes of exquisite silks, the choicest of Samarcand
and China; and he permitted her to make purchases among
certain of the warehouses of the city and the shops of the
tradesmen, jewellers and others, so that she went about as
she would, but for the slaves that attended her and the over-
seer of the harem. This continued, and Aswarak became
urgent with her, and to remove suspicion from him she
named a day from that period when she would be his.
Meantime she contrived to see Ukleet the porter frequently,
and within a week of her engagement with the Vizier she
gazed from a lattice-window of the harem, and beheld in the
garden, by the beams of the moon, Ukleet, and he was look-
ing as on the watch for her. So she sent to him the little
mountain-girl she loved, but Ukleet would tell her nothing;
then went she herself, greeting him graciously, for his
service was other than that of self-seeking.
Ukleet said, “O Lady, mistress of hearts, moon of the
tides of will ! 't is certain I was thy slave from the hour I
beheld thee first, and of the Prince, thy husband; Allah
rest his soul! Now these be my tidings. Wullahy! the
King is one maddened with the reports I've spread about
of thy beauty, yea ! raging. And I have a friend in his
palace, even an under-cook, acute in the interpreting of
wishes. There was he always gabbling of thy case, O my

Princess, till the head-cook seized hold on it, and so it went
to the chamberlain, thence to the chief of the eunuchs, and
from him in a natural course, to the King. Now from the
King the tracking of this tale went to the under-cook down
again, and from him to me. So was I summoned to the
King, and the King discoursed with me—I with him, in fair
fluency; he in ejaculations of desire to have sight of thee, I
in expatiation on that he would see when he had his desire.
Now in this have I not done thee a service, O sovereign of
fancies ? "
Bhanavar mused and said, “On the after-morrow I pass
through the city to make a selection of goods, and I shall
pass at noon by the great mosque, on my way to the shop of
Ebn Roulchook, the King's jeweller, beyond the meat-market.
Of a surety, I know not how my lord the King may see
me.”
Said the porter, “'Tis enough ! on my head be it.” And
he went from her, singing the song:
How little a thing serves Fortune's turn
When she's intent on doing!
How easily the world may burn
When kings come out a-wooing!
Now, ere she set forth on the after-morrow to make her
purchases, Bhanavar sent word to the Vizier Aswarak that
she would see him, and he came to her drunken with
alacrity, for he augured favourably that her reluctance was
melting toward him : so she said, “O my master, my time
of mourning is at an end, and I would look well before thee,
even as one worthy of being thy bride; so bestow on me, I
pray thee, for my wearing that day, the jewels that be in
thy treasury, the brightest and clearest of them, and the
largest.”
The Vizier Aswarak replied, and he was one in great
satisfaction of soul, “ All that I have are thine. Wullahy!
and one, a marvel, that I bought of Boolp the broker, that

had it from an African merchant.” So he commanded the
box wherein he had deposited the jewel to be brought to
him there in the chamber of Bhanavar, and took forth the
Serpent Jewel between his forefinger and thumb, and laughed
at the eager eyes of Bhanavar when she beheld it, saying,
“'T is thine ! thy bridal gift the day I possess thee."
Bhanavar trembled at the sight of the Jewel, and its
redness was to her as the blood of Zurvan and Almeryl.
She stretched her hand out for it, and cried, “ This day, O
my lord, make it mine."
So, the Vizier said, “ Nay, what I have spoken will I keep
to; it has cost me much.”
Bhanavar looked at him, and uttered in a soft tone,
“Truly it has cost thee much."
Then she exclaimed, as in play, “See me, how I look by
its beam.” And in her guile she snatched the Jewel from
him, and held it to her brow. Then Aswarak started from
her and feared her, for the red light of the Jewel glowed, and
darkened the chamber with its beam, darkening all save the
lustre that was on the visage of Bhanavar. He shouted,
“ What's this ! Art thou a sorceress ?”
She removed the Jewel, and ceased glaring on him, and
said, “Nothing but thy poor slave !"
Then he coaxed her to give him the Jewel, and she would
not; he commanded her peremptorily, and she hesitated; so
he grasped her tightened hand, and his face loured with
wrath; yet she withheld the Jewel from him laughing; and
he was stirred to extreme wrath, and drew from his girdle
the naked scimitar, and menaced her with it. And he looked
mighty ; but she dreaded him little, and stood her full height
before him, daring him, and she was as the tigress defending
a cub from a wilder beast. Now when he was about to call
in the armed slaves of the palace, she said, “I warn thee,
Vizier Aswarak ! tempt me not to match them that serve me
with them that serve thee."
He ground his teeth in fury, crying, “A conspiracy ! and

in the harem! Now, thou traitress! the logic of the lash
shall be tried upon thee.” And he roared, “Ho! ye without
there !-ho!”
But ere the slaves had entered Bhanavar rubbed the
Jewel on her bosom, muttering, “I have forborne till now !
Now will I have a sacrifice, though I be it.” And rubbing
the Jewel, she sang, -
Hither! hither!
Come to your Queen;
Come through the gray wall,
Come through the green !
There was heard a noise like the noise of a wind coming
down a narrow gorge above falling waters, a hissing and a
rushing of wings, and behold ! Bhanavar was circled by rings
and rings of serpent-folds that glowed round her, twisted
each in each, with the fierceness of fire, she like a flame
rising up white in the midst of them. The black slaves,
when they had lifted the curtain of the harem-chamber,
shrieked to see her, and Aswarak crouched at her feet with
the aspect of an angry beast carved in stone. Then Bhanavar
loosed on either of the slaves a serpent, saying, “What these
have seen they shall not say.” And while the sweat dropped
heavily from the forehead of Aswarak, she stepped out of.
the circle of serpents, singing,
Over ! over!
Hie to the lake!
Sleep with the left eye,
Keep the right awake.
Then the serpents spread with a great whirr, and flew
through the high window and the walls as they had come,
and she said to the Vizier, “What now ? Fearest thou? I
have spared thee, thou that madest me desolate I and thy
slaves are a sacrifice for thee. Now this I ask : Where lies
my beloved, the Prince my husband & Speak nothing of
him, save the place of his burial !"

So, he told her, “ In the burial-ground of the great prison.”
She rolled her eyes on the Vizier darkly, exclaiming,
“Even where the felons lie entombed, he lieth !” And she
began to pant, pale with what she had done, and leaned to
the floor, and called, -
Yellow stripe, with freckle red,
Coil and curl, and watch by my head.
And a serpent with yellow stripes and red freckles came
like a javelin down to her, and coiled and curled round her
head, and she slept an hour. When she arose the Vizier
was yet there, sitting with folded knees. So she sped the
serpent to the Lake Karatis, and called her women to her,
and went to an inner room, and drew an outer robe and
a vest over that she had on, and passed the Vizier, and said,
“ Art thou not rejoiced in thy bride, O Aswarak ? 'T was a
wondrous clemency, hers! Now but four more days and
thou claimest her. Say nothing of what thou hast seen, or
thou wilt shortly see nothing further to say, my master."
So, she left the Vizier sitting still in that chamber, and
mounted a mule, attended by slaves on foot before and
behind her, and passed through the streets till she came to
the shop of Ebn Roulchook. The King was in disguise at
the extremity of the shop, and while she examined this and
that of the precious stones, Bhanavar for a moment made
bare the beauty of her face, and love's fires took fast hold of
the King, and he cried, “I marvel not at the eloquence of
the porter.”
Now, she made Ebn Roulchook bring to her a circlet of
gold, with a hollow in the frontal centre, and fit into that
hollow the Serpent Jewel. So, while she laughed and chatted
with her women Bhanavar lifted the circlet, and made her
countenance wholly bare even to the neck and the beginning
slope of the bosom, and fixed the circlet to her head with the
Jewel burning on her brow. Then when he beheld the glory
of excelling loveliness that she was, and the splendour in her

eyes under the Jewel, the King shouted and parted with his
disguise, and Ebn Roulchook and the women and slaves with
Bhanavar fled to the courtyard that was behind the shop,
leaving Bhanavar alone with the King. Surely Bhanavar
returned not to the dwelling of the Vizier.
Now, the King Mashalleed espoused Bhanavar, and she
became his queen and ruled him, and her word was the dictate
of the land. Then caused she the body of Almeryl, with
the severed head of the Prince, to be disinterred, and entombed
secretly in the palace; and she had lamps lit in the vault,
and the pall spread, and the readers of the Koran to read by
the tomb; and then stole to the tomb hourly, in the day and
in the night, wailing of him and her utter misery, repeating
verses at the side of the tomb, and they were,—
Take me to thee !
Like the deep-rooted tree,
My life is half in earth, and draws
Thence all sweetness; oh may my being pause
Soon beside thee !
Welcome me soon!
As to the queenly moon,
Man's homage to my beauty sets;
Yet am I a rose-shrub budding regrets :
Welcome me soon.
Soul of my soul!
Have me not half, but whole.
Dear dust, thou art my eyes, my breath!
Draw me to thee down the dark sea of death,
Soul of my soul !
And she sang:
Sad are they who drink life's cup
Till they have come to the bitter-sweet:
Better at once to toss it up,
And trample it beneath the feet;
For venom-charged as serpents' eggs
'T is then, and knows not other change.
Early, early, early, have I reached the dregs
Of life, and loathe and love the bitter-sweet, revenge!

THE STORY OF BHANAVAR.
Then turned she aside, and sang musingly:
I came to his arms like the flower of the spring,
And he was my bird of the radiant wing:
He flutter'd above me a moment, and won
The bliss of my breast as a beam of the sun,
Untouch'd and untasted till then-
The voice in her throat was like a drowning creature, and she
rose up, and chanted wildly:
I weep again ?
What play is this? for the thing is dead in me long since :
Will all the reviving rain
Of beaven bring me back my Prince ?
But I, when I weep, when I weep,
Blood will I weep !
And when I weep,
Sons for fathers shall weep;
Mothers for sons shall weep;
Wives for husbands shall weep!
Earth shall complain of floods red and deep,
When I weep!
Upon that she ran up a secret passage to her chamber and
rubbed the Jewel, and called the serpents, to delight her soul
with the sight of her power, and rolled and sported madly
among them, clutching them by the necks till their little thin
red tongues hung out, and their eyes were as discoloured
blisters of venom. Then she arose, and her arms and neck
and lips were glazed with the slime of the serpents, and she
flung off her robes to the close-fitting silken inner vest looped
across her bosom with pearls, and whirled in a mazy dance-
measure among them, and sang melancholy melodies, making
them delirious, fascinating them; and they followed her round
and round, in twines and twists and curves, with arched heads
and stiffened tails; and the chamber swam like an undulating
sea of shifting sapphire lit by the moon of midnight. Not
before the moon of midnight was in the sky ceased Bhanavar

ripened : and challeed his masith jealousy and
sporting with the serpents, and she sank to sleep exhausted
in their midst.
Such was the occupation of the Queen of Mashalleed when
he came not to her. The women and slaves of the palace
dreaded her, and the King himself was her very slave.
Meanwhile the plot of her unforgivingness against Aswarak
ripened : and the Vizier beholding the bride he had lost
Queen of Mashalleed his master, it was as she conceived,
that his heart was eaten with jealousy and fierce rage.
Bhanavar as she came across him spake mildly, and gave him
gentle looks, sad glances, suffering not his fires to abate, the
torment of his love to cool. Each night he awoke with a
serpent in his bed; the beam of her beauty was as the
constant bite of a serpent, poisoning his blood, and he deluded
his soul with the belief that Bhanavar loved him notwith-
standing, and that she was seized forcibly from him by the
King. “Otherwise,” thought he, “why loosed she not a
serpent from the host to strangle me even as yonder black
slaves ?" Bhanavar knew the mind of Aswarak, and con-
sidered, “The King is cunning and weak, a slave to his
desires, and in the bondage of the jewel, my beauty. The
Vizier is unscrupulous, a hatcher of intrigues; but that he
dreads me and hopes a favour of me, he would have wrought
against me ere now. T is then a combat 'twixt him and me.
O my soul, art thou dreaming of a fair youth that was the
bliss of thy bosom night and day, night and day? The
Vizier shall die !”
One morning, and it was a year from the day she had
become Queen of Mashalleed, Bhanavar sprang up quickly
from the side of the King; and he was gazing on her in
amazement and loathing. She flew to her chamber, chasing
forth her women, and ran to a mirror. Therein she saw
three lines that were on her brow, lines of age, and at the
corners of her mouth and about her throat a slackness of skin,
the skin no longer its soft rosy white, but withered brown
as leaves of the forest. She shrieked, and fell back in a

swoon of horror. When she recovered, she ran to the mirror
again, and it was the same sight. And she rose from swoon-
ing a third time, and still she beheld the visage of a hag;
nothing of beauty there save the hair and the brilliant eyes.
Then summoned she the serpents in a circle, and the number
of them was that of the days in the year: and she bared her
wrist and seized one, a grey-silver with sapphire spots, and
hissed at him till he hissed, and foam whitened the lips of
each. Thereupon she cried :
Treble-tongue and throat of hell,
What is come upon me, tell !
And the Serpent replied,
Jewel Queen! beauty's price !
'T is the time for sacrifice!
She grasped another, one of leaden colour, with yellow
bars and silver crescents, and cried :
Treble-tongue and throat of fire,
Name the creature ye require !
And the Serpent replied :
Ruby lip ! poison tooth!
We are hungry for a youth.
She grasped another that writhed in her fingers like liquid
emerald, and cried :
Treble-tongue and throat of glue !
How to know the one that's due ?
And the Serpent replied:
Breast of snow! baleful bliss !
He that wooing wins a kiss.
She clutched one at her elbow, a hairy serpent with yellow
languid eyes in flame-sockets and livid-lustrous length-a
disease to look on, and cried :
Treble-tongue and throat of gall!
There's a youth beneath the pall.

THE SHAVING OF SDAGPAT.
And the Serpent replied :
Brilliant eye ! bloody tear!
He has fed us for a year.
She squeezed that hairy serpent till her finger-points
whitened in his neck, and he dropped lifelessly, crying:
Treble-tongues and things of mud !
Sprang my beauty from his blood ?
And the Serpents rose erect, replying :
Yearly one of us must die ;
Yearly for us dieth one ;
Else the Queen an ugly lie
Lives till all our lives be done!
Bhanavar stood up, and hurried them to Karatis. When
she was alone she fell towards the floor, repeating, “ 'T is the
Curse !” Suddenly she thought, “ Yet another year my
beauty shall be nourished by my vengeance, yet another !
And, O Vizier, the kiss shall be thine, the kiss of doom ; for
I have doomed thee ere now. Thou, thou shalt restore me
to my beauty: that only love I now my Prince is lost.”
So, she veiled her face in the close veil of the virtuous,
and despatched Ukleet, whom she exalted in the palace of
the King, to the Vizier; and Ukleet stood before Aswarak,
and said, “ O Vizier, my mistress truly is longing for you
with excessive longing, and in what she now undergoeth is
forgotten an evil done by you to her; and she bids you come
and concert with her a scheme deliberately as to the getting
rid of this tyrant who is an affliction to her, and her life is
lessened by him.”
The Vizier was deceived by his passion, and he chuckled
and exclaimed, “My very dream ! and to mind me of her,
then, she sent the serpents! Wullahy, in the matter of
women, wait! For, as the poet declareth :
"'T is vanity our souls for such to vex;
Patience is a harvest of the sex.'

be at' + was unde even hens. I know
And they fret themselves not overlong for husbands that are
gone, these young beauties. I know them. Tell the Queen
of Serpents I am even hers to the sole of my foot.”
So, it was understood between them that the Vizier should
be at the gate of the garden of the palace that night, dis-
guised ; and the Vizier rejoiced, thinking, “If she have not
the Jewel with her, it shall go ill with me, and I foiled this
time !"
Ukleet then proceeded to the house of Boolp the broker,
fronting the gutted ruins where Bhanavar had been happy in
her innocence with Almery), the mountain prince, her hus-
band. Boolp was engaged haggling with a slave-merchant
the price of a fair slave, and Ukleet said to him, “Yet
awhile delay, 0 Boolp, ere you expend a fraction of treasure,
for truly a mighty bargain of jewels is waiting for you at the
palace of my lord the King. So come thither with all your
money-bags of gold and silver, and your securities, and your
bonds and dues in writing, for 't is the favourite of the King
requireth you to complete a bargain with her, and the price
of her jewels is the price of a kingdom.”
Said Boolp, “Hearing is compliance in such a case.”
And Ukleet continued, “What a fortune is yours, O
Boolp! truly the tide of fortune setteth into your lap. Fail
not, wullahy! to come with all you possess, or if you have
not enough when she requireth it to complete the bargain,
my mistress will break off with you. I know not if she
intend even other game for you, O lucky one !"
Boolp hitched his girdle and shrugged, saying, “'T is
she will fail, I wot, she, in having therewith to complete
the bargain between us. Wa! wa !—there! I 've done
this before now. Wullahy ! if she have not enough of her
rubies and pearls to outweigh me and my gold, go to, Boolp
will school her! What says the poet ?
• Earth and ocean search, East, West, and North, to the South,
None will match the bright rubies and pearls of her mouth.'

"Aha! what? O Ukleet! And he says:
"The lovely ones a bargain made
With me, and I renounced my trade,
Half-ruined ; “Ah!” said they, "return and win!
To even scales ourselves we will throw in !'"
How so ? But let discreetness reign and security flou-
risheth !”
Ukleet nodded at him, and repeated the distich :
Men of worth and men of wits
Shoot with two arrows, and make two hits.
So, he arranged with Boolp the same appointment as with
the Vizier, and returned to Queen Bhanavar.
Now, in the dark of night Aswarak stood within the gate
of the palace-garden of Mashalleed that was ajar, and a hand
from a veiled figure reached to him, and he caught it, in the
fulness of his delusion, crying, “Thou, my Queen?” But
the hand signified silence, and drew him past the tank of
the garden and through a court of the palace into a passage
lit with lamps, and on into a close-curtained chamber,
and beyond a heavy curtain into another, a circular passage
descending between black hangings, and at the bottom a
square vault draped with black, and in it precious woods
burning, oils in censers, and the odour of ambergris and
myrrh and musk floating in clouds, and the sight of the
Vizier was for a time obscured by the thickness of the
incenses floating. As he became familiar with the place, he
saw marked therein a board spread at one end with viands
and wines, and the nosegay in a water-vase, and cups of
gold and a service of gold,—every preparation for feasting
mightily. So the soul of Aswarak leapt, and he cried, “ Now
unveil thyself, O moon of our meeting, my mistress !"
The voice of Bhanavar answered him, “Not till we have
feasted and drunken, and it seemeth little in our eyes.
Surely the chamber is secure : could I have chosen one
better for our meeting, O Aswarak ? "

Upon that he entreated her to sit with him to the feast,
but she cried, “Nay! delay till the other is come.”
Cried he, “Another ?”
But she exclaimed, “Hush !” and saying thus went
forward to the foot of the passage, and Boolp was there,
following Ukleet, both of them under a weight of bags and
boxes. So she welcomed the broker, and led him to the
feast, he coughing and wheezing and blinking, unwitting the
vexation of the Vizier, nor that one other than himself was
there. When Boolp heard the voice of the Vizier, in
astonishment, addressing him, he started back and fell upon
his bags, and the task of coaxing him to the board was as
that of haling a distempered beast to the water. Then they
sat and feasted together, and Ukleet with them; and if
Aswarak or Boolp waxed impatient of each other's presence,
he whispered to them, “Only wait ! see what she reserveth
for you." And Bhanavar mused with herself, “Truly that
reserved shall be not long coming !” So they drank, and
wine got the mastery of Aswarak, so that he made no secret
of his passion, and began to lean to her and verse
extemporaneously in her ear; and she stinted not in her
replies, answering to his urgency in girlish guise, sighing
behind the veil, as if under love's influence. And the
Vizier pressed close, and sang :
'T is said that love brings beauty to the cheeks
Of them that love and meet, but mine are pale ;
For merciless disdain on me she wreaks,
And hides her visage from my passionate tale :
I have her only, only when she speaks.
Bhanavar, unveil!
I have thee, and I have thee not! Like one
Lifted by spirits to a shining dale
In Paradise, who seeks to leap and run
And clasp the beauty, but his foot doth fail,
For he is blind : ah! then more woful none !
Bhanavar, unveil!

IIe thrust the wine-cup to her, and she lifted it under her
veil, and then sang, in answer to him :
My beauty! for thy worth
Thank the Vizier!
He gives thee second birth :
Thank the Vizier!
His blooming life without a fault:
Thank the Vizier!
Is at thy foot in this blest vault :
Thank the Vizier!
He knoweth not he telleth such a truth,
Thank the Vizier!
That thou, thro’ him, spring'st fresh in blushing youth :
Thank the Vizier!
He knoweth little now, but he shall soon be wise :
Thank the Vizier!
This meeting bringeth bloom to cheeks and lips and eyes :
Thank the Vizier!
O my beloved in this blest vault, if I love thee for aye,
Thank the Vizier!
Thine am I, thine ! and learns his soul what it has taught-to die:
Thank the Vizier!
Now, Aswarak divined not her meaning, and was en-
raptured with her, and cried, “Wullahy! so and such thy
love! Thine am I, thine! And what a music is thy voice,
O my mistress ! 'T were a bliss to Eblis in his torment
could he hear it. Life of my head ! and is thy beauty
increased by me? Nay, thou flatterer !” Then he said to
her, “Away with these importunate dogs ! 't is the very
hour of tenderness! Wullahy! they offend my nostril :
stung am I at the sight of them.”
She rejoined, -
O Aswarak ! star of the morn!
Thou that wakenest my beauty from night and scorn,
Thy time is near, and when 't is come,
Long will a jackal how) that this thy request had been dumb.
O Aswarak! star of the morn!

So, the Vizier imaged in his mind the neglect of Mashalleed
from these words, and said, “ Leave the King to my care, O
Queen of Serpents, and expend no portion of thy power on
him; but hasten now the going of these fellows; my heart
is straitened by them, and I, wullahy! would gladly see
a serpent round the necks of either.”
She continued,
O Aswarak! star of the morn!
Lo! the star must die when splendider light is born;
In stronger floods the beam will drown :
Shrink, thon puny orb, and dread to bring me my crown,
O Aswarak! star of the morn!
Then said she, “ Hark awhile at those two! There 's a
disputation between them.”
So, they hearkened, and Ukleet was pledging Boolp, and
passing the cup to him ; but a sullenness had seized the
broker, and he refused it, and Ukleet shouted, “Out, boon-
fellow ! and what a company art thou, that thou refusest the
pledge of friendliness ? Plague on all sulkers !”
And the broker, the old miser, obstinate as are the half-
fuddled, began to mumble, “I came not here to drink, O
Ukleet, but to make a bargain; and my bags be here, and I
like not yonder veil, nor the presence of yonder Vizier, nor
the secresy of this. Now, by the Prophet and that interdict
of his, I'll drink no further.”
And Ukleet said, “ Let her not mark your want of fellow-
ship, or 't will go ill with you. Here be fine wines, spirited
wines ! choice flavours ! and you drink not! Where's the
soul in you, O Boolp, and where 's the life in you, that you
yield her to the Vizier utterly ? Surely she waiteth a gallant
sign from you, so challenge her cheerily.”
Quoth Boolp, “I care not. Shall I leave my wealth and
all I possess void of eyes ļ and she so that I recognise her
not behind the veil ?”.
Ukleet pushed the old miser jeeringly : “You not recognise

her? Oh, Boolp, a pretty dissimulation! Pledge her now a
cup to the snatching of the veil, and bethink you of a fitting
verse, a seemly compliment,—something sugary.”
Then Boolp smoothed his head, and was bothered; and
tapped it, and commenced repeating to Bhanavar:
I saw the moon behind a cloud,
And I was cold as one that's in his shroud :
And I cried, Moon!
Here Ukleet chorused him, “Moon !” and Boolp was
deranged in what he had to say, and gasped, -
Moon! I cried, Moon !—and I cried, Moon!
Then the Vizier and Ukleet laughed till they fell on their
backs; so Bhanavar took up his verse where he left it,
singing,
And to the cry
The Moon made fair the following reply:
Dotard, be still ! for thy desire
Is to embrace the fierce consuming fire.'
; but with good fear that
Then said Boolp, “O my mistress, the laws of conviviality
have till now restrained me; but my coming here was on a
business, and with me my bags, in good faith. So let us
transact this matter of the jewels, and after that the song
of—
Thou and I
A cup will try,'
even as thou wilt.”
Bhanavar threw aside her outer robe and veil, and
appeared in a dress of sumptuous blue, spotted with gold
bees; her face veiled with a veil of gauzy silver, and she
was as the moon in summer heavens, and strode majestically
forward, saying, “The jewels? 't is but one. Behold !"
The lamps were extinguished, and in her hand was the
glory of the Serpent Jewel, no other light save it in the
vaulted chamber.


## p. 77 (#91) ##############################################

THE STORY OF BHANAVAR.
So, the old miser perked his chin and brows, and cried
wondering, “I know it, this Jewel, O my mistress."
She turned to the Vizier, and said, lifting the red gloom
of the Jewel on him, “And thou ?”.
Aswarak ate his under-lip, and answered nothing.
Then she cried, “ There's much ye know in common, ye
two.”
Thereupon Bhanavar passed from the feast on to the
centre of the vault, and stood before the tomb of Almeryl,
and drew the cloth from it; and they saw by the glow of
the Jewel that it was a tomb. When she had mounted
some steps at the side of the tomb, she beckoned them to
come, crying, in a voice of sobs, “ This which is here, like-
wise ye may know.”
So, they came with the coldness of a mystery in their
blood, and looked as she looked intently over the tomb.
The lid was of glass, and through the glass of the lid the
Jewel flung a dark rosy ray on the features of Almeryl lying
beneath it.
Now, the miser was perplexed at the sight; but Aswarak
stepped backward in defiance, bellowing, “'T was for this I
was tricked to come here ! Is 't fooling me a second time ?
By Allah ! look to it; not a second time will Aswarak be
fooled.”
Then she ran to him and exclaimed, “Fooled ? For what
cam'st thou to me?”
And he, foaming and grinding his breath, “Thou woman
of wiles ! O thou serpent ! but I'll be gone from here."
So, she faltered in blandishing sweetness, knowing him
doomed, and loving to dally with him in her wickedness,
“Indeed if thou cam’st not for my kiss—".
Then said the Vizier, “Yet a further guile! Was 't not
an outrage to bring me here?”
She faltered again, leaning the fair length of her limbs on
a couch, “ 'T is ill that we are not alone, else could these
lips convince thee well : else indeed !”


## p. 78 (#92) ##############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And the Vizier cried, “ Chase then these intruders from
us, O thou sorceress, and above all serpents in power ! for
thou poisonest with a touch; and the eye and the ear alike
take in thy poisons greedily. Thou overcomest the senses,
the reason, the judgement; yea vindictiveness, wrath,
suspicions ; leading the soul captive with a breath of thine,
as 't were a breeze from the gardens of bliss.”
Bhanavar changed her manner a little, lisping, “ And why
that starting from the tomb of a dead harmless youth ?
And that abuse of me?"
So, he peered at her inquiringly, echoing “Why??
And she repeated, as a child might repeat it, “Why
that?”
Then the Vizier smote his forehead in the madness of
utter perplexity, changing his eye from Bhanavar to the
tomb of Almeryl, doubting her truth, yet dreading to
disbelieve it. So she saw him fast enmeshed in her
subtleties, and clapped her hands crying, “Come again with
me to the tomb, and note if there be aught I am to blame
in, O Aswarak, and plight thyself to me beside it."
He did nothing save to widen his eye at her somewhat;
and she said, “The two are yonside the tomb, and they hear
us not, and see us not by this light of the Jewel ; so come up
to it boldly with me; free thy mind of its doubt, and for a
reconcilement kiss me on the way.”
Aswarak moved not forward; but as Bhanavar laid the
Jewel in her bosom he tore the veil from her darkened head,
and caught her to him and kissed her. Then Bhanavar laughed
and shouted, “How is it with thee, Vizier Aswarak ?"
He was tottering, and muttered, “ 'T is a death-chill hath
struck me even to my marrow."
So, she drew the Jewel forth once more, and rubbed it
ablaze, and the noise of the Serpents neared; and they streamed
into the vault and under it in fiery jets, surrounding Bhanavar,
and whizzing about her till in their velocity they were indi-
visible; and she stood as a fountain of fire clothed in flashes

of the underworld, the new loveliness of her 'ace growing
vivid violet like an incessant lightning above them. Then
stretched she her two hands, and sang to the Serpents :-
Hither, hither, to the feast !
Hither to the sacrifice !
Virtue for my sake bath ceased :
Now to make an end of Vice!
Twisted-tail and treble-tongue,
Swelling length and greedy maw !
I have had a horrid wrong;
Retribution is the law !
Ye that suck'd my youthful lord,
Now shall make another meal :
Seize the black Vizier abhorr'd;
Seize him! seize him throat and heel!
Set your serpent wits to find
Tortures of a new device :
Have him! have him heart and mind !
Hither to the sacrifice !
Then she whirled with them round and round as a tempest-
whirls; and when she had wound them to a fury, lo, she burst
from the hissing circle and dragged Ukleet from the vault
into the passage, and blocked the entrance to the vault. So
was Queen Bhanavar avenged.
Now, she said to Ukleet, “Ransom presently the broker,--
him they will not harm," and hastened to the King that he
might see her in her beauty. The King reclined on cushions
in the harem with a fair slave-girl, newly from the mountains,
toying with the pearls in her locks. Then thought Bhanavar,
“Let him not slight me !" So she drew a rose-coloured veil
over her face and sat beside Mashalleed. The King continued
his fondling with the girl, saying to her, “Was there no
destiny foretold of thy coming to the palace of the King to
rule it, O Nashta, starbeam in the waters ! and hadst thou no
dream of it?”

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Bhanavar struck the King's arm, but he noticed her not,
and Nashta larighed. Then Bhanavar controlled her trembling
and said, “A word, O King ! and vouchsafe me a hearing."
The King replied languidly, still looking on Nashta, “ 'T is
a command that the voice of none that are crabbed and hideous
be heard in the harem, and I find comfort in it, O Nashta !
but speak thou, my fountain of sweet-dropping lute-notes !”
Bhanavar caught the King's hand and said, “I have to
speak with thee; 't is the Queen. Chase from us this little
wax puppet a space.”
The King disengaged his hand and leaned it over to Nashta,
who began playing with it, and fitting on it a ring, giggling.
Then, as he answered nothing, Bhanavar came nearer and
slapped him on the cheek. Mashalleed started to his feet,
and his hand grasped his girdle ; but that wrathfulness was
stayed when he beheld the veil slide from her visage. So he
cried, “My Queen! my soul !”
She pointed to Nashta, and the King chid the girl, and sent
her forth lean with his shifted displeasure, as a kitten slinks
wet from a fish-pond where it had thought to catch a great
fish. Then Bhanavar exclaimed, “There was a change in thy
manner to me before that creature.”
He sought to dissimulate with her, but at last he con-
fessed, “I was truly this morning the victim of a sorcery."
Thereupon she cried, “ And thou wert angered to find me
not by thee on the couch, but one in my place, a hag of
ugliness. Hear then the case, O Mashalleed ! Surely that
old crone had a dream, and it was that if she slept one night
by the King she would arise fresh in health from her ills, and
with powers lasting a year to heal others of all maladies with
a touch. So she came to me, petitioning me to bring this
about. O my lord the King, did I well in being privy to her
desire ?"
The King could not doubt this story of Bhanavar, seeing
her constant loveliness, and the arch of her flashing brow,
and the oval of her cheek and chin smooth as milk. So

he said, “O my Queen ! I had thought to go, as I must,
gladly; but how shall I go, knowing thy truth, thy beauty
unchanged; thee faithful, a follower of the injunctions of
the Prophet in charitable deeds ?”
Cried she, “And whither goeth my lord, and on what
errand ?”
He answered, “The people of a province southward have
raised the standard of revolt and mocked my authority ; they
have been joined by certain of the Arab chiefs subject to my
dominion, and have defeated my armies. 'T is to subdue
them I go; yea, to crush them. Yet, wullahy! I know not.
Care I if kingdoms fall away, and nations, so that I have
thee? Nay, let all pass, so that thou remain by me.”
Bhanavar paced from him to a mirror, and frowned at the
reflection of her fairness, thinking, “ Such had he spoken to
the girl Nashta, or another, this King !” And she thought,
“I have been beloved by the noblest three on earth ; I will
ask no more of love ; vengeance I have had. 'T is time that
I demand of my beauty nothing save power, and I will make
this King my stepping-stone to power, rejoicing my soul with
the shock of armies."
Now, she persuaded Mashalleed to take her with him on
his expedition against the Arabs; and they set forth, heading
a great assemblage of warriors, south ward to the land
bordering the Desert. The King credited the suggestions of
Bhanavar, that Aswarak had disappeared to join the rebels,
and pressed forward in his eagerness to inflict a chastisement
signal in swiftness upon them and that traitor ; so eagerly
Mashalleed journeyed to his army in advance, that the main
body, with Bhanavar, was left by him long behind. She had
encouraged him, saying, “I shall love thee much if thou art
speedy in winning success." The Queen was housed on an
elephant, harnessed with gold, and with silken purple trap-
pings; from the rose-hued curtains of her palanquin she
looked on a mighty march of warriors, filling the extent of
the plains; all day she fed her sight on them. Surely the

story of her beauty became noised among the guards of her
person that rode and ran beneath the royal elephant, till the
soldiers of Mashalleed spake but of the beauty of the Queen,
and Bhanavar was as a moon shining over that sea of
men.
Now, they had passed the cultivated fields, and were
halting by the ford of a river bordering the Desert, when lo !
a warrior on the yonside, riding in a cloud of dust, and his
shout was, “ The King Mashalleed is defeated, and flying."
Then the Captains of the host witnessed to the greatness of
Allah, and were troubled with a dread, fearing to advance ;
but Bhanavar commanded a horse to be saddled for her, and
mounted it, and plunged through the ford singly; so they
followed her, and all day she rode forward on horseback,
touching neither food nor drink. By night she was a league
beyond the foremost of them, and fell upon the King en-
camped in the Desert, with the loose remnant of his forces.
Mashalleed, when he had looked on her, forgot his affliction,
and stood up to embrace her, but Bhanavar spurned him,
crying, “A time for this in the time of disgrace?” Then
she said, “How came it?”
He answered, “There was a Chief among the enemy, an
Arab, before the terror of whom my people fled.”
Cried she, “Conquer him on the morrow, and till then
I eat not, drink not, sleep not.”
On the morrow Mashalleed again encountered the rebels,
and Bhanavar, seated on her elephant, from a sand-hillock
under a palm, beheld the prowess of the Arab Chief and the
tempest of battle that he was. She thought, “I have seen
but one mighty in combat like that one,–Ruark, the Chief
of the Beni-Asser." Thereupon she coursed toward the
King, even where the arrows gloomed like locusts, thick and
dark in the air aloof, and said, “ The victory is with yonder
Chief! Hurl on him three of thy sons of valour.”
The three were selected, and made onslaught on this
Chief, and perished under his arm.

Bhanavar saw them fall, and exclaimed, “ Another attack
on him, and with thrice three !”
Her will was the mandate of Mashalleed, and these like-
wise were ordered forth, and closed on the Chief, but he
darted from their toils and wheeled about them, spearing
them one by one till the nine were in the dust. Bhanavar
compressed her dry lips and muttered to the King, “Head
thou a body against him."
Mashalleed gathered round his standard the chosen of his
warriors, and smoothed his beard, and headed them. Then
the Chief struck his lance behind him, and stretched rapidly
a half-circle across the sand, and halted on a knoll. When
they neared him he retreated in a further half-circle, and
continued this wise, wasting the fury of Mashalleed, till he
stood among his followers. There, as the King hesitated and
prepared to retreat, he and the others of the tribe levelled
their lances and hung upon his rear, fretting them, slaughter-
ing captains of the troop. When Mashalleed turned to face
his pursuer, the Chief was alone, immovable on his mare,
fronting the ranks. Then Bhanavar taunted the King, and
he essayed the capture of that Chief a second time and a
third, and it was each time as the first. Bhanavar looked
about her with rapid eyes, murmuring, “Oh, what a Chief
is he! Oh that a cloud would fall, a smoke arise, to blind
these hosts, that I might sling my serpents on him unseen,
for I will not be vanquished, though it be by Ruark !” So
she drew to the King, and the altercation between them was
fierce in the fury of the battle, he saying, “'T is a feint of
the Chief, this challenge ; and I must succour the left of my
army by the well, that he is overmatching with numbers ;”
and she, “If thou head them not, then will I, and thou
shalt behold a woman do what thou durst not, and lose her
love and win her scorn." While they spake the Arabs they
looked on seemed to flutter and waver, and the Chief was
backing to them, calling to them as 't were words of shame
to rally them. Seeing this, Mashalleed charged against the

Chief once more, and lo! the Arabs opened to receive him,
closing on his band of warriors like waters whitened by the
storm on a fleet of swift-scudding vessels, and there was a
dust and a tumult visible, such as is seen in the darkness
when a vessel struck by the lightning-bolt is sinking,-flashes
of steel, lifting of hands, rolling of horsemen and horses.
Then Bhanavar groaned aloud, “ They are lost! Shame to
us ! only one hope is left—that 't is Ruark, this Chief !”
Now, the view of the plain cleared, and with it she beheld
the army of Mashalleed broken, the King borne down by a
dust of Arabs; so she unveiled her face and rode on the host
with the horsemen that guarded her, glorious with a crown
of gold and the glowing Jewel on her brow. When she was
a javelin's flight from them the Arabs shouted and paused in
terror, for the light of her head was as the sun setting
between clouds of thunder; but that Chief dashed forward
like a flame beaten level by the wind, crying, " Bhanavar;
Bhanavar !" and she knew the features of Ruark ; so she
said, “Even I!” And he cried again, “Bhanavar! Bhanavar!"
and was as one stricken by a shaft of magic. Then Bhanavar
threw on him certain of the horsemen with her, and he
suffered them without a sign to surround him and grasp his
mare by the bridle-rein, and bring him, disarmed, before the
Queen. At sight of Ruark a captive the Arabs fell into
confusion, and lost heart, and were speedily chased and
scattered from the scene like a loose spray before the wind ;
but Mashalleed the King rejoiced mightily and praised
Bhanavar, and the whole army of the King praised her,
magnifying her.
Now, with Ruark she interchanged no syllable, and said
not farewell to him when she departed with Mashalleed, to
encounter other tribes; and the Chief was bound and con-
ducted a prisoner to the city of the inland sea, and cast into
prison, in expectation of Death the releaser, and continued
there wellnigh a year, eating the bitter bread of captivity.
In the evening of every seventh day there came to him a
Mashalie the scene like a loose e speedily chased and

little mountain girl, that sat by him and leaned a lute to her
bosom, singing of the mountain and the desert, but he
tumed his face from her to the wall. One day she sang of
Death the releaser, and Ruark thought, “'T is come ! she
warneth me! Merciful is Allah !” On the morning that
followed Ukleet entered the cell, and with him three slaves,
blacks, armed with scimitars. So Ruark stood up and bore
witness to his faith, saying, “Swift with the stroke !” but
Ukleet exclaimed, “ Fear not! the end is not yet.”
Then said he, “Peace with thee! These slaves, O Chief,
excelling in martial qualities ! surely they're my retinue, and
the retinue of them of my rank in the palace; and where I
go they go ; for the exalted have more shadows than one !
yea, three have they in my case, even very grimly black
shadows, whereon the idle expend not laughter, and whoso
joketh in their hearing, 't is, wullahy! the last joke of that
person. In such-wise are the powerful known among men,
they that stand very prominent in the beams of prosperity !
Now this of myself; but for thee-of a surety the Queen
Bhanavar, my mistress, will be here by the time of the
rising of the moon. In the name of Allah !” Saying that
he departed in his greatness, and Ruark watched for her
that rose in his soul as the moon in the heavens.
Meanwhile Bhanavar had mused, “ 'T is this day, the day
when the Serpents desire their due, and the King
Mashalleed they shall have ; for what is life to him but a
treachery and a dalliance, and what is my hold on him but
this Jewel of the Serpents { He has had the profit of
beauty, and he shall yield the penalty : my kiss is for him,
my serpent-kiss. And I will release Ruark, and espouse
hin, and war with kings, sultans, emperors, infidels,
subduing them till they worship me.”
She flashed her figure in the glass, and was lovely therein
as one in the light of Paradise ; but ere she reached the
King Mashalleed, lo ! the hour of the Serpents had struck,
and her beauty melted from her as snow melts from off the

rock; and she was suddenly haggard in utter uncomeliness,
and knew it not, but marched, smiling a grand smile, on to
the King. Now as Mashalleed lifted his eyes to her he
started amazed, crying, “ The hag again !” and she said,
“What of the hag, O my lord the King ?” Thereat he was
yet more amazed, and exclaimed, “The hag of ugliness with
the voice of Bhanavar! Has then the Queen lent that
loathsomeness her voice also ?”
Bhanavar chilled a moment, and looked on the faces of the
women present, and they were staring at her, the younger
ones tittering, and among them Nashta, whom she hated.
So she cried, “ Away with ye !” But the King commanded
them, “Stay !” Then the Queen leaned to him, saying, “I
will speak with my lord alone;" whereat he shrank from
her, and spat. Ice and flame shivered through the blood of
Bhanavar, yet such was her eagerness to give the kiss to
Mashalleed, that she leaned to him, still wooing him to her
with smiles. Then the King seized her violently, and flung
her over the marble floor to the very basin of the fountain,
and the crown that was on her brow fell and rolled to the
feet of Nashta. The girl lifted it, laughing, and was in the
act of fitting it to her fair head amid the chuckles of her
companions, when a slap from the hand of Bhanavar spun
her twice round, and she dropped to the marble insensible.
The King bellowed in wrath, and ran to Nashta, crying to
the Queen, “Surrender that crown to her, foul hag !” But
Bhanavar had bent over the basin of the fountain, and
beheld the image of her change therein, and was hurrying
from the hall and down the corridors of the palace to the
private chamber. So he made bare the steel by his side,
and followed her with a number of the harem guard,
menacing her, and commanding her to surrender the crown
with the Jewel. Ere she could lay hand on a veil, he was
beside her, and she was encompassed. In that extremity
Bhanavar plucked the Jewel from her crown, and rubbed it,
calling the Serpents to her. One came, one only, and that

one would not move from her to sling himself about the neck
of Mashalleed, but whirled round her, hissing :
Every hour a serpent dies,
Till we have the sacrifice :
Sweeten, sweeten, with thy kiss,
Quick! a soul for Karatis.
Surely the King bit his breath, marvelling, and his fury
became an awful fear, and he fell back from her, molesting
her no further. Then she squeezed the serpent till his body
writhed in knots, and veiled herself, and sprang down a
secret passage to the garden, and it was the time of the
rising of the moon. Coolness and soothingness dropped on
lier as a balm from the great light, and she gazed on it
niurmuring, as in a memory :
Shall I counsel the moon in her ascending ?
Stay under that dark palm-tree through the night,
Rest on the mountain slope,
By the couching antelope,
O thou enthroned supremacy of light!
And for ever the lustre thou art lending
Lean on the fair long brook that leaps and leaps,
Silvery leaps and falls :
Hang by the mountain-walls,
Moon ! and arise no more to crown the steeps,
For a danger and dolour is thy wending!
And she panted and sighed, and wept, crying, “Who,
who will kiss me or have my kiss now, that I may indeed
be as yonder beam? Who, that I may be avenged on this
King? And who sang that song of the ascending of the
moon, that comes to me as a part of me from old times ?”
As she gazed on the circled radiance swimming under a plume
of palm leaves, she exclaimed, “Ruark ! Ruark the Chief !”
So she clasped her hands to her bosom, and crouched under
the shadows of the garden, and fled through the garden gates
and the streets of the city, heavily veiled, to the prison
where Ruark awaited her within the walls and Ukleet

without. The Governor of the prison had been warned by
Ukleet of her coming, and the doors and bars opened before
her unchallenged, till she stood in the cell of Ruark ; her
eyes, that were alone unveiled, scanned the countenance of
the Chief, the fevered lustre-jet of his looks, and by the
little moonlight in the cell she saw with a glance the straw-
heap and the fetters, and the black-bread and water untasted
on the bench,-signs of his misery and desire for her coming.
So she greeted him with the word of peace, and he replied
with the name of the All-Merciful. Then said she, “O
Ruark, of Rukrooth thy mother tell me somewhat.”
He answered, “I know nought of her since that day.
Allah have her in his keeping !”
So, she cried, “ How? What say'st thou, Ruark ; 't is a
riddle."
Then he, “ The oath of Ruark is no rope of sand! He
swore to see her not till he had set eyes on Bhanavar."
She knelt by the Chief, saying in a soft voice, “ Very
greatly the Chief of the Beni-Asser loved Bhanavar.” And
she thought, “ Yea! greatly and verily love I him; and he
shall be no victim of the Serpents, for I 'll defy them and
give them other prey.” So she said in deeper notes, “Ruark !
the Queen is come hither to release thee. O my Chief ! 0
thou soul of wrath! Ruark, my fire-eye ! my eagle of the
desert! where is one on earth beloved as thou art by Bhan-
avar ?" The dark light in his eyes kindled as light in the
eyes of a lion, and she continued, “Ruark, what a yoke is
hers who weareth this crown! He that is my lord, how am
I mated to him save in loathing? O my Chief, my lion !
hadst thou no dream of Bhanavar, that she would come
hither to unbind thee and lift thee beside her, and live with
thee in love and veilless loveliness,—thine? Yea! and in
power over lands and nations and armies, lording the Infidel,
taming them to submission, exulting in defiance and assaults
and victories and magnanimities—thou and she ?" Then
while his breast heaved like a broad wave, the Queen

started to her feet, crying, “Lo, she is here ! and this she
offereth thee, Ruark !”
A shrill cry parted from her lips, and to the clapping of
her hands slaves entered the cell with lamps, and instruments
to strike off the fetters from the Chief; and they released
him, and Ruark leaned on their shoulders to bear the weight
of a limb, so was he weakened by captivity; but Bhanavar
thrust them from the Chief, and took the pressure of his
elbow on her own shoulder, and walked with him thus to the
door of the cell, he sighing as one in a dream that dreameth
the bliss of bliss. Now they had gone three paces onward,
and were in the light of many lamps, when behold! the veil
of Bhanavar caught in the sleeve of Ruark as he lifted it, and
her visage became bare. She shrieked, and caught up her
two hands to her brow, but the slaves had a glimpse of her,
and said among themselves, “This is not the Queen.” And
they murmured, “'T is an impostor ! one in league with the
Chief.” Bhanavar heard them say, “ Arrest her with him at
the Governor's gate," and summoned her soul, thinking, “He
loveth me, the Chief! he will look into my eyes and mark
not the change. What need I then to dread his scorn when
I ask of him the kiss : now must it be given, or we are lost,
both of us !” and she raised her head on Ruark, and said to
him, “O my Chief, ere we leave these walls and join our
fates, wilt thou plight thyself to me with a kiss ?”
Ruark leapt to her like the bounding leopard, and gave
her the kiss, as were it his whole soul he gave. Then in
a moment Bhanavar felt the blush of beauty burn over her,
and drew the veil down on her face, and suffered the slaves
to arrest her with Ruark, and bring her before the Governor,
and from the Governor to the King in his council-chamber,
with the Chief of the Beni-Asser.
Now, the King Mashalleed called to her, “Thou traitress !
thou sorceress ! thou serpent !”.
And she answered under the veil, “ What, O my lord the
King! and wherefore these evil names of me?”

Cried he, “Thou thing of guile! and thou hast pleaded
with me for the life of the Chief thus long to visit him
in secret! Life of my head ! but Mashalleed is not one to
be fooled.”
So, she said, “'T is Bhanavar ! hast thou forgotten her ? .”.
Then he waxed white with rage, exclaiming, “ Yea, 't.
is she! a serpent in the slough! and Ukleet in the torture
hath told of thee what is known to him. Unveil ! unveil !”
She threw the veil from her figure, and smiled, for
Mashalleed was mute, the torrent of invective frozen on his
mouth when he beheld the miracle of beauty that she was,
the splendid jewel of throbbing loveliness. So to scourge
him with the bitter lash of jealousy, Bhanavar turned her
eyes on Ruark, and said sweetly, “Yet shalt thou live to
taste again the bliss of the Desert. Pleasant was our time
in it, O my Chief !” The King glared and choked, and she
said again, “Nor he conquered thee, but I; and I that
conquered thee, little will it be for me to conquer him : his
threats are the winds of idleness.”
Surely the world darkened before the eyes of Mashalleed,
and he arose and called to his guard hoarsely, “Have off
their heads !” They hesitated, dreading the Queen, and he
roared, “Slay them !”
Bhanavar beheld the winking of the steel, but ere the
scimitars descended, she seized Ruark, and they stood in
a whizzing ring of serpents, the sound of whom was as the
hum of a thousand wires struck by storm-winds. Then she
glowed, towering over them with the Chief clasped to her,
and crying :
King of vileness ! match thy slaves
With my creatures of the caves.
And she sang to the Serpents :
Seize upon him ! sting him thro'!
Thrice this day shall pay your due.
Instead of obeying her injunction, they made narrower

their circle round Bhanavar and the Chief. She yellowed,
and took hold of the nearest Serpent horribly, crying :
Dare against me to rebel,
Ye, the bitter brood of hell ?
And the Serpent gasped in reply:
One the kiss to us secures :
Give us ours, and we are yours.
Thereupon another of the Serpents swung round the feet of
Ruark, winding his length upward round the body of the
Chief; so she tugged at that one, tearing it from him violently,
and crying:
Him ye shall not have, I swear!
Seize the King that's crouching there.
And that Serpent hissed :
This is he the kiss ensures :
Give us ours, and we are yours.
Another and another Serpent she flung from the Chief, and
they began to swarm venomously, answering her no more.
Then Ruark bore witness to his faith, and folded his arms
with the grave smile she had known in the desert; and
Bhanavar struggled and tussled with the Serpents in fierceness,
strangling and tossing them to right and left. “Great is
Allah !" cried all present, and the King trembled, for never
was sight like that seen, the hall flashing with the serpents,
and a woman-serpent, their Queen, raging to save one from
their fury, shrieking at intervals :
Never, never shall ye fold,
Save with me the man I hold.
But now the hiss and scream of the Serpents and the noise
of their circling was quickened to a slurred savage sound and
they closed on Ruark, and she felt him stifling and that they
were relentless. So in the height of the tempest Bhanavar

seized the Jewel in the gold circlet on her brow and cast it from
her. Lo ! the Serpents instantly abated their frenzy, and flew
all of them to pluck the Jewel, chasing the one that had it in
his fangs through the casement, and the hall breathed empty
of them. Then in the silence that was, Bhanavar veiled her
face and said to the Chief, “ Pass from the hall while they yet
dread me. No longer am I Queen of Serpents.”
But he replied, “Nay! said I not my soul is thine ?”
She cried to him, “Seest thou not the change in me? I was
bound to those Serpents for my beauty, and 't is gone! Now
am I powerless, hateful to look on, O Ruark my Chief!"
He remained still, saying, “ What thou hast been thou art."
She exclaimed, “O true soul, the light is hateful to me as I
to the light; but I will yet save thee to comfort Rukrooth, thy
mother.”
So, she drew him with her swiftly from the hall of the King
ere the King had recovered his voice of command; but now
the wrath of the All-powerful was upon her and him! Surely
within an hour from the flight of the Serpents, the slaves and
soldiers of Mashalleed laid at his feet two heads that were the
heads of Ruark and Bhanavar; and they said, “O great King,
we tracked them to her chamber and through to a passage and
a vault hung with black, wherein were two corpses, one in a
tomb and one unburied, and we slew them there, clasping each
other, O King of the age !”
Mashalleed gazed upon the head of Bhanavar and sighed,
for death had made the head again fair with a wondrous beauty,
a loveliness never before seen on earth.

THE BETROTHAL.
Now, when Shibli Bagarag had ceased speaking, the Vizier
smiled gravely, and shook his beard with satisfaction, and
said to the Eclipser of Reason, “ What opinest thou of this
nephew of the barber, O Noorna bin Noorka?"
She answered, “O Feshnavat, my father, truly I am con-
tent with the bargain of my betrothal. He, Wullahy, is a
fair youth of flowing speech.” Then she said, “ Ask thou
him what he opineth of me, his betrothed ?”
So, the Vizier put that interrogation to Shibli Bagarag, and
the youth was in perplexity; thinking, “Is it possible to be
joyful in the embrace of one that hath brought thwackings
upon us, serious blows ?” Thinking, “Yet hath she, when
the mood cometh, kindly looks; and I marked her eye
dwelling on me admiringly!” And he thought, “ Mayhap
she that groweth younger and counteth nature backwards,
hath a history that would affect me ; or, it may be, my
kisses—wah ! I like not to give them, and it is said,
'Love is wither'd by the wither'd lip;'
and that,
‘On bones become too prominent he'll trip.'
Yet put the case, that my kisses—I shower them not, Allah
the all-seeing is my witness ! and they be given daintily as
't were to the leaf of a nettle, or over-hot pilau. Yet haply
kisses repeated might restore her to a bloom, and it is certain

youth is somehow stolen from her, if the Vizier Feshnavat
went before her, and his blood be her blood ; and he is
powerful, she wise. I'll decide to act the part of a rejoicer,
and express of her opinions honeyed to the soul of that
sex.”
Now, while he was thus debating he hung his head, and
the Vizier awaited his response, knitting his brows angrily
at the delay, and at the last he cried, “ What! no answer ?
how's this ? Shall thy like dare hold debate when questioned
of my like? And is my daughter Noorna bin Noorka,
thinkest thou, a slave-girl in the market,—thou haggling at
her price, O thou nephew of the barber?”
So, Shibli Bagarag exclaimed, “O exalted one, bestower
of the bride ! surely I debated with myself but for appro-
priate terms; and I delayed to select the metre of the verse
fitting my thoughts of her, and my wondrous good fortune,
and the honour done me.”
Then the Vizier, “ Let us hear : we listen.”
And Shibli Bagarag was advised to deal with illustrations
in his dilemma, by-ways of expression, and spake in extem-
poraneous verse, and with a full voice :
The pupils of the Sage for living Beauty sought;
And one a Vision clasped, and one a Model wrought.
“I have it !” each exclaimed, and rivalry arose :
" Paint me thy Maid of air !” “ Thy Grace of clay disclose.”
“What ! limbs that cannot move !” “What! lips that melt away!”
“Keep thou thy Maid of air !” “Shroud up thy Grace of clay!”
'T was thus, contending hot, they went before the Sage,
And knelt at the wise wells of cold ascetic age.
“ The fairest of the twain, O father, thou record :"
He answered, “Fairest she who's likest to her lord.”
Said they, “ What fairer thing matched with them might prevail ? "
The Sage austerely smiled, and said, “ Yon monkey's tail.”
'T is left for after-time his wisdom to declare :
That's loveliest we best love, and to ourselves compare.
Yet lovelier than all hands shape or fancies build,
The meanest thing of earth God with his fire hath filled.

Now, when Shibli Bagarag ceased, Noorna bin Noorka
cried, “Enough, 0 wondrous turner of verse, thou that art
honest !” And she laughed loudly, rustling like a bag of
shavings, and rolling in her laughter.
Then said she, “O my betrothed, is not the thing thou
wouldst say no other than-
'Each to his mind doth the fairest enfold,
For broken long since was Beauty's mould ;
and, “Thou that art old, withered, I cannot flatter thee, as I
can in no way pay compliments to the monkey's tail of high
design ; nevertheless the Sage would do thee honour?' So
read I thy illustration, O keen of wit ! and thou art forgiven
its boldness, my betrothed,–Wullahy! utterly so."
Now, the youth was abashed at her discernment, and the
kindliness of her manner won him to say:
There's many a flower of sweetness, there's many a gem of earth
Would thrill with bliss our being, could we perceive its worth.
O beauteous is creation, in fashion and device!
If I have fail'd to think thee fair, 't is blindness is my vice.
And she answered him :
I've proved thy wit and power of verse,
That is at will diffuse and terse :
Lest thou commence to lie-be dumb!
I am content: the time will come!
Then she said to the Vizier Feshnavat, “O my father,
there is all in this youth, the nephew of the barber, that's
desireable for the undertaking; and his feet will be on a level
with the task we propose for him, he the height of man
above it. 'T is clear that vanity will trip him, but honesty
is a strong upholder; and he is one that hath the spirit
of enterprise and the mask of dissimulation : gratitude I
observe in him; and it is as I thought when I came upon
him on the sand-hill outside the city, that his star is clearly in
a web with our star, he destined for the Shaving of Shagpat.”

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So, the Vizier replied, “He hath had thwackings, yet is
he not deterred from making further attempt on Shagpat. I
think well of him, and I augur hopefully. Wullahy! the
Cadi shall be sent for; I can sleep in his secresy; and he
shall perform the ceremonies of betrothal, even now and
where we sit, and it shall be for him to write the terms
of contract: so shall we bind the youth firmly to us, and he
will be one of us as we are, devoted to the undertaking by
three bonds—the bond of vengeance, the bond of ambition,
and that of love."
Now, so it was that the Vizier despatched a summons for
the attendance of the Cadi, and he came and performed
between Shibli Bagarag and Noorna bin Noorka ceremonies
of betrothal, and wrote terms of contract; and they were
witnessed duly by the legal number of witnesses, and so
worded that he had no claim on her as wife till such time as
the Event to which he bound himself was mastered. Then
the fees being paid, and compliments interchanged, the
Vizier exclaimed, “Be ye happy! and let the weak cling to
the strong; and be ye two to one in this world, and no
split halves that betray division and stick not together when
the gum is heated.” Then he made a sign to the Cadi and
them that had witnessed the contract to follow him, leaving
the betrothed ones to their own company.
So, when they were alone Noorna gazed on the youth
wistfully, and said in a soft tone, “ Thou art dazed with the
adventure, O youth! Surely there is one kiss owing me:
art thou willing? Am I reduced to beg it of thee? Or
dream’st thou?"
He lifted his head and replied, “Even so."
Thereat he stood up languidly, and went to her and kissed
her. And she smiled and said, “I wot it will be otherwise,
and thou wilt learn swiftness of limb, brightness of eye, and
the longing for earthly beatitude, when next I ask thee,
O my betrothed !”
Lo! while she spake, new light seemed in her; and it

was as if a splendid jewel were struggling to cast its beams
through the sides of a crystal vase smeared with dust and
old dirt and spinnings of the damp spider. He was amazed,
and cried, “How's this? What change is passing in
thee?”
She said, “ Joy in thy kiss, and that I have 'scaped
Shagpat.”
Then he: “Shagpat? How? had that wretch claim over
thee ere I came ?”
But she looked fearfully at the corners of the room and
exclaimed, “Hush, my betrothed ! speak not of him in that
fashion, 't is dangerous; and my power cannot keep off his
emissaries at all times.” Then she said, “O my betrothed,
know me a sorceress ensorcelled ; not that I seem, but that I
shall be! Wait thou for the time and it will reward thee.
What! thou think'st to have plucked a wrinkled o'erripe
fruit,-a mouldy pomegranate under the branches, a sour
tamarind ? 'T is well! I say nought, save that time will
come, and be thou content. It is truly as I said, that I have
thee between me and Shagpat; and that honoured one of
this city thought fit in his presumption to demand me in
marriage at the hands of my father, knowing me wise, and
knowing the thing that transformed me to this, the abomin-
able fellow ! Surely my father entertained not his proposal
save with scorn ; but the King looked favourably on it, and
it is even now matter of reproach to Feshnavat, my father,
that he withholdeth me from Shagpat.”
Quoth Shibli Bagarag, “ A clothier, 0 Noorna, control the
Vizier ! and demand of him his daughter in marriage ! and a
clothier influence the King against his Vizier!—'t is, wullahy!
a riddle.”
She replied, “'T is even so, eyes of mine, my betrothed !
but thou know'st not Shagpat, and that he is. Lo! the
King, and all of this city save we three, are held in enchant-
ment by him, and made foolish by one hair that's in his
head.”


## p. 98 (#112) #############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Shibli Bagarag started in his seat like one that shineth
with a discovery, and cried, “The Identical !”
Then she, sighing, “'T is that indeed ! but the Identical
of Identicals, the chief and head of them, and I, woe's me!
I, the planter of it."
So he said, “How so ?."
But she cried, “I'll tell thee not here, nor aught of myself
and him, and the Genie held in bondage by me, till thou art
proved by adventure, and we float peacefully on the sea of
the Bright Lily : there shalt thou see me as I am, and hear
my story, and marvel at it; for 't is wondrous, and a mani-
festation of the Power that dwelleth unseen.”
So, Shibli Bagarag pondered awhile on the strange nature
of the things she hinted, and laughter seized him as he
reflected on Shagpat, and the whole city enchanted by one
hair in his head ; and he exclaimed, “O Noorna, knoweth
he, Shagpat, of the might in him ?”
She answered, “ Enough for his vain soul that homage is
paid to him, and he careth not for the wherefore ! ”
Shibli Bagarag fixed his eyes on the deep-flowered carpets
of the floor, as if reading there a matter quaintly written, and
smiled, saying, “What boldness was mine—the making
offer to shear Shagpat, the lion in his lair, he that holdeth a
whole city in enchantment! Wah! 't was an instance of
daring !"
And Noorna said, “Not only an entire city, but other
cities affected by him, as witness Oolb, whither thou wilt
go; and there be governments and states, and conditions of
men remote, that hang upon him, Shagpat. 'T is even so;
I swell not his size. When thou hast mastered the Event,
and sent him forth shivering from thy blade like the shorn
lamb, 't will be known how great a thing has been achieved,
and a record for the generations to come; choice is that
historian destined to record it !”
Quoth he, looking eagerly at her, “O Noorna, what is it
in thy speech affecteth me? Surely it infuseth the vigour of

rise ofat, was large anio ved in its haus I was
wine, old wine ; and I shiver with desire to shave Shagpat,
and spin threads for the historian to weave in order. I,
wullahy! had but dry visions of the greatness destined for
me till now, my betrothed! Shall I master an Event in
shaving him, and be told of to future ages { By Allah and
his Prophet (praise be to that name !), this is greatness ! Say,
Noorna, hadst thou foreknowledge of me and my coming to
this city ?”
So, she said, "I was on the roofs one night among the
stars ere moonrise, O my betrothed, and 't was close on the
rise of this very month's moon. The star of our enemy,
Shagpat, was large and red, mine as it were menaced by its
proximity, nigh swallowed in its haughty beams and the
steady overbearings of its effulgence. 'Twas so as it had
long been, when suddenly, lo! a star from the upper
heaven that shot down between them wildly, and my star
took lustre from it; and the star of Shagpat trembled like
a ring on a tightened rope, and waved and flickered, and
seemed to come forward and to retire; and 't was presently
as a comet in the sky, bright,-a tadpole, with large head
and lengthy tail, in the assembly of the planets. This saw
I: and that the stranger star was stationed by my star,
shielding it, and that it drew nearer to my star, and entered
its circle, and that the two stars seemed mixing the
splendour that was theirs. Now, that sight amazed me, and
my heart in its beating quickened with the expectation of
things approaching. Surely I rendered praise, and pressed
both hands on my bosom, and watched, and behold! the
comet, the illumined tadpole, was becoming restless beneath
the joint rays of the twain that were dominating him; and
he diminished, and lashed his tail uneasily, half madly,
darting as do captured beasts from the fetters that constrain
them. Then went there from thy star—for I know now't
was thine-a momentary flash across the head of the tadpole,
and again another and another, rapidly, pertinaciously.
And from thy star there passed repeated flashes across the

head of the tadpole, till his brilliance was as 't were severed
from him, and he, like drossy silver, a dead shape in the
conspicuous heavens. And he became yellow as the rolling
eyes of sick wretches in pain, and shrank in his place like
pale parchment at the touch of flame; dull was he as an
animal fascinated by fear, and deprived of all power to make
head against the foe, darkness, that now beset him, and
usurped part of his yet lively tail, and settled on his head,
and coated part of his body. So when this tadpole, that
was once terrible to me, became turbaned, shoed, and
shawled with darkness, and there was little of him remaining
visible, lo ! a concluding flash shot from thy star, and he fell
heavily down the sky and below the hills, into the sea, that
is, the Enchanted Sea, whose Queen is Rabesqurat,
Mistress of Illusions. Now when my soul recovered from
amazement at the marvels seen, I arose and went from the
starry roofs to consult my books of magic, and 't was
revealed to me that one was wandering to a junction with
my destiny, and that by his means the great aim would of a
surety be accomplished-Shagpat Shaved ! So my purpose
was to discover him; and I made calculations, and
summoned them that serve me to search for such a youth as
thou art; fairly, O my betrothed, did I preconceive thee.
And so it was that I traced a magic line from the sand-hills
to the city, and from the outer hills to the sand-hills; and
whoso approached by that line I knew was he marked out
as my champion, my betrothed, —a youth destined for great
things. Was I right? The egg hatcheth. Thou art
already proved by thwackings, seasoned to the undertaking,
and I doubt not thou art he that will finish with that
tadpole Shagpat, and sit in the high seat, thy name an odour
in distant lands, a joy to the historian, the Compiler of
Events, thou Master of an Event, and of the greatest which
time will witness for ages to come.”
When she had spoken Shibli Bagarag considered her

words, and the knowledge that he was selected by destiny
as Master of an Event inflated him; and he was a hawk in
eagerness, a peacock in pride, an ostrich in fulness of chest,
crying, “O Noorna bin Noorka! is 't really so ? Truly it
must be, for the readers of planets were also busy with me
at the time of my birth, interpreting of me in excessive
agitation ; and the thing they foretold is as thou foretellest.
I am, wullahy! marked: I walk manifest in the eye of
Providence.”
Thereupon he exulted, and his mind strutted through the
future of his days, and down the ladder of all time, exacting
homage from men, his brethren ; and 't was beyond the art of
Noorna to fix him to the present duties of the enterprise : he
was as feathered seed before the breath of vanity.
Now, while the twain discoursed, she of the preparations
for shaving Shagpat, he of his completion of the deed, and
the honours due to him as Master of the Event, Feshnavat
the Vizier returned to them from his entertainment of the
Cadi; and he had bribed him to silence with a mighty bribe.
So he called to them-
“Ho! be ye ready to commence the work ? and have ye
advised together as to the beginning? True is that triplet:
Whatever enterprize man bath,
For waking love or curbing wrath,
'T is the first step that makes a path.'
And how have ye determined as to that first step?"
Noorna replied, “O my father! we have not decided, and
there hath been yet no deliberation between us as to that.”
Then he said, “ All this while have ye talked, and no
deliberation as to that! Lo, I have drawn the Cadi to our
plot, and bribed him with a mighty bribe ; and I have pre-
pared possible dis, uises for this nephew of the barber; and
I have had the witnesses of thy betrothal despatched to
foreign parts, far kingdoms in the land of Roum, to prevent

Builder £—a punishment that, by Allah!”
So, Shibli Pagarag said, “How of that punishment, O
Vizier ? "

AND THIS IS THE PUNISHMENT OF
SHAHPESH, THE PERSIAN, ON
KHIPIL, THE BUILDER.
They relate that Shahpesh, the Persian, commanded the
building of a palace, and Khipil was his builder. The work
lingered from the first year of the reign of Shahpesh even to
his fourteenth. One day Shahpesh went to the river-side
where it stood, to inspect it. Khipil was sitting on a marble
slab among the stones and blocks; round him stretched
lazily the masons and stonecutters and slaves of burden;
and they with the curve of humorous enjoyment on their
lips, for he was reciting to them adventures, interspersed
with anecdotes and recitations and poetic instances, as was
his wont. They were like pleased flocks whom the shepherd
hath led to a pasture freshened with brooks, there to feed
indolently; he, the shepherd, in the midst.
Now, the King said to him, “O Khipil, show me my
palace where it standeth, for I desire to gratify my sight
with its fairness."
Khipil abased himself before Shahpesh, and answered,
“ 'T is even here, O King of the age, where thou delightest
the earth with thy foot and the ear of thy slave with sweet-
ness. Surely a site of vantage, one that dominateth earth,
air, and water, which is the builder's first and chief requi-
sition for a noble palace, a palace to fill foreign kings and

sultans with the distraction of envy ; and it is, 0 Sovereign
of the time, a site, this site I have chosen, to occupy the
tongues of travellers and awaken the flights of poets !"
Shahpesh smiled and said, “The site is good ! I laud the
site! Likewise I laud the wisdom of Ebn Busrac, where he
exclaims :
* Be sure, where Virtue faileth to appear,
For her a gorgeous mansion men will rear;
And day and night her praises will be heard,
Where never yet she spake a single word.'”
Then said he, "O Khipil, my builder, there was once a farm-
servant that, having neglected in the seed-time to sow, took to
singing the richness of his soil when it was harvest, in proof
of which he displayed the abundance of weeds that coloured
the land everywhere. Discover to me now the completeness
of my halls and apartments, I pray thee, O Khipil, and be the
excellence of thy construction made visible to me!”
Quoth Khipil, “To hear is to obey."
He conducted Shahpesh among the unfinished saloons and
imperfect courts and roofless rooms, and by half-erected obelisks,
and columns pierced and chipped, of the palace of his building.
And he was bewildered at the words spoken by Shahpesh;
but now the King exalted him, and admired the perfection
of his craft, the greatness of his labour, the speediness of his
construction, his assiduity; feigning not to behold his
negligence.
Presently they went up winding balusters to a marble terrace,
and the King said, “Such is thy devotion and constancy in
toil, O Khipil, that thou shalt walk before me here."
He then commanded Khipil to precede him, and Khipil was
heightened with the honour. When Khipil had paraded a
short space he stopped quickly, and said to Shahpesh, “ Here
is, as it chanceth, a gap, 0 King ! and we can go no further
this way.”
Shahpesh said, “ All is perfect, and it is my will thou
delay not to advance.”

THE PUNISHMENT OF KHIPIL.

. Khipil cried, “The gap is wide, O mighty King, and mani-
fest, and it is the one incomplete part of thy palace."
Then said Shahpesh, “O Khipil, I see no distinction be-
tween one part and another; excellent are all parts in beauty
and proportion, and there can be no part incomplete in this
palace that occupieth the builder fourteen years in its build-
ing: so advance, and do my bidding."
Khipil yet hesitated, for the gap was of many strides, and
at the bottom of the gap was a deep water, and he one that
knew not the motion of swimming. But Shahpesh ordered
his guard to point their arrows in the direction of Khipil, and
Khipil stepped forward hurriedly, and fell in the gap, and
was swallowed by the water below. When he rose the second
time, succour reached him, and he was drawn to land trem-
bling, his teeth chattering. And Shahpesh praised him, and
said, “This is an apt contrivance for a bath, Khipil O my
builder ! well conceived; one that taketh by surprise; and it
shall be thy reward daily when much talking hath fatigued
thee.”
Then he bade Khipil lead him to the hall of state. And
when they were there Shahpesh said, “For a privilege, and as
a mark of my approbation, I give thee permission to sit in the
marble chair of yonder throne, even in my presence, O Khipil.”
Khipil said, “Surely, 0 King, the chair is not yet
executed.”
And Shahpesh exclaimed, “If this be so, thou art but the
length of thy measure on the ground, () talkative one!”
Khipil said, “Nay, 't is not so, O King of splendours! blind
that I am ! yonder 's indeed the chair.”
And Khipil feared the King, and went to the place where
the chair should be, and bent his body in a sitting posture,
eyeing the King, and made pretence to sit in the chair of
Shahpesh, as in conspiracy to amuse his master.
Then said Shahpesh, “For a token that I approve thy exe-
cution of the chair, thou shalt be honoured by remaining seated
in it one day and one night; but move thou to the right or

to the left, showing thy soul insensible of the honour done
thee, transfixed thou shalt be with twenty arrows and five."
The King then left him with a guard of twenty-five of his
body-guard ; and they stood around him with bent bows, so
that Khipil dared not move from his sitting posture. And
the masons and the people crowded to see Khipil sitting on
his master's chair, for it became rumoured about. When
they beheld him sitting upon nothing, and he trembling to
stir for fear of the loosening of the arrows, they laughed
so that they rolled upon the floor of the hall, and the echoes
of laughter were a thousandfold. Surely the arrows of the
guards swayed with the laughter that shook them.
Now, when the time had expired for his sitting in the
chair, Shahpesh returned to him, and he was cramped,
pitiable to see ; and Shahpesh said, “ Thou hast been
exalted above men, O Khipil ! for that thou didst execute
for thy master has been found fitting for thee.”
Then he bade Khipil lead the way to the noble gardens of
dalliance and pleasure that he had planted and contrived.
And Khipil went in that state described by the poet, when
we go draggingly, with remonstrating members,
Knowing a dreadful strength behind,
And a dark fate before.
They came to the gardens, and behold, these were full of
weeds and nettles, the fountains dry, no tree to be seen—a
desert And Shahpesh cried, “This is indeed of admirable
design, O Khipil! Feelest thou not the coolness of the
fountains £—their refreshingness ? Truly I am grateful to
thee! And these flowers, pluck me now a handful, and tell
me of their perfume.”
Khipil plucked a handful of the nettles that were there in
the place of flowers, and put his nose to them before Shah-
pesh, till his nose was reddened ; and desire to rub it waxed
in him, and possessed him, and became a passion, so that he
could scarce refrain from rubbing it even in the King's

107
presence. And the King encouraged him to sniff and enjoy
their fragrance, repeating the poet's words :
Methinks I am a lover and a child,
A little child and happy lover, both!
When by the breath of flowers I am beguiled
From sense of pain, and lulled in odorous sloth.
So I adore them, that no mistress sweet
Seems worthier of the love which they awake :
In innocence and beauty more complete,
Was never maiden cheek in morning lake.
Oh, while I live, surround me with fresh flowers !
Oh, when I die, then bury me in their bowers !
And the King said, “ What sayest thou, O my builder ?
that is a fair quotation, applicable to thy feelings, one that
expresseth them ?”
Khipil answered, “ 'T is eloquent, O great King ! compre-
hensiveness would be its portion, but that it alludeth not to
the delight of chafing."
Then Shahpesh laughed, and cried, “ Chafe not! it is an
ill thing and a hideous ! This nosegay, O Khipil, it is for
thee to present to thy mistress. Truly she will receive thee
well after its presentation! I will have it now sent in thy
name, with word that thou followest quickly. And for thy
nettled nose, surely if the whim seize thee that thou desirest
its chafing, to thy neighbour is permitted what to thy hand
is refused.”
So, the King set a guard upon Khipil to see that his
orders were executed, and appointed a time for him to return
to the gardens.
At the hour indicated Khipil stood before Shahpesh again.
He was pale, saddened ; his tongue drooped like the tongue
of a heavy bell, that when it soundeth giveth forth mourn-
ful sounds only: he had also the look of one battered with
many beatings. So the King said, “How of the presen-
tation of the flowers of thy culture, O Khipil ?".
He answered, “ Surely, 0 King, she received me with
wrath, and I am shamed by her.”


## p. 108 (#122) ############################################

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And the King said, “How of my clemency in the maiter
of the chafing?”
Khipil answered, "O King of splendours ! I made peti-
tion to my neighbours whom I met, accosting them civilly
and with imploring, for I ached to chafe, and it was the very
raging thirst of desire to chafe that was mine, devouring
intensity of eagerness for solace of chafing. And they
chafed me, 0 King; yet not in those parts which throbbed
for the chafing, but in those which abhorred it.”
Then Shahpesh smiled and said, “'T is certain that the
magnanimity of monarchs is as the rain that falleth, the sun
that shineth : and in this spot it fertilizeth richness; in that
encourageth rankness. So art thou but a weed, O Khipil !
and my grace is thy chastisement.”
Now, the King ceased not persecuting Khipil, under pre-
tence of doing him honour and heaping favours on him.
Three days and three nights was Khipil gasping without
water, compelled to drink of the drought of the fountain, as
an honour at the hands of the King. And he was seven
days and seven nights made to stand with stretched arms, as
they were the branches of a tree, in each hand a pomegranate.
And Shahpesh brought the people of his court to regard the
wondrous pomegranate-shoot planted by Khipil, very won-
drous, and a new sort, worthy the gardens of a King. So
the wisdom of the King was applauded, and men wotted he
knew how to punish offences in coin, by the punishment
inflicted on Khipil the builder. Before that time his affairs
had languished, and the currents of business instead of
flowing had become stagnant pools. It was the fashion to
do as did Khipil, and fancy the tongue a constructor rather
than a commentator; and there is a doom upon that people
and that man which runneth to seed in gabble, as the puet
says in his wisdom :
If thou wouldst be famous, and rich in splendid fruits,
Leave to bloom the flower of things, and dig among the roots.


## p. 109 (#123) ############################################

THE PUNISHMENT OF KHIPIL. 109
Truly after Khipil's punishment there were few in the
dominions of Shahpesh who sought to win the honours
bestowed by him on gabblers and idlers: as again the
poet:
When to loquacious fools with patience rare
I listen, I have thoughts of Khipil's chair :
His bath, his nosegay, and his fount I see,-
Himself stretch'd out as a pomegranate-tree.
And that I am not Shabpesh I regret,
So to inmesh the babbler in his net.
Well is that wisdom worthy to be sung,
Which raised the Palace of the Wagging Tongue!
And whoso is punished after the fashion of Shahpesh, the
Persian, on Khipil the Builder, is said to be one “in the
Palace of the Wagging Tongue" to this time.

THE GENIE KARAZ.
Now, when the voice of the Vizier had ceased, Shibli Bagarag
exclaimed, “O Vizier, this night, no later, I'll surprise
Shagpat, and shave him while he sleepeth : and he shall
wake shorn beside his spouse. Wullahy! I'll delay no
longer, I, Shibli Bagarag."
Said the Vizier, “ Thou?”
And he replied, “Surely, O Vizier ! thou knowest little
of my dexterity.”
So the Vizier laughed, and Noorna bin Noorka laughed,
and he was at a loss to interpret the cause of their laughter.
Then said Noorna, “O my betrothed, there's not a doubt
among us of thy dexterity, nor question of thy willingness;
but this shaving of Shagpat, wullahy! 't is longer work than
what thou makest of it."
And he cried, “How ? because of the Chief of Identicals
planted by thee in his head ?”
She answered, “Because of that; but 't is the smallest
opposer, that."
Then the Vizier said, “Let us consult.”
So, Shibli Bagarag gave ear, and the Vizier continued,
“There's first, the Chief of Identicals planted by thee in
the head of that presumptuous fellow, O my daughter! By
what means shall that be overcome?”
She said, “I rank not that first, O Feshnavat, my father ;

THE GENIE KARAZ.
111
surely I rank first the illusions with which Rabesqurat hath
surrounded him, and made it difficult to know him from his
semblances, whenever real danger threateneth him.”
The Vizier assented, saying, “ Second, then, the Chief of
Identicals ?"
She answered, “ Nay, O my father; second, the weakness
that's in man, and the little probability of his finishing with
Shagpat at one effort ; and there is but a sole chance for
whoso attempteth, and if he faileth, 't is for ever he faileth.”
So, the Vizier said, “Even I knew not 't was so grave !
Third, then, the Chief of Identicals ?”
She replied, “Third ! which showeth the difficulty of the
task. Read ye not, first, now the barber must come upon
Shagpat and fix him for his operation ; second, how the
barber must be possessed of more than mortal strength to
master him in so many strokes; third, how the barber must
have a blade like no other blade in this world in sharpness,
in temper, in velocity of sweep, that he may reap this crop
which flourisheth on Shagpat, and with it the magic hair
which defieth edge of mortal blades ?”
Now, the Vizier sighed at the words, saying, “ Powerful is.
Shagpat! I knew not the thing I undertook. I fear his
mastery of us, and we shall be contemned objects for the
red finger of scorn."
So, Noorna turned to Shibli Bagarag and asked, “Io the
three bonds of enterprise-vengeance, ambition, and love-
shrink in thee from this great contest ?”
Shibli Bagarag said, “'T is terrible ! on my head be it ! ”
She gazed at him a moment tenderly, and said, “ Thou art
worthy of what is in store for thee, O my betrothed ! and I
think little of the dangers, in contemplation of the courage in
thee. Lo, if vengeance and ambition spur thee so, how will
not love when added to the two ?”
Then said she, “ As to the enchantments and spells that
shall overreach him, and as to the blade wherewith to shear
him?"

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Feshnavat exclaimed, “ Yonder's indeed where we stumble
and are tripped at starting.”
But she cried, “What if I know of a sword that nought on
earth or under resisteth, and before the keen edge of which
all Illusions and Identicals are as summer grass to the
scythe."
They both shouted, “The whereabout of this sword, O
Noorna !”
So, she said, “'T is in Aklis, in the mountains of the Koosh;
and the seven sons of Aklis sharpen it day and night till the
adventurer cometh to claim it for his occasion. Whoso suc-
ceedeth in coming to them they know to have power over the
sword, and 't is then holiday for them. Many are the im-
pediments, and they are as holes where the fox haunteth. So,
they deliver to his hand the sword till his object is attained,
his Event mastered, smitten through with it; and 't is called
the Sword of Events. Surely, with it the father of the Seven
vanquished the mighty Roc, Kroojis, that threatened mankind
with ruin, and a stain of the Roc's blood is yet on the hilt of
the sword. How sayest thou, O Feshnavat,-shall we devote
ourselves to get possession of this Sword ? ”
So, the Vizier brightened at her words, and said, “O excel-
lent in wisdom and star of counsel ! speak further, and as to
the means.”
Noorna bin Noorka continued, “Thou knowest, O my father,
I am proficient in the arts of magic, and I am what I am, and
what I shall be, by its uses. 'T is known to thee also that I
hold a Genie in bondage, and can utter ten spells and one spell
in a breath. Surely my services to the youth in his attainment
of the Sword will be beyond price! Now to reach Aklis and
the Sword there are three things needed -charms : and one is
a phial full of the waters of Paravid from the wells in the
mountain yonside the desert; and one, certain hairs that grow
in the tail of the horse Garraveen, he that roameth wild in the
ineadows of Melistan; and one, that the youth gather and bear
to Aklis for the white antelope Gulrevaz, the Lily of the Lovely

Light, that groweth in the hollow of the crags over the En-
chanted Sea: with these spells he will command the Sword
of Aklis, and nothing can bar him passage. Moreover I will
expend in his aid all my subtleties, my transformations, the
stores of my wisdom. Many seek this Sword, and people the
realms of Rabesqurat, or are beasts in Aklis, or crowned Apes,
or go to feed the Roc, Kroojis, in the abyss beneath the Roc's-
egg bridge ; but there 's virtue in Shibli Bagarag: wullahy! I
am wistful in him of the hand of Destiny, and he will succeed
in this undertaking if he dareth it.”
Shibli Bagarag cried, “At thy bidding, O Noorna! Care
I for dangers ? I'm on fire to wield the Sword, and master
the Event.”
Thereupon, Noorna bin Noorka arose instantly, and took him
by the cheeks a tender pinch, and praised him. Then drew
she round him a circle with her forefinger that left a mark like
the shimmering of evanescent green flame, saying, “White
was the day I set eyes on thee!" Round the Vizier, her father,
she drew a like circle; and she took an unguent, and traced
with it characters on the two circles, and letters of strange
form, arrowy, lance-like, like leaning sheaves, and crouching
baboons, and kicking jackasses, and cocks a-crow, and lutes
slack-strung; and she knelt and mumbled over and over words
of magic, like the drone of a bee to hear, and as a roll of
water, nothing distinguishable. After that she sought for
an unguent of a red colour, and smeared it on a part of the
floor by the corner of the room, and wrote on it in silver fluid
a word that was the word “ Eblis," and over that likewise
she droned awhile. Presently she arose with a white-heated
face, the sweat on her brow, and said to Shibli Bagarag and
Feshnavat hurriedly and in a harsh tone, "How? have ye
fear ?"
They answered, “Our faith is in Allah, our confidence in
thee."
Said she then, “I summon the Genie I hold in bondage.
He will be wrathful; but ye are secure from him. He's this

moment in the farthest region of earth, doing ill, as is his wont,
and the wont of the stock of Eblis."
So the Vizier said. “He 'll be no true helper, this Genie,
and I care not for his company." .
She answered, “O my father! leave thou that to me.
What says the poet ?
*It is the sapiency of fools,
To sbrink from handling evil tools.'"
Now, while she was speaking she suddenly inclined her
ear as to a distant noise ; but they heard nothing. Then,
after again listening, she cried in a sharp voice, “Ho !
muffle your mouths with both hands, and stir not from the
ring of the circles, as ye value life and its blessings."
So, they did as she bade them, and watched her curiously.
Lo! she swathed the upper and lower part of her face in
linen, leaving the lips and eyes exposed; and she took
water from an ewer, and sprinkled it on her head, and on
her arms and her feet, muttering incantations. Then she
listened a third time, and stooped to the floor, and put her
lips to it, and called the name, “Karaz!” And she called
this name seven times loudly, sneezing between whiles.
Then, as it were in answer to her summons, there was a
deep growl of thunder, and the palace rocked—tottering;
and the air became smoky and full of curling vapours.
Presently they were aware of the cry of a Cat, and its
miaulings; and the patch of red unguent on the floor parted
and they beheld a tawny Cat with an arched back. So, Noorna
bin Noorka frowned fiercely at the Cat, and cried, “This is
thy shape, O Karaz; change! for it serves not the purpose.”
The Cat changed, and was a Leopard with glowing yellow
eyes, crouched for the spring. So, Noorna bin Noorka
stamped, and cried again, “This is thy shape, 0 Karaz ;
change ! for it serves not the purpose.”
And the Leopard changed, and was a Serpent with many
folds, sleek, curled, venomous, hissing.


## p. 115 (#129) ############################################

THE GENIE KARAZ.
115
So, Noorna bin Noorka cried in wrath, “This is thy shape,
O Karaz; change ! or thou 'lt be no other till Eblis is ac-
septed in Paradise.”
And the Serpent vanished. Lo ! in its place a Genie of
terrible aspect, black as a solitary tree seared by lightning;
his forehead ridged and cloven with red streaks; his hair
and ears reddened; his eyes like two hollow pits dug by the
shepherd for the wolf, and the wolf in them. He shouted,
“What work is it now, thou accursed traitress ? "
Noorna replied, “I've need of thee !"
So, he said, “ What shape ?”
She answered, “The shape of an Ass that will carry two
on its back, thou Perversity !”.
Upon that, he cried, “O faithless woman, how long shall
I be the slave of thy plotting ? Now, but for that hair of
my head, plucked by thy hand while I slept, I were free,
no doer of thy tasks. Say, who be these that mark
us ? "
She answered, “One, the Vizier Feshnavat; and one,
Shibli Bagarag of Shiraz, he that's destined to shave
Shagpat, the son of Shimpoor, the son of Shoolpi, the son of
Shullum; and the youth is my betrothed.”
Now, at her words the whole Genie became as live coal
with anger, and he panted black and bright, and made a
stride toward Shibli Bagarag, and stretched his arm out to
seize him; but Noorna blew quickly on the circles she had
drawn, and the circles rose up in a white flame high as the
heads of those present, and the Genie shrank hastily back
from the flame, and was seized with fits of sneezing. Then
she said in scorn, “Easily, 0 Karaz, is a woman outwitted !
Not so! Surely I could not guess what would be thy action !
and I was wanting in foresight and insight ! and I am a
woman bearing the weight of my power as a woodman
staggereth under the logs he hath felled !”
So, she taunted him, and he still sneezing and bent double
with the might of the sneeze. Then said Noorna in a stern

and Shibecame all colours, was clearly mer
voice, “No more altercation between us! Wait thou here
till I re-appear, O Karaz!”
Thereupon, she went from them; and the two, Feshnavat
and Shibli Bagarag, feared greatly being left with the Genie,
for he became all colours, and loured on them each time that
he ceased sneezing. He was clearly menacing them when
Noorna returned, and in her hand a saddle made of hide,
traced over with mystic characters and gold stripes.
So, she cried, “Take this !” Then, seeing he hesitated,
she unclosed from her left palm a powder, and scattered it
over him ; and he grew meek, and the bending knee of
obedience was his, and he took the saddle. So she said,
“ 'T is well! Go now, and wait outside the city in the
shape of an Ass, with this saddle on thy back.”
The Genie groaned, and said, “To hear is to obey !"
And he departed with those words, for she held him in
bondage. Then she calmed down the white flames of the
circles that enclosed Shibli Bagarag and the Vizier Feshnavat,
and they stepped forth, marvelling at the greatness of her
sorceries that held a Genie in bondage.


## p. 117 (#131) ############################################

THE WELL OF PARAVID.
Now, there was haste in the movements of Noorna bin
Noorka, and she arrayed herself and clutched Shibli Bag-
arag by the arm, and the twain departed from Feshnavat the
Vizier, and came to the outside of the city, and lo! there
was the Genie by a well under a palm, and he standing in
the shape of an Ass, saddled. So, they mounted him, and
in a moment they were in the midst of the desert, and
nought round them save the hot glimmer of the sands and
the strong grey of the sky. Surely, the Ass went at such a
pace as never Ass went before in this world, resting not by
the rivulets, nor under the palms, nor beside the date-
boughs; it was as if the Ass scurried without motion of his
legs, so swiftly went he. At last the desert gave signs of a
border on the low line of the distance, and this grew rapidly
higher as they advanced, revealing a country of hills and
rocks, and at the base of these the Ass rested.
So, Noorna said, “This desert that we have passed, O my
betrothed, many are they that perish in it, and reach not the
well; but give thanks to Allah that it is passed.”
Then said she, “Dismount, and be wary of moving to the
front or to the rear of this Ass, and measure thy distance
from the lash of his tail.”
So Shibli Bagarag dismounted, and followed her up the
hills and the rocks, through ravines and gorges of the rocks,
and by tumbling torrents, among hanging woods, over peri-
lous precipices, where no sun hath pierced, and the bones of

travellers whiten in loneliness; and they continued mounting
upward by winding paths, now closed in by coverts, now
upon open heights having great views, and presently a
mountain was disclosed to then, green at the sides high up
it as they could see; and Noorna bin Noorka said to Shibli
Bagarag, “Mount here, for the cunning of this Ass can
furnish him no excuse further for making thee food for the
birds of prey."
So, Shibli Bagarag mounted, and they ceased not to ascend
the green slopes till the grass became scanty and darkness
fell, and they were in a region of snow and cold. Then
Noorna bin Noorka tethered the Ass to a stump of a tree
and breathed in his ear, and the Ass became as a creature
carved in stone; and she drew from her bosom two bags of
silk, and blew in one and entered it, bidding Shibli Bagarag
do likewise with the other bag; and he obeyed her, drawing
it up to his neck, and the delightfulness of warmth came
over him. Then said she, “To-morrow, at noon, we shall
reach the summit of the mountain and the Well of Paravid,
if my power last over this Ass; and from that time thou
wilt be on the high road to greatness, so fail not to remember
what I have done for thee, and be not guilty of ingratitude
when thy hand is the stronger.”
So, he promised her, and they lay and slept. When he
awoke the sun was half-risen, and he looked at Noorna bin
Noorka in the silken bag, and she was yet in the peaceful-
ness of pleasant dreams; but for the Ass, surely his eyes
rclied, and his head and fore legs were endued with life, while
his latter half seemed of stone. And he called to Noorna.
bin Noorka, and pointed to her the strangeness of the condi-
tion of the Ass. As she cast eyes on him she cried out, and
rushed to him, and took him by the ears and blew up his
nostrils, and the animal was quiet. Then she and Shibli
Bagarag mounted him again, and she said to him, “It is well
thou wert more vigilant than I, and that the sun rose not on
this Ass while I slept, or my enchantment would have
thawed on him, and he would have 'scaped us.”

She gave her heel to the Ass, and the Ass hung his tail
in sullenness and drooped his head ; and she laughed, crying,
“O Karaz, silly fellow ! do thy work willingly, and take
wisely thine outwitting.”
She jeered him as they journeyed, and made the soul of
Shibli Bagarag merry, so that he jerked in his seat upon the
Ass. Now, as they ascended the mountain they came to the
opening of a cavern, and Noorna bin Noorka halted the Ass,
and said to Shibli Bagarag, “We part here, and I wait for
thee in this place. Take this phial, and fill it with the
waters of the well, after thy bath. The way is before thee-
speed on it.”
So, he climbed the sides of the mountain, and was soon
hidden in the clefts and beyond the highest perches of the
vulture. She kept her eyes on the rocky point when ho
disappeared, awaiting his return; and the sun went over her
head and sank on the yonside of the mountain, and it was by
the beams of the moon that she beheld Shibli Bagarag
dropping from the crags and ledges of rock, sliding and
steadying himself downward till he reached her with the
phial in his hand, filled ; and he was radiant, as it were
divine with freshness, so that Noorna, before she spoke
welcome to him, was lost in contemplating the warm shine
of his visage, calling to mind the poet's words :
The wealth of light in sun and moon,
All nature's wealth,
Hath mortal beauty for a boon
When match'd with health.
Then said she, “O Shibli Bagarag, 't is achieved, this
first of thy tasks; for mutely on the fresh red of thy mouth,
my betrothed, speaketh the honey of persuasiveness, and the
children of Aklis will not resist thee.” So she took the
phial from him and led forth the Ass, and the twain mounted
the Ass and descended the slopes of the mountain in moon-
light; and Shibli Bagarag said, “Lo! I have marked
wonders, and lived a life since our parting; and this well, it

is a miracle to dip in it, and by it sit many maide is weeping
and old men babbling, and youths that were idle youths
striking bubbles from the surface of the water. The well is
rounded with marble, and the sky is clear in it, cool in it,
the whole earth imaged therein.”
Then Noorna said, “ Hadst thou a difficulty in obtaining
the waters of the well ?”
He answered, “Surely, all was made smooth for me by thy
aid. Now when I came to the well I marked not them by
it, but plunged, and the depth of that well seemed to me the
very depth of the earth itself, so went I ever downward;
and when I was near the bottom of the well I had forgotten
life above, and lo! no sooner had I touched the bottom of
the well when my head emerged from the surface : 't was
wondrous ! But for a sign that I touched the bottom of the
well, see, O Noorna bin Noorka, the Jewel, the one of myriads
that glitter at the bottom, and I plucked it for a gift to thee.”
So, Noorna took the Jewel from his hand that was torn
and crimson, and she cried, “Thou fair youth, thou bleedest
with the plucking of it, and it was written, no hand shall
pluck a jewel at the bottom of that well without letting of
blood. Even so is it! Worthy art thou, and I was not
mistaken in thee."
At her words Shibli Bagarag burst forth into praises of her,
and he sang :
What is my worthiness
Match'd with thy worth?
Darkness and earthiness,
Dust and dearth!
O Noorna, thou art wise above women: great and glorious
over them.”
In this fashion the youth lauded her that was his betrothed,
but she exclaimed, “Hush! or the jealousy of this Ass will
be aroused, and of a surety he 'll spill us."
· Then he laughed and she laughed till the tail of Karaz
trembled.

THE HORSE GARRAVEEN.
Now, they descended leisurely the slopes of the mountain,
and when they were again in the green of its base, Noorna
called to the Ass, “Ho! Karaz! sniff now the breezes, for
the end of our journey by night is the ineadows of Melistan.
Forward in thy might, and bray not when we are in them,
for thy comfort's sake !"
The Ass sniffed, turning to the four quarters, and chose a
certain direction, and bore them swiftly over hills and streams
eddying in silver; over huge mounds of sand, where the
tents of Bedouins stood in white clusters; over lakes smooth
as the cheeks of sleeping loveliness; by walls of cities,
mosques, and palaces; under towers that rose as an armed
man with the steel on his brows and the frown of battle ; by
shores of the pale foaming sea it bore them, going at a pace that
the Arab on his steed outstrippeth not. So when the sun
was red and the dews were blushing with new light, they
struggled from a wilderness of barren broken ground, and
saw beneath them, in the warm beams, green, peaceful, deep,
the meadows of Melistan. They were meadows dancing
with flowers, as it had been fresh damsels of the mountain,
fair with variety of colours that were so many gleams of
changing light as the breezes of the morn swept over them;
lavish of hues, of sweetness, of pleasantness, fit garden for
the souls of the blest. Then, after they had gazed awhile,
Noorna bin Noorka said, “In these meadows the Horse

Garraveen roameth at will. Heroes of bliss bestride him on
great days. He is black to look on ; speed quivers in his-
flanks like the lightning; his nostrils are wide with flame;
there is that in his eye which is settled fire, and that in his
hooves which is ready thunder; when he paws the earth
kingdoms quake: no animal liveth with blood like the Horse
Garraveen. He is under a curse, for that he bore on his.
back one who defied the Prophet. Now, to make him come
to thee thou must blow the call of battle, and to catch him
thou must contrive to strike him on the fetlock as he runs
with this musk-ball which I give thee; and to tame him
thou must trace between his eyes a figure of the crescent
with thy forenail. When that is done, bring him to me
here, where I await thee, and I will advise thee further.”
So, she said, “Go !" and Shibli Bagarag showed her the
breadth of his shoulders, and stepped briskly toward the
meadows, and was soon brushing among the flowers and soft
mosses of the meadows, lifting his nostrils to the joyful
smells, looking about him with the broad eye of one that
hungereth for a coming thing. The birds went up above
him, and the trees shook and sparkled, and the waters of
brooks and broad rivers flashed like waving mirrors waved.
by the slave-girls in sport when the beauties of the harem
riot and dip their gleaming shoulders in the bath. He
wandered on, lost in the gladness that lived, till the loud
neigh of a steed startled him, and by the banks of a river
before him he beheld the Horse Garraveen stooping to drink
of the river; glorious was the look of the creature,-silver-
hoofed, fashioned in the curves of beauty and swiftness. So.
Shibli Bagarag put up his two hands and blew the call of
battle, and the Horse Garraveen arched his neck at the call,
and swung upon his haunches, and sought the call, answering
it, and tossing his mane as he advanced swiftly. Then, as.
he neared, Shibli Bagarag held the musk-ball in his fingers,
and aimed at the fetlock of the Horse Garraveen, and flung it,
and struck him so that he stumbled and fell. He snorted.

fiercely as he bent to the grass, but Shibli Bagarag ran to
him, and grasped strongly the tuft of hair hanging forward
between his ears, and traced between his fine eyes a figure of
the crescent with his forenail, and the Horse ceased plunging,
and was gentle as a colt by its mother's side, and suffered
Shibli Bagarag to bestride him, and spurn him with his
heel to speed, and bore him fleetly across the fair length of
the golden meadows to where Noorna bin Noorka sat await-
ing him. She uttered a cry of welcome, saying, “ This is
achieved with diligence and skill, O my betrothed ! and on
thy right wrist I mark strength like a sleeping leopard, and
the children of Aklis will not resist thee.”
So, she bade him alight from the Horse, but he said,
“Nay.” And she called to him again to alight, but he cried,
“I will not alight from him! By Allah ! such a bounding
wave of bliss have I never yet had beneath me, and I will
give him rein once again; as the poet says:
,
Divinely rings the rushing air
When I am on my mettled mare :
When fast along the plains we fly,
A creature of the heavens am 1.'”
Then she levelled her brows at him, and said gravely,
“This is the temptation thou art falling into, as have thou-
sands before thy time. Give him the rein a second time,
and he will bear thee to the red pit, and halt upon the brink,
and pitch thee into it among bleeding masses and skeletons
of thy kind, where they lie who were men like to thee, and
were borne away by the Horse Garraveen." .
He gave no heed to her words, taunting her, and making
the animal prance up and prove its spirit.
And she cried reproachfully, “O fool! is it thus our great
aim will be defeated by thy silly conceit? Lo, now, the
greatness and the happiness thou art losing for this idle
vanity is to be as a dunghill cock matched with an ostrich;

and think not to escape the calamities thou bringest on thy-
self, for as is said,
•
No runner can outstrip his fate;
and it will overtake thee, though thou part like an arrow
from the bow."
He still made a jest of her remonstrance, trying the temper
of the animal, and rejoicing in its dark flushes of ireful
vigour.
And she cried out furiously, “How ! art thou past counsel ?
then will we match strength with strength ere 't is too late,
though it weaken both.”
Upon that, she turned quickly to the Ass and stroked it
from one extremity to the other, crying, “Karaz! Karaz !"
shouting, “ Come forth in thy power !” And the Ass
vanished, and the Genie stood in his place, tall, dark,
terrible as a pillar of storm to travellers ranging the desert.
He exclaimed, “What is it, О woman ? Charge me with
thy command !”
And she said, "Wrestle with him thou seest on the Horse
Garraveen, and fling him from his seat.”
Then he yelled a glad yell, and stooped to Shibli Bagarag
on the horse and enveloped him, and seized him, and
plucked him from the Horse, and whirled him round, and
flung him off. The youth went circling in the air, high in
it, and descended, circling, at a distance in the deep meadow-
waters. When he crept up the banks he saw the Genie
astride the Horse Garraveen, with a black flame round his
head ; and the Genie urged him to speed and put him to the
gallop, and was soon lost to sight, as he had been a thunder-
beam passing over a still lake at midnight. And Shibli
Bagarag was smitten with the wrong and the folly of his act,
and sought to hide his sight from Noorna; but she called to
him, "Look up, O youth ! and face the calamity. Lo, we
have now lost the service of Karaz! for though I utter ten
spells and one spell in a breath, the Horse Garraveen will ere

that have stretched beyond the circle of my magic, and the
Genie will be free to do his ill deeds and plot against us.
Sad is it! but profit thou by a knowledge of thy weakness.”
Then said she, “See, I have not failed to possess myself of
the three hairs of Garraveen, and there is that to rejoice in."
She displayed them, and they were sapphire hairs, and
had a flickering light; and they seemed to live, wriggling
their lengths, and were as snakes with sapphire skins.
Then she said, “Thy right wrist, O my betrothed !”
He gave her his right wrist, and she tied round it the
three hairs of Garraveen, exclaiming, “ Thus do skilful
carpenters make stronger what has broken and indicated
disaster. Surely, I confide in thy star? I have faith in my
foresight ?”
And she cried, “ Eyes of mine, what sayest thou to me ?
Lo, we must part awhile : it is written."
Said he, “ Leave me not, my betrothed : what am I with-
out thy counsel ? And go not from me, or this adventure
will come to miserable issue.”
So, she said, “Thou beginnest to feel my worth ?”
He answered, “O Noorna! was woman like thee before
in this world ? Surely 't is a mask I mark thee under; yet
art thou perforce of sheer wisdom and sweet manners lovely
in my sight; and I have a thirst to hear thee and look on
thee."
While he spake, a beam of struggling splendour burst
from her, and she said, “O thou dear youth, yes ! I must
even go. But I go glad of heart, knowing thee prepared to
love me. I must go to counteract the machinations of
Karaz, for he's at once busy, vindictive, and cunning, and
there's no time for us to lose ; so farewell, my betrothed,
and make thy wits keen to know me when we next meet.”
So, he said, “And I—whither go I ?”
She answered, “ To the City of Oolb straightway.”
Then he, “But I know not its bearing from this spot :
how reach it?” -

She answered, “What ! thou with the phial of Paravid
in thy vest, that endoweth, a single drop of it, the flowers,
the herbage, the very stones and desert sands, with a tongue
to articulate intelligible talk ?"
Said he, “Is it so ?”
She answered, “ Even so."
Ere Shibli Bagarag could question her further she
embraced him, and blew upon his eyes, and he was blinded
by her breath, and saw not her departure, groping for a seat
on the rocks, and thinking her still by him. Sight returned
not to him till long after weariness had brought the balm of
sleep upon his eyelids.

THE TALKING HAWK.
Now, when he awoke he found himself alone in that place,
the moon shining over the low meadows and flower-cups fair
with nightdew. Odours of night-flowers were abroad, filling
the cool air with deliciousness, and he heard in the gardens
below songs of the bulbul : it was like a dream to his soul,
and he lay somewhile contemplating the rich loveliness of the
scene, that showed no moving thing. Then rose he and
bethought him of the words of Noorna, and of the City of
Oolb, and the phial of the waters of Paravid in his vest; and
he drew it forth, and dropped a drop of it on the rock where
he had reclined. A deep harmony seemed suddenly to
awake inside the rock, and to his interrogation as to the
direction of Oolb, he heard, “ The path of the shadows of
the moon."
Thereupon he advanced to a prominent part of the rocks
above the meadows, and beheld the shadows of the moon
thrown forward into dimness across a waste of sand. And he
stepped downward to the level of sand, and went the way of
the shadows till it was dawn. Then dropped he a drop of
the waters of the phial on a spike of lavender, and there was
a voice said to him in reply to what he questioned, “The
path of the shadows of the sun.”
The shadows of the sun were thrown forward across the
same waste of sand, and he turned and pursued his way,
resting at noon beneath a date-tree, and refreshing himself

at a clear spring beside it. Surely he was joyful as he
journeyed, and elated with high prospects, singing :
Sun and moon with their bright fingers
Point the hero's path;
If in his great work he lingers,
Well may they be wroth.
Now, the extent of the duration of his travel was four days
and an equal number of nights; and it was on the fifth morn
that he entered the gates of a city by the sea, even at that
hour when the inhabitants were rising from sleep: fair was
the sea beyond it, and the harbour was crowded with vessels,
ships stored with merchandise-silks, dates, diamonds,
Damascus steel, huge bales piled on the decks for the land
of Roum and other lands. Shibli Bagarag thought, “There's
scarce a doubt but that one of those sails will set for Oolb
shortly. Wullahy! if I knew which, I'd board her and win
a berth in her.” Presently he thought, “I'll go to the
public fountain and question it with the speech-winning
waters." Thereupon he passed down the streets of the city
and came to an open space, where stood the fountain, and
sprinkled it with Paravid ; and the fountain spake, saying,
“Where men are, question not dumb things."
Cried he, “Faileth Paravid in its power ? Have I done
ought to baffle myself ?”.
Then he thought, “'T were nevertheless well to do as the
fountain directeth, and question men while I see them.”
And he walked about among the people, and came to the
quays of the harbour where the ships lay close in, many of
them an easy leap from shore, and considered whom to
address. So, as he loitered about the quays, meditating on
the means at the disposal of the All-Wise, and marking the
vessels wistfully, behold, there advanced to him one at a
quick pace, in the garb of a sailor. He observed Shibli
Bagarag attentively a moment, and exclaimed as it were in
the plenitude of respect and with the manner of one that is

abashed, “Surely, thou art Shibli Bagarag, the nephew of
the barber, him we watch for."
So, Shibli Bagarag marvelled at this recognition, and an-
swered, “Even so; am I then already famous to that
extent ?"
And he that accosted him said, "'T is certain the trumpet
was blown before thy steps, and there is not a man in this
city but knoweth of thy destination to the City of Oolb, and
that thou art upon the track of great things, one chosen to
bring about imminent changes.”
Then said Shibli Bagarag, “For this I praise Noorna bin
Noorka, daughter of Feshnavat, Vizier of the King that ruleth
in the city of Shagpat! She saw me, that I was marked for
greatness. Wullahy, the eagle knoweth me from afar, and
proclaimeth me; the antelope of the hills scenteth the coming
of one not as other men, and telleth his tidings; the wind of
the desert shapeth its gust to a meaning, so that the stranger
may wot Shibli Bagarag is at hand !”.
So, he puffed his chest, and straightened his legs like the
cock, and was as a man upon whom the Sultan has bestowed
a dress of honour, even as the plumed peacock. Then the
other said :
“Know that I am captain of yonder vessel, that stands
farthest out from the harbour with her sails slackened ; and
she is laden with figs and fruits which I exchange for silks,
spices, and other merchandise, with the people of Oolb. Now,
what says the poet ?—
Delay in thine undertaking
Is disaster of thy own making ;'
and he says also :
"Greatness is solely for them that succeed ;
'T is a rotten applause that gives earlier meed.'
Therefore it is advisable for thee to follow me on board with.
out loss of time, and we will sail this very night for the City
of Oolb."

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Now, Shibli Bagarag was ruled by the words of the cap-
tain albeit he desired to stay awhile and receive the homage
of the people of that city. So, he followed him into a boat
that was by, and the twain were rowed by sailors to the ship.
Then, when they were aboard the captain set sail, and they
were soon in the hollows of deep waters. Now, there was a
berth in the ship set apart for Shibli Bagarag, and one for
the captain. Shibli Bagarag, when he entered his berth,
beheld at the head of his couch a hawk; its eyes red as rubies,
its beak sharp as the curve of a scimitar. So he called out
to the captain, and the captain came to him ; but when he
saw the hawk, he plucked his turban from his head, and
dashed it at the hawk, and afterwards ran to it, trying to
catch it; and the hawk flitted from corner to corner of the
berth, he after it with open arms. Then he took a sword,
but the hawk flew past him, and fixed on the back part of his
head, tearing up his hair by the talons, and pecking over his
forehead at his eyes. And Shibli Bagarag heard the hawk
scream the name “Karaz," and he looked closely at the captain
of the vessei, and knew him for the Genie Karaz. Then
trembled he with exceeding terror, cursing his credulities,
for he saw himself in the hands of the Genie, and nothing
but this hawk friendly to him on the fearful waters. Now,
when the hawk had torn up a certain hair, the Genie
stiffened, and glowed like copper in the furnace, the whole
length of him; and he descended heavily through the bottom
of the ship, and sank into the waters beneath, which hissed
and smoked as at a bar of heated iron. Then, Shibli Bagarag
gave thanks to the Prophet, and praised the hawk, but the
hawk darted out of the cabin, and he followed it on deck,
and, lo! the vessel was in flames, and the hawk in a circle
of the flames; and the flames soared with it, and left it no
outlet. Now, as Shibli Bagarag watched the hawk, the
flames stretched out towards him and took hold of his
vestments. So, he delayed not to commend his soul to the
All-merciful, and bore witness to his faith, and plunged into

131
the sea headlong. When he rose, the vessel had vanished,
and all was darkness where it had been; so he buffeted with
the billows, thinking his last hour had come, and there was no
help for him in this world; and the spray shaken from the
billows blinded him, the great walls of water crumbled over
him; strength failed him, and his memory ceased to picture
images of the old time—his heart to beat with ambition; and
to keep the weight of his head above the surface was becom-
ing a difficulty, a thing worth the ransom of kings. So, as
he was sinking and turning his eyes upward, he heard a
flutter as of fledgling's wings, and the two red ruby eyes of
the hawk were visible above him, like steady fires in the
gloom. And the hawk perched on him, and buried itself
among the wet hairs of his head, and presently taking the
Identical in its beak, the hawk lifted him half out of water,
and bore him a distance, and dropped him. This the hawk
did many times, and at the last, Shibli Bagarag felt land
beneath him, and could wade through the surges to the
shore. So, he gave thanks to the Supreme Disposer, kneeling
prostrate on the shore, and fell into a sleep deep in peaceful-
ness as a fathomless well, unruffled by a breath.
Now, when it was dawn Shibli Bagarag awoke and looked
inland, and saw plainly the minarets of a city shining in the
first beams, and the front of yellow mountains, and people
moving about the walls and on the towers and among the
pastures round the city ; so he made toward them, and in-
quired of them the name of their city. And they stared at
him, crying, “What ! know'st thou not the City of Oolb?
the hawk on thy shoulder could tell thee that much.” He
looked and saw that the hawk was on his shoulder; and its
left wing was scorched, the plumage blackened. So he said
to the hawk, “ Is it profitable, O preserving bird, to ask of
thee questions?”
The hawk shook its wings and closed an eye.
So, he said, “Do I well in entering this city ?”.
The hawk shook its wings again and closed an eye.

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So, he said, “ To what house shall I direct my steps in this
strange city for the attainment of the purpose I have ?”
The hawk flew, and soared, and alighted on the topmost
of the towers of Oolb. So when it returned he said, “O
bird ! rare bird ! my counsellor! it is an indication, this
alighting on the highest tower, that thou advisest me to go
straight to the palace of the King ?”
The hawk flapped its wings and winked both eyes
violently; so Shibli Bagarag took forth the phial from his
breast, remembering the virtues of the waters of the Well of
Paravid, and touched his lips with them, that he might be
endowed with flowing speech before the King of Oolb. Now,
as he did this the phial was open, and the hawk leaned to it
and dipped its beak into the water; and he entered the city
and passed through the long streets towards the palace of the
King, and craved audience of him as one that had a thing
marvellous to tell. So, the King commanded that Shibli
Bagarag should be brought before him, for he was a lover of
marvels. As he went into the presence of the King, Shibli
Bagarag listened to the hawk, for the hawk spake his
language, and it said, “Proclaim to the King a new wonder-
the talking hawk.'"
So, when he had bent his body to the King, he proclaimed
the new wonder; and the King seemed not to observe the
hawk, and said, “From what city art thou ?”
He answered, “Native, O King, to Shiraz ; newly from
the City of Shagpat.”
And the King asked, “How is it with that hairy wonder?"
He answered, “ The dark forest flourisheth about him."
And the King said, “That is well! We of the City of
Oolb take our fashions from them of the City of Shagpat,
and it is but yesterday that I bastinadoed a barber that
strayed among us."
Shibli Bagarag sighed when he heard the King, and
thought to himself, “How unfortunate is the race of barbers,
once honourable and in esteem! Surely it will not be other-

wise till Shagpat is shaved !” And the King called out to
him for the cause of his sighing; so he said, “I sigh, O
King of the age, considering how like may be the case of the
barber bastinadoed but yesterday, in his worth and value, to
that of Rumdrum, the reader of planets, that was a barber.”
And the King cried, “What of that case ? let us hear
it!"
So, Shibli Bagarag said :


## p. 134 (#148) ############################################

AND THIS IS THE CASE OF RUM-
DRUM, A READER OF PLANETS,
THAT WAS A BARBER.
It is told of Rumdrum, 0 King, that he was a barber, and a
reader of planets : by day he operated on the heads of men,
and at night interpreted the stars. Now, Rumdrum talked
and had enemies, and they were active with the King of the
city where Rumdrum dwelt. The King was at war with
the armies of a neighbouring nation, and the enemies of
Rumdrum declared to the King that Rumdrum had an
understanding with the Chiefs of those armies. So, the
displeasure of the King fell upon Rumdrum, and he walked
with the eye of abasement, even under a cloud full of direful
bolts, as is said of them that arouse the wrath of kings : and
the coolness of the barber forsook him, the firmness of
glance, the steadiness of hand. He was in this condition
when one day the King sent for him to the palace, to exert
his craft. So, Rumdrum went armed with his tackle. At
the palace-gates he was greeted by the cook of the palace,
the head-cook, that was his friend; and the head-cook
warned Rumdrum of the doings of his enemies. And
Rumdrum said, “I have seen all this by my science and my
foresight, but there is that upon the head of the King which
cleareth a mystery, one concerning himself, and for his sake
I will go."
So, Rumdrum went and kissed the ground of obedience

THE CASE OF RUMDRUM.

before the King, and arranged his tackle, and commenced
shaving the King, for this time was before the time of Shag-
pat, when kings were shaved, and men; wullahy! it was
a time not without its glory, and there was one art the more
exercised !
Now, while Rumdrum shaved the King, the King
questioned him as to future occurrences, and he said,
“How is it, 0 Rumdrum ; will mine enemies succeed in
what they undertake ?”
And Rumdrum gave the King an answer pleasant in ex-
pression, but unsavoury to swallow.
Now, the King thought, “ This fellow is beguiling me?
with double meanings, and the sweet concealeth the sour in
what he says.” So, while the blade of Rumdrum swept
over him like a gleam across the water, he made a signal to
his guard for the guard to close upon Rumdrum. As they
closed upon him Rumdrum shrieked, and struggled to get
back to the King, and offered the guard bribes of money,
rare gifts, to let him peer once more upon the head of the
King; and the King was confirmed in his suspicions of
Rumdrum. So, he had the bow slung about the neck of
Rumdrum, and accused him of the crime of a traitor. And
Rumdrum said, “O King, there is nought like to confidence
in thy kind; and he that dishonoureth the barber is in turn
dishonoured, seeing that it is a craft made familiar with the
noblest part of man, and a craft intimate with occurrences,
charged with foretellings. Now, that I may prove my
words, grant me one day and one night further of life, and
on the morrow let me die.”
So, the King granted him a day and a night to live, and
on the morrow Rumdrum handed a sealed paper to the
King, and died by the tightening of the bow round his neck.
Then the King opened the packet, and in it was traced the
figure of a barber crowned and in the robes of a King on his

ance !” And the King, when he had seen that, said,
“ There was wisdom in Rumdrum, and by killing him I
have made him potent to shame me and insult me, he that
was in life my slave, so of a surety I repent."
The King turned to a second leaf of the packet, and there
was traced a figure of the King, the barber, and the Angel
of Death; and the barber was shielding the head of the
King from the stroke of Azrael ; under it were the words,
“Let him that marketh the figure of the King, the barber,
and the Angel of Death, acknowledge the faithfulness of
Rumdrum.” And the King, when he had seen that, said,
“There was faithfulness in Rumdrum, for his opportunities
were many of delivering me over to the Angel of Death, yet
he shielded me.”
The King turned to a third leaf of the packet, and there
was traced a tomb beside a cypress ; under it were the words,
“Let him that marketh this tomb beside the cypress come
to it by night, and acknowledge the privilege of the dead."
So, the King went by night to the tomb of the barber, and
stood beside the tomb; and a voice as from the hollow of
the tomb called to him for the reason of his coming. The
King said, “I come hither to learn the privilege of the dead."
And the Voice answered, “It is the privilege of the dead
to speak truth when they speak, without fear of kings.”
The King said, “Tell me then, am I well served, secure
from traitors, beloved by my wives, my courtiers, and my
people ?"
And the Voice answered, “It is the privilege of the dead
to be silent when they please, without fear of kings."
The King reflected, and his heart smote him for his con-
duct to the barber. He said, “If thou be Rumdrum en-
closed in this tomb, listen to my praises of him and my
sorrow for his loss; he that was wise, faithful, a reader of
planets; whose tongue went much, but whose heart beat
true; who has filled with remorse and regret the King's
breast, his eyes with tears, his thoughts with bitterness."

THE CASE OF RUMDRUM.
137
And the Voice answered, “It is the privilege of the dead
to scorn flatteries, even from the mouths of kings.”
Then the King cried aloud, “Oh, how great is the privilege
of the dead! There is no privilege like to that they possess !
Strong are they! He that punisheth the innocent is but an
instrument to exalt them, scourged for his pains.”
Now, while the King was lost in self-abasement, the Voice
said, “Know, great King, that the restlessness of an un-
completed work is on the tomb of Rumdrum the barber, and
if thou wouldst appease him, call hither one to shave thee,
and lay upon his tomb the hairs of thy head."
So, the King did this, and was shaved and laid the hairs
upon the tomb. Then the Voice said, “O King, the calcu-
lations of Rumdrum were cut short, and in the tomb he can-
not take them up, for no science availeth in the tomb, as is
written :
The thoughts of heads,
The works of hands,
Are severed threads,
And broken bands.'
Now, he calculated thy nativity, and was summing the
number of thy hairs when he was torn from thee, and the
thing he would have foretold is dumb; so if thou wouldst
know it, set thyself to count the number of thy hairs upon
this tomb diligently, counting two for the hair of fortune,
which is the Identical. And cease not to count, for when
thou holdest off from counting it is the end of thy days."
So, the King saw what he had lost in Rumdrum the
barber, for he knew not the Identical, which is the hair of
fortune, to count two for it; and his days were given to the
counting these hairs upon the tomb, he fearing to hold off
from counting lest death should surprise him. Wah! it is
an ill thing to do an injustice, which springeth from suspicion,
as the poet has said !
So, the King saw what he had lost in Rumdrum the
barber.

GOORELKA OF OOLB.
WHEN Shibli Bagarag had finished his narration of the case
of Rumdrum the barber, the King of Oolb said, “O thou,
native of Shiraz, there is persuasion and sweetness and
fascination on thy tongue, and I am touched with compassion
for the soles of Baba Mustapha, that I bastinadoed but
yesterday, and he was from Shiraz likewise.”
Now, the heart of Shibli Bagarag leapt when he heard
mention of Baba Mustapha; and he knew him for his uncle
that was searching him. He would have cried aloud his
relationship, but the hawk whispered “ Silence !” in his ear.
Then the hawk said to him, “There is danger in the King's
muteness respecting me, for I am visible to him. Proclaim
therefore the spirit of prophecy.”
So, he proclaimed the spirit of prophecy, and the King
said, “Prophecy to me of barbercraft.”
And he cried, “O King of the age, the barber is abased,
trodden underfoot, given over to the sneers and the gibes of
them that flatter the powerful ones; he is as the winter
worm, as the crocodile in the slime of his sleep by the bank,
as the sick eagle before moulting. But I say, 0 King, that
he will come forth like the serpent in a new skin, shaming
the old one; he slept a caterpillar, and will come forth a
butterfly ; he sank a star, and lo! he riseth a constellation."
Now, while he was speaking in the fervour of his soul, the
King said something to one of the court officers surrounding

139
him, and there was brought to the King a basin, a soap-bowl,
and barber's tackle. When Shibli Bagarag saw these, the
uses of the barber rushed upon his mind, and desire to sway
the tackle pushed him forward and agitated him, so that he
could not keep his hand from them.
Then, the King exclaimed, “It is as I thought. Our pas-
sions betray themselves, and our habits; so is it written,
By Allah ! I swear thou art thyself none other than a barber,
O youth.”
Shibli Bagarag was nigh fainting with terror at this dis-
covery of the King, but the hawk said in his ear, “Proclaim
speech in the tackle." So he proclaimed speech in the
tackle ; and the King smiled doubtingly, and said, “ If this
be a cheat, Shiraz will not see thy face more."
Then, the hawk whispered in his ear, “Drop on the tackle
secretly a drop from the phial.” This he did, spreading his
garments, and commanded the tackle to speak. And the
tackle spake, each portion of it, confusedly as the noise of
Babel. So the King marvelled greatly, and said, “T is a
greater wonder than the talking hawk, the talking tackle.
Wullahy! it ennobleth barbercraft! Yet it were well to
comprehend the saying of the tackle."
Then, the hawk flew to the tackle and fluttered about it,
and lo! the blade and the brush stood up and said in a shrill
tone, “ It is ordained that Shagpat shall be shaved, and that
Shibli Bagarag shall shave him.”
The King bit the forefinger of amazement, and said,
What then ensueth, 0 talking tackle ?"
And the brush and the blade stood up, and said in a shrill
tone, “Honour to Shibli Bagarag and barbers! Shame unto
Shagpat and his fellows !”
Upon that, the King cried, “Enough, 0 talking tackle; I
will forestal the coming thing. I will be shaved ! wullahy,
that will I !”
Then the hawk whispered to Shibli Bagarag, “Forward
and shear him!” So he stepped forth and seized the tackle,

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
and addressed himself keenly to the shaving of the King of
Oolb, lathering him and performing his task with perfect skill.
And the courtiers crowded to follow the example of the
King, and Shibli Bagarag shaved them, all of them. Now,
when they were shaved, fear smote them, the fear of ridicule,
and each laughed at the change that was in the other; but
the King cried, " See that order is issued for the people of
Oolb to be as we before to-morrow's sun. So is laughter
taken in reverse.” And the King said aside to Shibli
Bagarag, “Say now, what may be thy price for yonder
hawk ?”
And the hawk bade him say, “The loan of thy
cockle-shell."
The King mused, and said, “That is much to ask, for it is
that which beareth the Princess my daughter to the Lily of
the Enchanted Sea, which she nourisheth; and if 't is
harmed, she will be stricken with ugliness, as was the
daughter of the Vizier Feshnavat, who tended it before her.
Yet is this hawk a bird of price. What be its qualities,
beside speech ?”
Shibli Bagarag answered, “ To counsel in extremity ; to
forewarn; to counteract enchantments and foul magic."
So, upon that the King said, “Follow me!”
And the King led the way from the hall, through many
spacious chambers fair with mirrors and silks and precious
woods, and smooth marble floors, down into a vault lit by a
lamp that was shaped like an eye. Round the vault were
hung helm-pieces, and swords, and rich-studded housings;
and there were silken dresses, and costly shawls, and tall vases
and jars of China, tapestries, and gold services. And the
King said, “Take thy choice of these in exchange for the
hawk."
But Shibli Bagarag said, “Nought save a loan of the
cockle-shell, O King!"
Then the King threatened him, saying, “There is a
virtue in each of the things thou seest : the China jar is

141
Srimmed with wine, and remaineth so though a thousand
drink of it; the dress of Samarcand rendereth the wearer
invisible; yet thou refusest to exchange them for thy
hawk ! "
And the King swore by the beard of his father he would
seize perforce the hawk and shut up Shibli Bagarag in the
vault, if he fell not into his bargain. Shibli Bagarag was
advised by the hawk to accept the China jar and the dress
of Samarcand, and handed the hawk to the King in
exchange for these things. So the King took the hawk
upon his wrist and departed with it to the apartments of
his daughter, and Shibli Bagarag went to the chamber pre-
pared for him in the palace.
Now, when it was night, Shibli Bagarag heard a noise at
his lattice, and he arose and peered through it, and lo ! the
hawk was fluttering without; so he let it in, and caressed it,
and the hawk bade him put on his silken dress and carry
forth his China jar, and go the round of the palace, and offer
drink to the sentinels and the slaves. So he did as the hawk
directed, and the sentinels and slaves were aware of a China
jar brimmed with wine that was lifted to their lips, but he
that lifted it they saw not : surely, they drank deep of the
draught of astonishment.
Then, the hawk flew before him, and he followed it to a
chamber lit with golden lamps, gorgeously hung, and full of
a dusky splendour and the faint sparkle of gems, ruby,
amethyst, topaz, and beryl ; in it there was the hush of
sleep, and the heart of Shibli Bagarag told him that one
beautiful was near. So, he approached on tiptoe a couch of
blue silk, bordered with gold-wire, and inwoven with stars
of blue turquoise stones, as it had been the heavens of mid-
night. On the couch lay one, a woman, pure in loveliness ;
the dark fringes of her closed lids like living flashes of dark-
ness, her mouth like an unstrung bow and as a double rose-
bud, even as two isles of coral between which in the clear
transparent watery beds the pearls shine freshly.

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And the hawk said to Shibli Bagarag, “This is the
Princess Goorelka, the daughter of the King of Oolb, a
sorceress, the Guardian of the Lily of the Enchanted Sea.
Beneath her pillow is the cockle-shell; grasp it, but gaze not
upon her.”
So, he approached and slid his arm beneath the pillow of
the Princess, and grasped the cockle-shell; but ere he drew
it forth he gazed upon her, and the lustre of her countenance
transfixed him as with a javelin, so that he could not stir,
nor move his eyes from the contemplation of her sweetness
of feature. The hawk darted at him fiercely, and pecked at
him to draw his attention from her, yet he continued im-
movable, taking fatal draughts from the magic cup of her
beauty. Then, the hawk screamed a loud scream of anguish,
and the Princess awoke, and started half-way from the couch,
and stared about her, and saw the bird in agitation. Now,
as she looked at the bird a shudder passed over her, and she
snatched a veil and drew it over her face, murmuring, “I
dream, or I am under the eye of a man.” Then, she felt
beneath the pillow, and knew that the cockle-shell had been
touched ; and in a moment she leapt from the couch, and
ran to a mirror and saw herself as she was, a full-moon made
to snare the wariest and sit singly high on a throne in the
hearts of men. So, at the sight of her beauty she smiled and
seemed at peace, murmuring still, “I am under the eye of a
man, or I dream.” Now, while she so murmured she arrayed
herself, and took the cockle-shell, and passed through the
ante-room among her women sleeping; and Shibli Bagarag
tracked her till she came to the vault; and she entered it and
walked to the corner from which had hung the dress of Samar-
cand. When she saw it gone her face waxed pale, and she gazed
slowly at all points, muttering, “There is no further doubt.
but that I am under the eye of a man !” Thereupon she ran
hastily from the vault, and passed between the sentinels of
the palace, and saw them where they lay drowsy with in-
toxication : so, she knew that the China jar and the dress of

Samarcand had been used that night, and for no purpose
friendly to her wishes. Then she passed down the palace-
steps, and through the gates of the palace and the city, till
she came to the shore of the sea; there she launched the
cockle-shell and took the wind in her garments, and sat in it,
filling it to overflowing, yet it floated. And Shibli Bagarag
waded to the cockle-shell and took hold of it, and was drawn
along by its motion swiftly through the waters, so that a foam
swept after him; and Goorelka marked the foam. Now,
they had passage over the billows smoothly, and soon the
length of the sea was darkened with two high rocks, and
between them there was a narrow channel of the sea,
roughened with moonlight. So, they sped between the rocks,
and came upon a purple sea, dark-blue overhead, with large
stars leaning to the waves. There was a soft whisperingness
in the breath of the breezes that swung there, and many sails
of charmed ships were seen in momentary gleams, flapping
the mast idly far away. Warm as new milk from the full
udders were the waters of that sea, and figures of fair women
stretched lengthwise with the current, and lifted a head as.
they rushed rolling by. Truly it was enchanted even to the
very bed!


## p. 144 (#158) ############################################

THE LILY OF THE ENCHANTED SEA.
Now, after the cockle-shell had skimmed calmly awhile, it
began to pitch and grew unquiet, and came upon a surging
foam, pale, and with scintillating bubbles. The surges in-
creased in volume, and boiled, hissing as with anger, like
savage animals. Presently, the cockle-shell rose upon one
very lofty swell, and Shibli Bagarag lost hold of it, and lo!
it was overturned and engulfed in the descent of the great
mountain of water, and the Princess Goorelka was immersed
in the depths. She would have sunk, but Shibli Bagarag
caught hold of her, and supported her to the shore by the
strength of his right arm. The shore was one of sand and
shells, their wet cheeks sparkling in the moonlight; over it
hung a promontory, a huge jut of black rock. Now, the
Princess when she landed, seeing not him that supported
her, delayed not to run beneath the rock, and ascended by
steps cut from the base of the rock. And Shibli Bagarag
followed her by winding paths round the rock, till she came
to the highest peak commanding the circle of the Enchanted
Sea, and glimpses of enthralled vessels, and mariners be-
witched on board ; long paths of starlight rippled into the
distant gloom, and the reflection of the moon opposite was as
a wide nuptial sheet of silver on the waters : islands, green
and white, and with soft music floating from their foliage,
sailed slowly to and fro. Surely, to dwell reclining among
the slopes of those islands a man would forfeit Paradise !

THE LILY OF THE ENCHANTED SEA.
145
Now, the Princess, as she stood upon the peak, knew that
she was not alone, and pretended to slip from her footing,
and Shibli Bagarag called out and ran to her; but she
turned in the direction of his voice and laughed, and he
knew he was outwitted. Then, to deceive her, he dropped
from the phial twenty drops round her on the rock, and those
twenty drops became twenty voices, so that she was be-
wildered with their calls, and stopped her ears, and ran from
them, and descended from the eminence nimbly, slipping over
ledges and leaping the abysses. And Shibli Bagarag followed
her, clutching at the trailers and tearing them with him,
letting loose a torrent of stones and earth, till on a sudden
they stood together above a greenswarded basin of the rock
opening to the sea ; and in the middle of the basin, lo! in
stature like a maiden of the mountains, and one that droopeth
her head pensively thinking of her absent lover, the Enchanted
Lily. Wonder knocked at the breast of Shibli Bagarag when
he saw that queenly flower waving its illumined head to the
breeze : he could not retain a cry of rapture. Now, as he
did this the Princess stretched her hand to where he was
and groped a moment, and caught him by the silken dress
and tore in it a great rent, and by the rent he stood revealed
to her. Then said she, “O youth, thou hast done ill to
follow me here, and the danger of it is past computing ;
surely, the motive was a deep one, nought other than the
love of me."
She spoke winningly, sweet words to a luted voice, and
the youth fell upon his knees before her, smitten by her
beauty; and he said, “I followed thee here as I would
follow such loveliness to the gates of doom, O Princess of
Oolb.”
So, she smiled and said playfully, “I will read by thy
hand whether thou be one faithful in love."
Then, she took his hand and sprinkled on it earth and
gravel, and commenced scanning it curiously. As she scanned
it her forehead wrinkled up, and a shot like black lightning

travelled across her countenance, withering its beauty : she
cried in a forced voice, " Aha! it is well, O youth, for
thee and for me that thou lovest me, and art faithful in
love."
Now, the look of the Princess of Oolb and her voice
affrighted the soul of Shibli Bagarag, and he would have
turned from her; but she held him, and went to the Lily,
and emptied into the palm of her hand the dew that was in
the Lily, and raised it to the lips of Shibli Bagarag, bidding
him drink as a pledge for her sake and her love, and to
appease his thirst. As he was about to drink, there fell into
the palm of the Princess from above what seemed a bolt of
storm scattering the dew; and after he had blinked with the
suddenness of the action he looked and beheld the hawk, its
- red eyes inflamed with wrath. · And the hawk screamed
into the ear of Shibli Bagarag, “Pluck up the Lily ere it is
too late, O fool !—the dew was poison ! Pluck it by the
root with thy right hand !”
So, thereat he strode to the Lily, and grasped it, and
pulled with his strength; and the Lily was loosened, and
yielded, and came forth streaming with blood from the bulb
of the root; surely the bulb of the root was a palpitating
heart, yet warm, even as that we have within our bosoms.
Now, from the terror of that sight the Princess hid her
eyes, and shrank away. And the lines of malice, avarice,
and envy seemed aging her at every breath. Then, the
hawk pecked at her three pecks, and perched on a corner
of rock, and called shrilly the name “Karaz !” And the
Genie Karaz came slanting down the night air, like a preying
bird, and stood among them. So, the hawk cried, “See, O
Karaz, the freshness of thy Princess of Oolb;" and the Genie
regarded her till loathing curled his lip, for she grew in ghast-
liness to the colour of a frog, and a frog's face was hers, a.
camel's back, a pelican's throat, the legs of a peacock.
Then the hawk cried, “Is this how ye meet, ye lovers,-
ge that will be wedded ?" And the bawk made his tongue

THE LILY OF THE ENCHANTED SEA. . 117
as a thorn to them. At the last it exclaimed, “Now let us
fight our battle, O Karaz!”
But the Genie said, “Nay, there will come a time for
that, traitress!”
So, the hawk cried, “Thou delayest, till the phial of
Paravid, the hairs of Garraveen, and this Lily, my three helps,
are expended, thinking Aklis, for which we barter them,
striketh but a single blow? That is well! Go, then, and
take thy Princess, and obtain permission of the King of Oolb,
her father, to wed her, O Karaz !”
The hawk whistled with laughter, and the Genie was
stung with its mockeries, and clutched the Princess of Oolb
in a bunch, and arose from the ground with her, slanting up
the night-air like fire, till he was seen high up even as an
angry star reddening the seas beneath.
Now, when he was lost to the eye, Shibli Bagarag drew
a long breath and cried aloud, “The likeness of that Princess
of Oolb in her ugliness to Noorna, my betrothed, is a thing
marvellous, if it be not she herself.” And he reflected, “ Yet
she seemed not to recognise and claim me;” and thought,
“I am bound to her by gratitude, and I should have rescued
her from Karaz, but I know not if it be she. Wullahy! I
am bewildered; I will ask counsel of the hawk.” He
looked to the corner of the rock where the hawk had perched,
but the hawk was gone; so, as he searched for it, his eyes
fell upon the bed of earth where the Lily stood ere he
plucked it, and lo! in the place of the Lily, there was a
damsel dressed in white shining silks, fairer than the en-
chanted flower, straighter than its stalk; her head slightly
drooping, like the moon on a border of the night; her bosom
like the swell of the sea in moonlight; her eyes dark, under
a low arch of darker lashes, like stars on the skirts of storm;
and she was the very dream of loveliness, formed to freeze
with awe, and to inflame with passion. So Shibli Bagarag
gazed at her with adoration, his hands stretched half-way to
her as if to clasp her, fearing she was a vision and would

fade; and the damsel smiled a sweet smile, and lifted her
antelope eyes, and said, “Who am I, and to whom might I
be likened, O youth ?”
And he answered, “Who thou art, O young perfection,
I know not, if not a Houri of Paradise ; but thou art like the
Princess of Oolb, yet lovelier, oh lovelier! And thy voice
is the voice of Noorna, my betrothed; yet purer, sweeter,
younger.”
So, the damsel laughed a laugh like a sudden sweeping of
wild chords of music, and said, “O youth, saw'st thou not
the ascent of Noorna, thy betrothed, gathered in a bunch by
Karaz?”
And he answered, “I saw her; but I knew not, O
damsel of beauty; surely I was bewildered, amazed, without
power to contend with the Genie."
Then, she said, “ Wouldst thou release her ? So kiss me
on the lips, on the eyes, and on the forehead, three kisses
each time; and with the first say, “By the well of Paravid;'
and with the second, “By the strength of Garraveen !' and
with the third, “By the Lily of the Sea !'"
Now, the heart of the youth bounded at her words, and
he went to her, and trembling kissed her all bashfully on
the lips, on the eyes, and on the forehead, saying each time
as she directed. Then, she took him by the hand, and
stepped from the bed of earth, crying joyfully, “ Thanks
be to Allah and the Prophet! Noorna is released from the
sorceries that held her, and powerful.”
So, while he was wondering, she said, “ Knowest thou
not the woman, thy betrothed ?"
He answered, “O damsel of beauty, I am charged with
many feelings; doubts and hopes are mixed in me. Say
first who thou art, and fill my two ears with bliss."
And she said, “I will leave my name to other lips;
surely I am the daughter of the Vizier Feshnavat, betrothed
to a wandering youth,—à barber, who sickened at the
betrothal, and consoled himself with a proverb when he

gave me the kiss of contract, and knew not how with truth
to pay me a compliment."
Now, Shibli Bagarag saw this was indeed Noorna bin
Noorka, his betrothed, and he fell before her in love and
astonishment; but she lifted him to her neck, and embraced
him, saying, “Said I not truly when I said 'I am that I
shall be'? My youth is not as that of Bhanavar the
Beautiful, gained at another's cost, but my own, and
stolen from me by wicked sorceries.” And he cried, “ Tell
me, 0 Noorna, my betrothed, how this matter came to
pass ?”
She said, “On our way to Aklis.”
So, she bade him grasp the Lily, and follow her; and he
followed her down the rock and over the bright shells upon
the sand, admiring her stateliness, her willowy lightness, her
slimness as of the palm-tree. Then, she waded in the water,
and began to strike out with her arms, and swim boldly, —
he likewise ; and presently they came to a current that
hurried them off in its course, and carried them as weeds,
streaming rapidly. He was bearing witness to his faith as a
man that has lost hope of life, when a strong eddy stayed
him, and whirled him from the current into the calm water.
So, he looked for Noorna, and saw her safe beside him
flinging back the wet tresses from her face, that was like the
full moon growing radiant behind a dispersing cloud. And
she said, “ Ask not for the interpretation of wonders in this
sea, for they cluster like dates on a date branch. Surely, to
be with me is enough?”
And she bewitched him in the midst of the waters,
making him oblivious of all save her, so that he thought her
an enchantress, and hugged the golden net of her smiles and
fair flatteries, and swam with an exulting stroke, giving his
breast broadly to the low billows, and shouting verses of
love and delight to her. So while they swam sweetly,
behold, there was seen a pearly shell of flashing crimson,
amethyst, and emerald, that came scudding over the waves

toward them, raised to the wind, fan-shaped, and in its front
two silver seats. When she saw it, Noorna cried, “She has
sent me this, Rabesqurat ! Perchance is she favourable to my
wishes, and this were well !”
Then she swayed in the water sideways, and drew the shell
to her, and the twain climbed into it, and sat each on one of
the silver seats, folded together. In its lightness it was as a
foam-bubble before the wind on the blue water, and bore
them onward airily. At his feet Shibli Bagarag beheld a
stool of carved topaz, and above his head the arch of the
shell was inlaid with wreaths of gems : never was vessel
fairer than that.
Now, while they were speeding over the water, Noorna
said, “The end of this sea is Aklis, and beyond it is the
Koosh. So, while the wind is our helmsman, and we go
circled by the quiet of this sea, I 'll tell thee of myself, if
thou carest to hear.”
And he cried with the ardour of love, “Surely, I would
hear of nought save thyself, O Noorna, and the music of the
happy garden compareth not in sweetness with it. I long
for the freshness of thy voice as the desert camel for the
green spring, O my betrothed !”
So, she said, " And now give ear to the following:”-

AND THIS IS THE STORY OF NOORNA
BIN NOORKA, THE GENIE KARAZ,
AND THE PRINCESS OF OOLB.
Know, that when I was a babe, I lay on my mother's bosom
in the wilderness, and it was the bosom of death. Surely, I
slept and smiled, and dreamed the infant's dream, and knew
not the coldness of the thing I touched. So, were we even
as two dead creatures lying there ; but life was in me, and I
awoke with hunger at the time of feeding, and turned to my
mother, and put up my little mouth to her for nourishment,
and sucked her, but nothing came. So, I cried, and commenced
chiding her, and after a while it was as decreed, that
certain horsemen of a troop passing through the wilderness
beheld me, and seeing my distress and the helpless being I
was, their hearts were stirred, and they were mindful of what
the poet says concerning succour given to the poor, helpless,
and innocent of this world, and took me up, and mixed for

and bore me with them, after they had paid funeral rites to
the body of my mother.
Now, the rose-bud showeth if the rose-tree be of the wilds
or of the garden, and the chief of that troop seeing me born
to the uses of gentleness, carried me in his arms with him to
his wife, and persuaded her that was childless to make me
the child of their adoption. So I abode with them during

the period of infancy and childhood, caressed and cared for,
as is said :
The flower a stranger's hand may gather,
Strikes root into the stranger's breast;
Affection is our mother, father,
Friend, and of cherishers the best.
And I loved them as their own child, witting not but that I
was their child, till on a day while I played among some
children of my years, the daughter of the King of Oolb
passed by us on a mule, with her slaves and drawn swords,
and called to me, “Thou little castaway !” and had me
brought to her, and peered upon my face in a manner that
frightened me, for I was young. Then she put me down
from the neck of her mule where she had seated me, saying,
“Child of a dead mother and a runaway father, what need I
fear from thy like, and the dreams of a love-sick Genie ?"
So she departed, but I forgot not her words, and dwelt upon
them, and grew fevered with them, and drooped. Now, when
he saw my bloom of health gone, heaviness on my feet, the
light hollowed from my eyes, my benefactor, Ravaloke—he
that I had thought my father—took me between his knees,
and asked me what it was and the cause of my ailing; and
I told him.
Then, said he, “This is so : thou art not my child; but I
love thee as mine, O my little Desert-flower; and why the
Princess should fancy fear of thee I like not to think; but
fear thou her, for she is a mask of wiles and a vine trailing
over pitfalls; such a sorceress the world knoweth not as
Goorelka of Oolb.”
Now, I was penetrated by what he said, and ceased to be
a companion to them that loved childish games and romps,
and meditated by myself in gardens and closets, feigning
sleep when the elder ones discoursed, that I might learn
something of this mystery, and all that was spoken perplexed
me more, as the sage declareth :
Who in a labyrinth wandereth without clue,
More that he wandereth doth himself undo.

Though I was quick as the quick-eyed falcon, I discovered
nought, flying ever at false game,-
A follower of misleading beams,
A cheated soul, the mock of dreams.
At times I thought that it was the King of Oolb was my
father, and plotted to come in his path; and there were kings
and princes of far countries whom I sought to encounter,
that they might claim me; but none claimed me. O my
betrothed, few gave me love beside Ravaloke, and when the
wife that he cherished died, he solely, for I was lost in way-
wardness and the slave of moody imaginings. 'T is said :
If thou the love of the world for thyself wouldst gain, mould thy
breast
Liker the world to become, for its like the world loveth best ;
and this was not I then.
Now, the sons and daughters of men are used to celebrate
the days of their birth with gifts and rejoicings, but I could
only celebrate that day which delivered me from death into
the hands of Ravaloke, as none knew my birth-hour. When
it was the twelfth return of this event, Ravaloke, my heart's
father, called me to him and pressed in my hand a glittering
coin, telling me to buy with it in the bazaars what I would.
So I went forth, attended by a black slave, after the mid-
noon, for I was eager to expend my store, and cared not for
the great heat. Scarcely had we passed the cheese-market
and were hurrying on to shops of the goldsmiths and
jewellers, when I saw an old man, a beggar, in a dirty yellow
turban and pieced particoloured cloth-stuff, and linen in rags
his other gear. So lean was he, and looked so weak that I
wondered he did other than lay his length on the ground;
and as he asked me for alms his voice had a piteousness that
made me to weep, and I punished my slave for seeking to
drive him away, and gave my one piece of gold into his
hand. Then he asked me what I required of him in ex-
change, and I said, “What can a poor old man that is a

were my purchaeould I buy
beggar give ?” He laughed, and asked me then what I had
intended to buy with that piece of money. So, beginning to
regret the power that was gone from me of commanding with
my gold piece this and that fine thing, I mused, and said,
“Truly, a blue dress embroidered with gold, and a gold
crown, and gold bracelets set with turquoise stones,—these,
and toys; but could I buy in this city a book of magic, that
were my purchase.”
The old fellow smiled, and said to my black slave, “ And
thou, hadst thou this coin, what were thy purchase there-
with ? "
He, scoffing the old beggar, answered, “A plaister for
sores as broad as my back, and a camel's hump, O thou old
villain !"
The old man grunted in his chest, and said, "Thou art
but a camel thyself, to hinder a true Mussulman from passing
in peace down a street of Oolb; so 't were a good purchase
and a fitting: know'st thou what is said of the blessing given
by them that receive a charity?
T is the fertilizing dew that streameth after the sun,
Strong as the breath of Allah to bless life well begun.'
So is my blessing on the little damsel, and she shall have her
wish, wullahy, thou black face ! and thou thine.”
This spake the old man, and hobbled off while my slave
was jeering him. So, I strolled through the bazaars and
thought no more of the old man's words, and longed to
purchase a hundred fineries, and came to the confectioner's,
and smelt the smell of his musk-scented sweetmeats and
lemon sweets and sugared pistachios that are delicious to
crunch between the teeth. My mouth watered, and I said
to my slave, “O Kadrab, a coin, though 't were small, would
give us privilege in yonder shop to select, and feast, and
approve the skill of the confectioner.”
He grinned, and displayed in his black fist a petty coin
of exchange, but would not let me have it till I had sworn

155
to give no more away to beggars. So even as we were
hurrying into the shop, another old beggar wretcheder than
the first fronted me, and I was moved, and forgot my promise
to Kadrab, and gave him the money. Then was Kadrab
wroth, and kicked the old beggar with his fore-foot, lifting
him high in air, and lo! he did not alight, but rose over the
roofs of the houses and beyond the city, till he was but a
speck in the blue of the sky above. So, Kadrab bit his fore-
finger amazed, and glanced at his foot, and at what was visible
of the old beggar-man, and again at his foot, thinking but of
what he had done with it, and the might manifested in that
kick, fool that he was ! All the way homeward he kept
scanning the sky and lifting his foot aloft, and I saw him
bewildered with a strange conceit, as the poet has exclaimed
in his scorn :
Oh, world diseased! oh, race empirical !
Where fools are the fathers of every miracle !"
Now, when I was in my chamber, what saw I there but
a dress of very costly blue raiment with gold-work broidery
and a lovely circlet of gold, and gold bracelets set with stones
of turquoise, and a basket of gold woven wire, wherein were
toys, wondrous ores--soldiers that cut off each other's heads
and put them on again, springing antelopes, palm-trees that
turned to fountains, and others; and lo ! a book in red bind-
ing, with figures on it and clasps of gold, a great book! So,
I clapped my hands joyfully, crying, “The old beggar has
done it !” and robed myself in the dress, and ran forth to tell
Ravaloke. As I ran by a window looking on the inner court,
I saw below a crowd of all the slaves of Ravaloke round one
that was seeking to escape from them, and 't was Kadrab with
a camel's hump on his back, and a broad brown plaister over
it, the wretch howling, peering across his shoulder, and trying
to bolt from his burden, as a horse that would run from his
rider. Then I saw that Kadrab also had his wish, his camel's
hump, and thought, “The old beggar, what was he but a

Genie?” Surely Ravaloke caressed me when he heard of the
adventure, and what had befallen Kadrab was the jest of the
city; but for me I spared little time away from that book, and
studied in it incessantly the ways and windings of magic, till
I could hold communication with Genii, and wield charms to
summon them, and utter spells that subdue them, discovering
the haunts of talismans that enthral Afrites and are powerful
among men. There was that Kadrab coming to me daily
to call out in the air for the old beggarman to rid him of
his hump; and he would waste hours looking up into the
sky moodily for him, and cursing the five toes of his foot,
for he doubted not the two beggars were one, and that he was
punished for the kick, and lamented it direly, saying in the
thick of his whimperings, “I'd give the foot that did it to be
released from my hump, O my fair mistress.” So, I pitied
him, and made a powder and a spell, and my first experiment
in magic was to relieve Kadrab of his hump, and I succeeded
in loosening it, and it came away from him, and sank into
the ground of the garden where we stood. So, I told
Kadrab to say nothing of this, but the idle-pated fellow
blabbed it over the city, and it came to the ears of Goorelka.
Then, she sent for me to visit her, and by the advice of
Ravaloke I went, and she fondled me, and sought to get
at the depth of my knowledge by a spell that tieth every
faculty save the tongue, and it is the spell of vain longing.
Now, because I baffled her arts she knew me more cunning
than I seemed, and as night advanced she affected to be
possessed with pleasure in me, and took me in her arms
and sought to fascinate me, and I heard her mutter once,
“Shall I doubt the warning of Karaz ?” So, presently she
said, “ Come with me;" and I went with her under the
curtain of that apartment into another, a long saloon,
wherein were couches round a fountain, and beyond it
an aviary lit with lamps : when we were there she whistled,
and immediately there was a concert of birds, a wondrous
accord of exquisite piping, and she leaned on a couch

157
and took me by her to listen ; sweet and passionate was
the harmony of the birds ; but I let not my faculties lull,
and observed that round the throat of every bird was
a ringed mark of gold and stamps of divers gems similar
in colour to a ring on the forefinger of her right hand, which
she dazzled my sight with as she flashed it. When we had
listened a long hour to this music, the Princess gazed
on me as if to mark the effect of a charm, and I saw dis-
appointment on her lovely face, and she bit her lip and
looked spiteful, saying, “Thou art far gone in the use of
magic, and wary, 0 girl !” Then she laughed unnaturally,
and called slaves to bring in sweet drinks to us, and I drank
with her, and became less wary, and she fondled me more,
calling me tender names, heaping endearments on me; and
as the hour of the middle-night approached I was losing
all suspicion in deep languor, and sighed at the song of
the birds, the long love-song, and dozed awake with eyes
half shut. I felt her steal from me, and continued still
motionless without alarm : so was I mastered. What hour
it was or what time had passed I cannot say, when a bird
that was chained on a perch before me—a very quaint bird,
with a topknot awry, and black, heavy bill, and ragged
gorgeousness of plumage—the only object between my
lids and darkness, suddenly, in the midst of the singing,
let loose a hoarse laugh that was followed by peals of
laughter from the other birds. Thereat I started up,
and beheld the Princess standing over a brazier, and
she seized a slipper from her foot and flung it at the
bird that had first laughed, and struck him off his perch,
and went to him and seized him and shook him, crying,
“ Dare to laugh again !” and he kept clearing his throat and
trying to catch the tune he had lost, pitching a high note
and a low note; but the marvel of this laughter of the
bird wakened me thoroughly, and I thanked the bird in my
soul, and said to Goorelka, “More wondrous than their
singing, this laughter, O Princess !".

She would not speak till she had beaten every bird in
the aviary, and then said in the words of the poet:
Shall they that deal in magic match degrees of wonder ?
From the bosom of one cloud comes the lightning and the thunder.
Then said she, “O Noorna ! I'll tell thee truly my intent,
which was to enchant thee; but I find thee wise, so let us
join our powers, and thou shalt become mighty as a
sorceress.”
Now, Ravaloke had said to me, “Her friendship is fire,
her enmity frost; so be cold to the former, to the latter hot,”
and I dissembled and replied, “ Teach me, O Princess !”
So, she asked me what I could do. Could I plant a
mountain in the sea and people it? could I anchor a purple
cloud under the sun and live there a year with them I de-
lighted in ? could I fix the eyes of the world upon one head
and make the nations bow to it; change men to birds, fishes
to men; and so on-a hundred sorceries that I had never
attempted and dreamed not of. O my betrothed! I had
never offended Allah by a misuse of my powers. When I
told her, she cried, “Thou art then of a surety she that's
fitted for the custody of the Lily of the Light, so come with
me.”
Now, I had heard of the Lily, even this thou holdest-
may its influence be unwithering !-and desired to see it.
So, she led me from the palace to the shore of the sea, and
flung a cockle-shell on the waters, and seated herself in it
with me in her lap; and we scudded over the waters, and
entered this Enchanted Sea, and stood by the Lily. Then, I
that loved flowers undertook the custody of this one, knowing
not the consequences and the depth of her wiles. 'T is truly
said:
The overwise themselves hoodwink,
For simple eyesight is a modest thing :
. They on the black abysm's brink
Smile, and but when they fall bitterly think,
What difference 'twist the fool and me, Creation's King ?

Nevertheless for awhile nothing evil resulted, and I had
great joy in the flower, and tended it with exceeding watch-
fulness, and loved it, so that I was brought in my heart to
thank the Princess and think well of her.
Now, one summer eve as Ravaloke rested under the shade
of his garden palm, and I studied beside him great volumes
of magic, it happened that after I had read certain pages I
closed one of the books marked on the cover “ Alif,” and
shut the clasp louder than I intended, so that he who was
dozing started up, and his head was in the sloped sun in an
instant, and I observed the shadow of his head lengthen out
along the grass-plot towards the mossed wall, and it shot up
the wall, darkening it—then drawing back and lessening,
then darting forth like a beast of darkness irritable for prey.
I was troubled, for whatso is seen while the volume Alif is
in use hath a portent; but the discovery of what this might
be baffled me. So, I determined to watch events, and it was
not many days ere Ravaloke, who was the leader of the
armies of the King of Oolb, was called forth to subdue
certain revolted tributaries of the King, and at my entreaty
took me with him, and I saw battles and encounters lasting
a day's length. Once we were encamped in a fruitful country
by a brook running with a bright eye between green banks,
and I that had freedom and the password of the camp
wandered down to it, and refreshed my forehead with its
coolness. So, as I looked under the falling drops, lo! on the
opposite bank the old beggar that had given me such fair
return for my alms and Kadrab his hump! I heard him
call, “This night is the key to the mystery,” and he was
gone. Every incantation I uttered was insufficient to bring
him back. Surely, I hurried to the tents and took no sleep,
watching zealously by the tent of Ravaloke, crouched in its
shadow. About the time of the setting of the moon I heard
footsteps approach the tent within the circle of the guard,
and it was a youth that held in his hand naked steel. When
he was by the threshold of the tent, I rose before him and

beheld the favourite of Ravaloke, even the youth he had
destined to espouse me ; so I reproached him, and he wept,
denying not the intention he had to assassinate Ravaloke,
and when his soul was softened he confessed to me, “'T was
that I might win the Princess Goorelka, and she urged me to
it, promising the King would promote me to the vacant post
of Ravaloke."
Then, I said to him, “Lov'st thou Goorelka ?”
And he answered, “ Yea, though I know my doom in
loving her; and that it will be the doom of them now piping
to her pleasure and denied the privilege of laughter."
· So, I thought, “Oh, cruel sorceress! the birds are men !”
And as I mused, my breast melted with pity at their desire
to laugh, and the little restraint they had upon themselves
notwithstanding her harshness; for could they think of their
changed condition and folly without laughter ? and the folly
that sent them fresh mates in misery was indeed matter for
laughter, fed to fulness by constant meditation on the perch.
Meantime, I uncharmed the youth and bade him retire
quickly; but as he was going, he said, “Beware of the Genie
Karaz!” Then I held him back, and after a parley he told
me what he had heard the Princess say, and it was that Karaz
had seen me and sworn to possess me for my beauty.
“ Strangely smiled Goorelka when she spake that,” said he.
Now, the City of Oolb fronts the sea, and behind it is a
mountain and a wood, where the King met Ravaloke on his
return victorious over the rebels. So, to escape the eye of
the King I parted with Ravaloke, and sought to enter the
city by a circuitous way; but the paths wound about and
zigzagged, and my slaves suffered nightfall to surprise us in
the entanglements of the wood. I sent them in different
directions to strike into the main path, retaining Kadrab at
the bridle of my mule; but that creature now began to
address me in a familiar tone, and he said something of love
for me that enraged me, so that I hit him a blow. Then
came from him sounds like the neighing of mares, and lo!

me into a outh of a caverith me from When on a
he seized me and rose with me in the air, and I thought the
very heavens were opening to that black beast, when on a
sudden he paused, and shot down with me from heights of
the stars to the mouth of a cavern by the Putrid Sea, and
dragged me into a cavern greatly illuminated, hung like a
palace chamber, and supported on pillars of shining jasper.
Then, I fell upon the floor in a swoon, and awaking saw
Kadrab no longer, but in his place a Genie. O my soul, thou
hast seen him !-I thought at once, “'t is Karaz!” and when
he said to me, “This is thy abode, O lady! and I he that
have sworn to possess thee from the hour I saw thee in the
chamber of Goorelka,” then was I certain 't was Karaz. So,
collecting the strength of my soul, I said, in the words of
the poet :
“Woo not a heart preoccupied !
What thorn is like a loathing bride ?
Mark ye the shrubs how they turn from the sea,
The sea's rough whispers shun ?
But like the sun of heaven be,
And every flower will open wide.
Woo with the shining patience we
Beheld in heaven's sun."
Then, he sang :
Exquisite lady! name the smart
That fills thy heart.
Thou art the foot and I the worm :
Prescribe the Term.
Finding him compliant, I said, "O great Genie, truly the
search of my life has been to discover him that is my father,
and how I was left in the wilderness. There is no peace for
me, nor understanding the word of love, till I hear by whom
I was left a babe on the bosom of a dead mother."
He exclaimed, and his eyes twinkled, “ 'T is that? that
shalt thou know in a span of time. O my mistress, hast thou
seen the birds of Goorelka ? Thy father Feshnavat is among
them, perched like a bird.”

So, I cried, “And tell me how he may be disenchanted.”
He said, “Swear first to be mine unreluctantly."
Then, I said, “What is thy oath ?”
He answered, “I swear, when I swear, by the Identical.”
Thereupon, I questioned him concerning the Identical,
what it was; and he, not suspecting, revealed to me the
mighty hair in his head now in the head of Shagpat, even
that. So I swore by that to give myself to the possessor of
the Identical, and flattered him. Then said he, “O lovely
damsel, I am truly one of the most powerful of the Genii;
yet am I in bondage to that sorceress Goorelka by reason of
a ring she holdeth; and could I get that ring from her and
be slave to nothing mortal an hour, I could light creation as
a torch, and broil the inhabitants of earth at one fire.”
I thought, “That ring is known to me!" And he con-
tinued, “Surely I cannot assist thee in this work other than
by revealing the means of disenchantment, and it is to keep
the birds laughing uninterruptedly an hour; then are they
men again, and take the forms of men that are laughers—I
know not why."
So, I cried, “'T is well ! carry me back to Oolb.”
Then, the Genie lifted me into the air, and ceased not
speeding rapidly through it, till I was on the roof of the
house of Ravaloke. Osweet youth ! moon of my soul! from
that time to the disenchantment of Feshnavat, I pored over
my books trying experiments in magic, dreadful ones, hunting
for talismans to countervail Goorelka; but her power was
great, and 't was not in me to get her away from the birds
one hour to free them. On a certain occasion I had stolen
to them, and kept them laughing with stories of man to
within an instant of the hour; and they were laughing
exultingly with the easy happy laugh of them that perceive
deliverance sure, when she burst in and beat them even to
the door of death. I saw too in her eyes, that glowed like
the eyes of wild cats in the dark, she suspected me, and I

called Allah to aid the just cause against the sinful, and
prepared to war with her.
Now, the poet says truly,-
The battle of the righteous is battle half gain’d,
For Allah's the cause with no fleck of Self stain'd.
And my desire, which was to liberate my father and his
fellows in tribulation, I knew pure, and had no fear of the
sequel, as is again declared :
Fear nought so much as Fear itself; for arm'd with Fear the Foe
Finds passage to the vital part, and strikes a double blow.
So, one day as I leaned from my casement looking on the
garden seaward, I saw a strange red and yellow-feathered bird
that flew to the branch of a citron-tree opposite, with a ring
in its beak; and the bird was singing, and with every note
the ring dropped from its bill, and it descended swiftly in an
arrowy slant downward, and seized it ere it reached the
ground, and commenced singing afresh. When I had marked
this to happen many times, I thought, “How like is this bird
to an innocent soul possessed of magic and using its powers !
Lo, it seeketh still to sing as one of the careless, and cannot
relinquish the ring and be as the careless, and between
the two there is neither peace for it nor pleasure.” Now,
while my eyes were on the pretty bird, dwelling on it, I saw
it struck suddenly by an arrow beneath the left wing, and
the bird fluttered to my bosom and dropped in it the ring
from its beak. Then it sprang weakly, and sought to fly and
soar, and fluttered; but a blue film lodged over its eyes, and
its panting was quickly ended. So, I looked at the ring and
knew it for that one I had noted on the finger of Goorelka.
Red blushed my bliss, and 't was revealed to me that the
bird was of the birds of the Princess that had escaped from
her with the ring. I buried the bird, weeping for it, and
flew to my books, and as I read a glow stole over me. O my

betrothed, eyes of my soul! I read that the possessor of that
ring was mistress of the marvellous hair which is a magnet
to the homage of men, so that they crowd and crush and
hunger to adore it, even the Identical! This was the power
that peopled the aviary of Goorelka, and had well-nigh con-
quered all the resistance of my craft.
Now, while I read there arose a hubbub and noise in the
outer court, and shrieks of slaves. The noise approached with
rapid strides, and before I could close my books Goorelka
burst in upon me, crying, “Noorna ! Noorna !” Wild and
haggard was her head, and she rushed to my books and saw
them open at the sign of the ring : then began our combat.
She menaced me as never mortal was menaced. Rapid light-
ning-flashes were her transformations, and she was a serpent,
a scorpion, a lizard, a lioness in succession, but I leapt perpetu-
ally into fresh rings of fire and of witched water; and at
the fiftieth transformation, she fell on the floor exhausted, a
shuddering heap. Seeing that, I ran from her to the aviary
in her palace, and hurried over a story of men to the birds,
that rocked them on their perches with chestquakes of irre-
sistible laughter. Then flew I back to the Princess, and she
still puffing on the floor, commenced wheedling and begging
the ring of me, stinting no promises. At last she cried,
“Girl! what is this ring to thee without beauty? Thy beauty
is in my keeping."
And I exclaimed, “How? how?” smitten to the soul.
She answered, “Yea; and I can wear it as my own, add-
ing it to my own, when thou ’rt a hag !”
My betrothed ! I was on the verge of giving her the ring
for this secret, when a violent remote laughter filled the inner
hollow of my ears, and it increased, till the Princess heard
it; and now the light of my casement was darkened with
birds, the birds of Goorelka, laughing as on a wind of laughter.
So, I opened to them, and they darted in, laughing all of
them, till I could hold out no longer, and the infection of
laughter seized me, and I rolled with it; and the Princess,

she too laughed a hyæna-laugh under a cat's grin, and we all
of us remained in this wise some minutes, laughing the breath
out of our bodies, as if death would take us. Whoso in the
City of Oolb heard us, the slaves, the people, and the King,
laughed, knowing not the cause. This day is still remembered
in Oolb as the day of laughter. Now, at a stroke of the hour
the laughter ceased, and I saw in the chamber a crowd of
youths and elders of various ranks; but their visages were
become long and solemn as that of them that have seen a dark
experience. 'T is certain they laughed little in their lives
from that time, and the muscles of their cheeks had rest. So,
I caught down my veil, and cried to the Princess, "My father
is among these ; point him out to me.”
Ere she replied one stepped forth, even Feshnavat, my
father, and called me by name, and knew me by a spot on
the left arm, and made himself known to me, and told me the
story of my dead mother, how she had missed her way from
the caravan in the desert, and he searching her was set upon
by robbers, and borne on their expeditions. Nothing said
he of the sorceries of Goorelka, and I, not wishing to provoke
the Princess, suffered his dread to exist. So, I kissed him,
and bowed my head to him, and she fled from the sight of
innocent happiness. Then took I the ring, and summoned
Karaz, and ordered him to reinstate all those princes and chiefs
and officers in their possessions and powers, on what part of
earth soever that might be. Never till I stood as the Lily
and thy voice sweetened the name of love in my ears, heard
I aught of delicate delightfulness, like the sound of their
gratitude. Many wooed me to let them stay by me and guard
me, and do service all their lives to me; but this I would not
allow, and though they were fair as moons, some of them, I
responded not to their soft glances, speaking calmly the word
of farewell, for I was burdened with other thoughts.
Now, when the Genie had done my bidding, he returned
to me joyfully. My soul sickened to think myself his by
promise; but I revolved the words of my promise, and

in them a loophole of escape. So, when he claimed me, I
said, “Ay! ay! lay thy head in my lap," as if my mind
treasured it. Then, he lay there, and revealed to me his plans
for the destruction of men. “Or," said he, “they shall be
our slaves and burden-beasts, for there 's now no restraint on
me, now thou art mistress of the ring, and mine." There-
upon his imagination swelled, and he saw his evil will
enthroned, and the hopes of men beneath his heel, crying,
“And the more I crush them the thicker they crowd, for the
Identical compelleth their very souls to adore in spite of
distaste.”
Then, said I, “Tell me, O Genie ! is the Identical subser-
vient to me in another head save thine ?”
He answered, “Nay! in another head 't is a counteraction
to the power of the Ring, the Ring powerless over it.”
And I said, “Must it live in a head, the Identical ?"
Cried he, “Woe to what else holdeth it !”
So, I whispered in his hairy, pointed, red ear, “Sleep!
sleep!” and lulled him with a song, and he slept, being
weary with my commissioning. Then, I bade Feshnavat, my
father, fetch me one of my books of magic, and read in it of
the discovery of the Identical by means of the Ring; and I
took the Ring and hung it on a hair of my own head over
the head of the Genie, and saw one of the thin lengths begin
to twist and dart and writhe, and shift lustres as a creature
in anguish. So, I put the Ring on my forefinger, and turned
the hair round and round it, and tugged. Lo, with a noise
that stunned me, the hair came out! O my betrothed, what
shrieks and roars were those with which the Genie awoke,
finding himself bare of the Identical ! Oolb heard them, and
the sea foamed like the mouth of madness, as the Genie sped
thunder-like over it, following me in mid-air. Such a flight
was that! Now, I found it not possible to hold the Identical,
for it twisted and stung, and was nigh slipping from me while
I flew. I saw white on a corner of the Desert, a city, and I
descended on it by the shop of a clothier that sat quietly by

his goods and stuffs, thinking of fate less than of kabobs and
stews and rare seasonings. That city hath now his name.
Wullahy, had I not then sown in his head that hair which
he weareth yet, how had I escaped Karaz, and met thee?
Wondrous are the decrees of Providence! Praise be to Allah
for them! So the Genie, when he found himself baffled by
me, and Shagpat with the mighty hair in his head, the
Identical, he yelled, and fetched Shagpat a slap that sent him
into the middle of the street; but Kadza screamed after him,
and there was immediately such lamentation in the city about
Shagpat, and such tearing of hair about him, that I perceived
at once the virtue that was in the Identical. As for Karaz,
finding his claim as possessor of the Identical no more valid,
he vanished, and has been my rebellious slave since, till thou,
O my betrothed, mad'st me spend him in curing thy folly on
the horse Garraveen, and he escaped from my circles beyond
the dominion of the Ring ; yet had he his revenge, for I that
was keeper of the Lily, had, I now learned ruefully, a bond
of beauty with it, and whatever was a stain to one withered
the other. Then that sorceress Goorelka stole my beauty
from me by sprinkling a blight on the petals of the fair
flower, and I became as thou first saw'st me. But what am
I as I now am ? Blissful ! blissful! Surely I grew humble
with the loss of beauty, and by humility wise, so that I
assisted Feshnavat to become Vizier by the Ring, and watched
for thy coming to shave Shagpat, as a star watcheth; for 't is
written, “A barber alone shall be shearer of the Identical ;”
and he only, my betrothed, hath power to plant it in Aklis,
where it groweth as a pillar, bringing due reverence to
Aklis.

Now, when Noorna bin Noorka had made an end of her nar-
ration, she folded her hands and was mute awhile; and to
the ear of Shibli Bagarag it seemed as if a sweet instrument
had on a sudden ceased luting. So, as he leaned, listening
for her voice to recommence, she said quickly, “See yonder
fire on the mountain's height !”
He looked, and saw a great light on the summit of a lofty
mountain before them.
Then said she, “That is Aklis ! and it is ablaze, knowing
a visitant near. Tighten now the hairs of Garraveen about
thy wrist; touch thy lips with the waters of Paravid; hold
before thee the Lily, and make ready to enter the mountain.
Lo, my betrothed, thou art in possession of the three means
that melt opposition, and the fault is thine if thou fail.”
He did as she directed; and they were taken on a tide and
advanced rapidly to the mountain, so that the waters smacked
and crackled beneath the shell, covering it with silver shower-
ing arches of glittering spray. Then the fair beams of the
moon became obscured, and the twain reddened with the re-
flection of the fire, and the billows waxed like riotous flames;
and presently the shell rose upon the peak of many waves
swollen to one, and looking below, they saw in the scarlet
abyss of waters at their feet a monstrous fish, with open jaws
and one baleful eye; and the fish was lengthy as a caravan
winding through the desert, and covered with fiery scales.
Shibli Bagarag heard the voice of Nocrna shriek affrightedly,

“Karaz !” and as they were sliding on the down slope, she
stood upright in the shell, pronouncing rapidly some words
in magic; and the shell closed upon them both, pressing
them together, and writing darkness on their very eyeballs.
So, while they were thus, they felt themselves gulped in, and
borne forward with terrible swiftness, they knew not where,
like one that hath a dream of sinking; and outside the shell
à rushing, gurgling noise, and a noise as of shouting
multitudes, and muffled multitudes muttering complaints and
yells and querulous cries, told them they were yet speeding
through the body of the depths in the belly of the fish.
Then, there came a shock, and the shell was struck with
light, and they were sensible of stillness without motion.
Then, a blow on the shell shivered it to fragments, and they
were blinded with seas of brilliancy on all sides from lamps
and tapers and crystals, cornelians and gems of fiery lustre,
liquid lights and flashing mirrors, and eyes of crowding
damsels, bright ones. So, when they had risen, and could
bear to gaze on the insufferable splendour, they saw sitting
on a throne of coral and surrounded by slaves with scimitars,
a fair Queen, with black eyes, kindlers of storms, torches in
the tempest, and with floating tresses, crowned with a circlet
of green-spiked precious stones and masses of crimson weed
with flaps of pearl ; and she was robed with a robe of amber,
and had saffron sandals, loose silvery-silken trousers tied in at
the ankle, the ankle white as silver; wonderful was the
quivering of rays from the jewels upon her when she but
moved a finger! Now, as they stood with their hands across
their brows, she cried out, “O ye traversers of my sea ! how
is this, that I am made to thank Karaz for a sight of ye?”
And Noorna bin Noorka answered, “Surely, O Queen
Rabesqurat, the haven of our voyage was Aklis, and we feared
delay, seeing the fire of the mountain ablaze with expectations
of us.”
Then, the Queen cried angrily, “'Tis well thou hadst wit
to close the shell, O Noorna, or there would have been delay

indeed. Say, is not the road to Aklis through my palace ?
And it is the road thousands travel.”
So, Noorna bin Noorka said, “ O Queen, this do they ;
but are they of them that reach Aklis ? ”
And the Queen cried violently, purpling with passion,
“ This to me! when I helped ye to the plucking of the Lily!
Now, the Queen muttered an imprecation, and called the
name “ Abarak !” and lo, a door opened in one of the pillars
of jasper leading from the throne, and there came forth a
little man, humped, with legs like bows, and arms reaching
to his feet; in his hand a net weighted with leaden weights.
So the Queen levelled her finger at Noorna, and he spun
the net above her head, and dropped it on her shoulder, and
dragged her with him to the pillar. When Shibli Bagarag
saw that, the world darkened to him, and he rushed upon
A barak; but Noorna called swiftly in his ear, “ Wait! wait !
Thou by thy spells art stronger than all here save Abarak.
Be true! Remember the seventh pillar !” Then, with a
spurn from the hand of Abarak, the youth fell back senseless
at the feet of the Queen.
Now, with the return of consciousness his hearing was.
bewitched with strange delicious melodies, the touch of
stringed instruments, and others breathed into softly as by
the breath of love, delicate, tender, alive with enamoured
bashfulness. Surely, the soul that heard them dissolved
like a sweet in the goblet, mingling with so much ecstasy of
sound ; and those melodies filling the white cave of the ear
were even at once to drown the soul in delightfulness and
buoy it with bliss, as a heavy-leaved flower is withered and
refreshed by sun and dews. Surely, the youth ceased not to
listen, and oblivion of cares and aught other in this life, save
that hidden luting and piping, pillowed his drowsy head.
At last there was a pause, and it seemed every maze of
music had been wandered through. Opening his eyes
hurriedly, as with the loss of the music his own breath had
gone likewise, he beheld a garden golden with the light of
n the gobodies filling tbal in delig

lamps hung profusely from branches and twigs of trees by
the glowing cheeks of fruits, apple and grape, pomegranate
and quince; and he was reclining on a bank piled with
purple cushions, his limbs clad in the richest figured silks,
fringed like the ends of clouds round the sun, with amber
fringes. He started up, striving to recall the confused
memory of his adventures and what evil had befallen him,
and he would have struggled with the vision of these glories,
but it mastered him with the strength of a potent drug, so
that the very name of his betrothed was forgotten by him,
and he knew not whither he would, or the thing he wished
for. Now, when he had risen from the soft green bank
that was his couch, lo, at his feet a damsel weeping! So, he
lifted her by the hand, and she arose and looked at him, and
began plaining of love and its tyrannies, softening him,
already softened. Then said she, “ What I suffer there is
another, lovelier than I, suffering ; thou the cause of it, O
cruel youth !”
So, he said, “How, O damsel ? what of my cruelty ?
Surely, I know nothing of it.”
But she exclaimed, “Ah, worse to feign forgetfulness !”.
Now, he was bewildered at the words of the damsel, and
followed her leading till they entered a dell in the garden
canopied with foliage, and beyond it a green rise, and on the
rise a throne. So he looked earnestly, and beheld thereon
Queen Rabesqurat, she sobbing, her dark hair pouring in
streams from the crown on her head. Seeing him, she
cleared her eyes, and advanced to meet him timidly and
with hesitating steps ; but he shrank from her, and the
Queen shrieked with grief, crying, “Is there in this cold
heart no relenting ?”.
Then she said to him winningly, and in a low voice, “O
youth, my husband, to whom I am a bride !"
So he marvelled, saying, “This is a game, for indeed I am
no husband, neither have I a bride .... yet have I con-
fused memory of some betrothal ..."

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Thereupon, she cried, “Said I not so ? and I the betrothed."
Still, he exclaimed, “I cannot think it! Wullahy, it
were a wonder!”
So, she said, “Consider how a poor youth of excellent
proportions came to a flourishing Court before one, a
widowed Queen, and she cast eyes of love on him, and gave
him rule over her and all that was hers when he had achieved
a task, and they were wedded. Oh, the bliss of it! Knit
together with bond and a writing; and these were the
dominions, I the Queen, woe's me!—thou the youth !"
Now, he was wiled by the enchantments of the Queen,
caught in the snare of her beguilings; and he let her lead
him to a seat beside her on the throne, and sat there awhile
in the midst of feastings, mazed, thinking, “What life have
I lived before this, if the matter be as I behold ?" thinking,
“T is true I have had visions of a widowed queen, and I a
poor youth that came to her court, and espoused her, sitting
in the vacant seat beside her, ruling a realm ; but it was a
dream, a dream,—yet, wah! here is she, here am I, yonder
my dominions!” Then he thought, “I will solve it!” So,
on a sudden he said to her beside him, “O Queen, sovereign
of hearts ! enlighten me as to a perplexity.”
She answered, “The voice of my lord is music in the ear
of the bride."
Then said he, in the tone of one doubting realities, “O
fair Queen, is there truly now such a one as Shagpat in the
world ?”
She laughed at his speech and the puzzled appearance of
his visage, replying, “Surely there liveth one, Shagpat by
name in the world ; strange is the history of him, his friends,
and enemies; and it would bear recital.”
Then he said, “And one, the daughter of a Vizier, Vizier
to the King in the City of Shagpat?”
Thereat, she shook her head, saying, “I know nought of
that one."
Now, Shibli Bagarag was mindful of his thwackings; and

in this the wisdom of Noorna is manifest, that the sting of
them yet chased away doubts of illusion regarding their
having been, as the poet says,
If thou wouldst fix remembrance—thwack!
'T is that oblivion controls,
I care not if 't be on the back,
Or on the soles.
He thought, “Wah! yet feel I the thong, and the hiss of it
as of the serpent in the descent, and the smack of it as of the
mouth of satisfaction in its contact with tender regions.
This, wullahy! was no dream.” Nevertheless, he was
ashamed to allude thereto before the Queen, and he said, “O
my mistress, another question, one only! This Shagpat—is
he shaved ?”
So, she said, “ Clean shorn !”
Quoth he, astonished, grief-stricken, with drawn lips, “ By
which hand, chosen above men ?”
And she exclaimed, “O thou witty one that feignest not
to know! Wullahy! by this hand of thine, O my lord and
king, daring that it is; dexterous ! surely so! And the
shaving of Shagpat was the task achieved,-I the dower of
it, and the rich reward.”
Now, he was meshed yet deeper in the net of her
subtleties, and by her calling him “lord and king;” and she
gave a signal for fresh entertainments, exhausting the re-
sources of her art, the mines of her wealth, to fascinate him.
Ravishments of design and taste were on every side, and he
was in the lap of abundance, beguiled by magic, caressed by
beauty and a Queen. Marvel not that he was dazzled, and
imagined himself already come to the great things foretold of
him by the readers of planets and the casters of nativities in
Shiraz. He assisted in beguiling himself, trusting wilfully
to the two witnesses of things visible; as is declared by him
of wise sayings :
There is in every wizard.net a hole,
So the entangler first must blind the soul.

And it is again said by that same teacher:
Ye that the inner spirit's sight would seal,
Nought credit but what outward orbs reveal.
And the soul of Shibli Bagarag was blinded by Rabesqurat
in the depths of the Enchanted Sea. She sang to him, luting
deliriously; and he was intoxicated with the blissfulness of
his fortune, and took a lute and sang to her love-verses in
praise of her, rhyming his rapture. Then, they handed the
goblet to each other, and drank till they were on fire with
the joy of things, and life blushed beauteousness. Surely,
Rabesqurat was becoming forgetful of her arts through the
strength of those draughts, till her eye marked the Lily by
his side, which he grasped constantly, the bright flower,
and she started and said, “One grant, O my King, my
husband ! ”
So, he said courteously, “ All grants are granted to the
lovely, the fascinating; and their grief will be lack of aught
to ask for?”
· Then said she, “O my husband, my King, I am jealous
of that silly flower : laugh at my weakness, but fling it from
thee.”
Now, he was about to cast it from him, when a vanity
possessed his mind, and he exclaimed, “See first the thing I
will do, a wonder.”
She cried, “No wonders, my life! I am sated with
them.”
And he said, “I am oblivious, 0 Queen, of how I came
by this flower and this phial ; but thou shalt hear a thing
beyond the power of common magic, and see that I am
something."
Now, she plucked at him to abstain from his action, but
he held the phial to the flower. She signed imperiously to
some slaves to stay his right wrist, and they seized on it; but
not all of them together could withhold him from dropping
a drop into the petals of the flower, and lo, the Lily spake, a

175
voice from it like the voice of Noorna, saying, “Remember
the Seventh Pillar.” Thereat, he lifted his eyes to his brows
and frowned back memory to his aid, and the scene of Karaz,
Rabesqurat, Abarak, and his betrothed was present to him.
So perceiving that, the Queen delayed not while he grasped
the phial to take in her hands some water from a basin near,
and flung it over him, crying, “Oblivion !” And while his
mind was straining to bring back images of what had hap-
pened, he fell forward once more at the feet of Rabesqurat,
senseless as a stone falls; such was the force of her enchant-
ments.
Now, when he awoke the second time he was in the bosom
of darkness, and the Lily gone from his hand ; so, he lifted
the phial to make certain of that, and groped about till he
came to what seemed an urn to the touch, and into this he
dropped a drop, and asked for the Lily; and a voice said, “I
caught a light from it in passing." And he came in the
darkness to a tree, and a bejewelled bank, and other urns,
and swinging lamps without light, and a running water, and a
grassy bank, and flowers, and a silver seat, sprinkling each ;
and they said all in answer to his question of the Lily, “I
caught a light from it in passing." At the last he stumbled
upon the steps of a palace, and ascended them, endowing the
steps with speech as he went, and they said, “The light of it
went over us." He groped at the porch of the palace, and
gave the door a voice, and it opened on jasper hinges,
shrieking, “The light of it went through me.” Then he
entered a spacious hall, scattering drops, and voices exclaimed,
66 We glow with the light of it.” He passed, groping his
way through other halls and dusk chambers, scattering drops,
and as he advanced the voices increased in the fervour of
their replies, saying, “We blush with the light of it ;” “We
beam with the light of it;” “ We burn with the light of it.”
So, presently he found himself in a long low room, sombrely
lit, roofed with crystals; and in a corner of the room, lo ! a
damsel on a couch of purple, she white as silver, spreading

radiance. Of such lustrous beauty was she that beside her,
in sleep the Princess Goorelka as Shibli Bagarag first beheld
her, would have paled like a morning moon; even Noorna
had waned as doth a flower in fierce heat; and the Queen of
Enchantments was but the sun behind a sand-storm, in com-
parison with that effulgent damsel on the length of the purple
couch. Well for him he wist of the magic which floated
through that palace; as is said,
Tempted by extremes,
The soul is most secure;
Too vivid loveliness blinds with its beams,
And eyes turned inward soon perceive the lure.
Pulling down his turban hastily, he stepped on tiptoe to
within arm's reach of her, and, looking another way,
inclined over her soft vermeil mouth the phial slowly till it
brimmed the neck, and dropped a drop of Paravid between
the bow of those sweet lips. Still not daring to gaze on her,
he said then, “My question is of the Lily, the Lily of the
Sea, and where is it, О marvel ?”.
And he heard a voice answer in the tones of a silver bell,
clear as a wind in strung wires, “Where I lie, lies the Lily,
the Lily of the Sea ; I with it, it with me.”
Said he, “O breather of music, tell me how I may lay
hand on the flower of beauty to bear it forth.”
And he heard the voice, “An equal space betwixt my
right side and my left, and from the shoulder one span and
half a span downward.”
Still without power to eye her, he measured the space and
the spans, his hand beneath the coverlids of the couch, and
at a spot of the bosom his hand sank in, and he felt a
fluttering thing, fluttering like a frighted bird in the midst
of the fire. And the voice said, “Quick, seize it, and draw
it out, and tie it to my feet by the twines of red silk about it.”
He seized it and drew it out, and it was a heart-a heart
of blood-streaming with crimson, palpitating. Tears

flashed on his sight beholding it, and pity took the seat of
fear, and he turned his eyes full on her, crying, "O sad fair
thing ! O creature of anguish! O painful beauty! Oh, what
have I done to thee ?”
But she panted, and gasped short and shorter gasps, point-
ing with one finger to her feet. Then, he took the warm,
living heart while it yet leapt and quivered and sobbed; and
he held it with a trembling hand, and tied it by the red twines
of silk about it to her feet, staining their whiteness. When
that was done, his whole soul melted with pity and swelled
with sorrow, and ere he could meet her eyes a swoon overcame
him. Surely, when the world dawned to him a third time in
those regions the damsel was no longer there, but in her place
the Lily of Light. He thought, “It was a vision, that
damsel ! a terrible one; one to terrify and bewilder ! a bitter
sweetness ! Oh, the heart, the heart !” Reflecting on the
heart brought to his lids an overcharging of tears, and he
wept violently awhile. Then was he warned by the thought
of his betrothed to take the Lily and speed with it from the
realms of Rabesqurat; and he stole along the halls of the
palace, and by the plashing fountains, and across the magic
courts, passing chambers of sleepers, fair dreamers, and
through ante-rooms crowded with thick-lipped slaves. Lo,
as he held the Lily to light him on, and the light of the
Lily fell on them that were asleep, they paled and shrank,
and were such as the death-chill maketh of us. So, he called
upon his head the protection of Allah, and went swifter, to
chase from his limbs the shudder of awe; and there were some
that slept not, but stared at him with fixed eyes, eyes frozen
by the light of the Lily, and he shunned those, for they were
like spectres, haunting spirits. Now, after he had coursed the
length of the palace, he came to a steep place outside it, a
rock with steps cut in stairs, and up these he went till he came
to a small door in the rock, and lying by it a bar; so he
seized the bar and smote the door, and the door shivered, for
on his right wrist were the hairs of Garraveen. Bending his

body, he slipped through the opening, and behold, an orchard
dropping blossoms and ripe golden fruits, streams flowing
through it over sands, and brooks bounding above glittering
gems, and long dewy grasses, profusion of scented flowers,
shade and sweetness. So, he let himself down to the ground,
which was an easy leap from the aperture, and walked through
the garden, holding the Lily behind him, for here it darkened
all, and the glowing orchard was a desert by its light. . Pre-
sently, his eye fell on a couch swinging between two almond
trees, and advancing to it he bekeld the black-eyed Queen
gathered up, folded temptingly, like a swaying fruit; she
with the gold circlet on her head, and she was fair as blossom
of the almond in a breeze of the wafted rose-leagę Sweetly
was she gathered up, folded temptingly, and' sħibli Bagarag
refrained from using the Lily, thinking, “'T is like the great
things foretold of me, this having of Queens within the very
grasp, swinging to and fro as if to taunt backwardness !”
Then, he thought, “'T is an enchantress! I will yet try her.”
So, he made a motion of flourishing the Lily once or twice,
but forbore, fascinated, for she had on her fair face the soft-
ness of sleep, her lips closed in dimples, and the wicked fire
shut from beneath her lids. Mastering his mind, the youth
at last held the Lily to her, and saw a sight to blacken the
world and all bright things with its hideousness. Scarce had
he time to thrust the Lily in his robes, when the Queen
started up and clapped her hands, crying hurriedly, “ Abarak !
Abarak !” and the little man appeared in a moment at the
door by which Shibli Bagarag had entered the orchard. So,
she cried still, "Abarak !” and he moved toward her. Then
she said, “How came this youth here, prying in my private
walks, my bowers ? Speak !"
He answered, “By the aid of Garraveen only, O Queen !
and there is no force resisteth the bar so wielded.”
Rabesqurat looked under her brows at Shibli Bagarag and
saw the horror on his face, and she cried out to Abarak in an
agony, “Fetch me the mirror !” Then, Abarak ran, and

returned ere the Queen had drawn seven impatient breaths,
and in one hand he bore a sack, in the other a tray : so, he
emptied the contents of the sack on the surface of the tray;
surely they were human eyes! and the Queen flung aside her
tresses, and stood over them. The youth saw her smile at
them, and assume tender and taunting manners before them,
and imperious manners, killing glances, till in each of the
eyes there was a sparkle. Then she flung back her head as
one that feedeth on a mighty triumph, exclaiming, “ Yet am
I Rabesqurat! wide is my sovereignty.” Sideways then she
regarded Shibli Bagarag, and it seemed she was urging Abarak
to do a deed beyond his powers, he frowning and pointing to
the right wrist of the youth. So, she clenched her hands an
instant with that feeling which knocketh a nail in the coffin
of a desire not dead, and controlled herself, and went to the
youth, breaking into beams of beauty; and an enchanting
sumptuousness breathed round her, so that in spite of hini-
self he suffered her to take him by the hand and lead him
from that orchard through the shivered door and into the
palace and the hall of the jasper pillars. Strange thrills
went up his arm from the touch of that Queen, and they
were as little snakes twisting and darting up, biting poison-
bites of irritating blissfulness.
Now, the hall was spread for a feast, and it was hung with
lamps of silver, strewn with great golden goblets, and viands,
coloured meats, and ordered fruits on shining platters. Then
said she to Shibli Bagarag, “O youth! there shall be no
deceit, no guile between us. Thou art but my guest, I no
bride to thee, so take the place of the guest beside me."
So, he took his seat beside her, Abarak standing by, and
she helped the youth to this dish and that dish, from the
serving of slaves, caressing him with flattering looks to
starve aversion and nourish tender fellowship. And he was
like one that slideth down a hill and can arrest his descent
with a foot, yet faileth that freewill. When he had eaten
and drunk with her, the Queen said, “O youth, no other

than my guest! art thou not a prince in the country thou
comest from ?”
In a moment the pride of the barber forsook him, and he
equivocated, saying, “O Queen! there is among the stars
somewhere, as was divined by the readers of planets, a crown
hanging for me, and I search a point of earth to intercept
its fall."
She marked him beguiled by vanity, and put sweetmeats
to his mouth, exclaiming, “Thy manners be those of a
prince !” Then she sang to him of the loneliness of her life,
and of one with whom she wished to share her state,—such
as he. And at her signal came troops of damsels that stood
in rings and luted sweetly on the same theme—the Queen's
loneliness, her love. And he said to the Queen, “Is this so ?”
She answered, “Too truly so !”.
Now, he thought, “She shall at least speak the thing
that is, if she look it not.” So, he took the goblet, and con-
trived to drop a drop from the phial of Paravid therein with-
out her observing him; and he handed her the goblet, she
him; and they drank. Surely, the change that came over
the Queen was an enchantment, and her eyes shot lustre, her
tongue was loosed, and she laughed like one intoxicated, loll-
ing in her seat, lost to majesty and the sway of her magic,
crying, “O Abarak! Abarak ! little man, long my slave and
my tool ; ugly little man! And O Shibli Bagarag! nephew
of the barber! weak youth ! small prince of the tackle ! have
I not nigh fascinated thee? And thou wilt forfeit those two
silly eyes of thine to the sack. And, O Abarak, Abarak !
little man, have I flattered thee? So fetter I the strong with
my allurements ! and I stay the arrow in its flight! and I
blunt the barb of high intents! Wah! I have drunk a potent
stuff; I talk! Wullahy! I know there is a danger menacing
Shagpat, and the eyes of all Genii are fixed on him. And if
he be shaved, what changes will follow ! But 't is in me to
delude the barber, wullahy! and I will avert the calamity. I
will save Shagpat!”.

Now, while the Queen Rabesqurat prated in this wise with
flushed face, Shibli Bagarag was smitten with the greatness of
his task, and reproached his soul with neglect of it. And he
thought, “I am powerful by spells as none before me have
been, and 't was by my weakness the Queen sought to tangle
me. I will clasp the Seventh Pillar and make an end of it,
by Allah and his Prophet (praised be the name !), and I will
reach Aklis by a short path and shave Shagpat with the
sword.”
So, he looked up, and Abarak was before him, the lifted
nostrils of the little man wide with the flame of anger. And
Abarak said, “O youth, regard me with the eyes of judgement!
Now, is it not frightful to rate me little ?- an instigation of
the evil one to repute me ugly ?"
The promptings of wisdom counselled Shibli Bagarag to
say, “Frightful beyond contemplation, 0 Abarak ! one to
shame our species! Surely, there is a moon between thy legs,
a pear upon thy shoulders, and the cock that croweth is no
match for thee in measure."
So Abarak cried, “We be aggrieved, we two! () youth, son
of my uncle, I will give thee means of vengeance; give thou
me means."
Shibli Bagarag felt scorn at the Queen, and her hollowness,
and he said, “'T is well; take this lily and hold it to her.”
Now, the Queen jeered Abarak, and as he approached her
she shouted, “ What! thou small of build! mite of creation !
sour mixture ! thou puppet of mine ! thou ! comest thou to
seek a second kiss against the compact, knowing that I give
not the well-favoured of mortals beyond one, a second ?”.
Little delayed Abarak at this to put her to the test of the
Lily, and he held the flower to her, and saw the sight, and
staggered back like one stricken with a shaft. When he could
get a breath he uttered such a howl that Rabesqurat in her
drunkenness was fain to save her ears, and the hall echoed
as with the bellows of a thousand beasts of the forest. Then,
to glut his revenge he ran for the sack, and emptied the

contents of it, the Queen's mirror, before her; and the sack-
full of eyes, they saw the sight, and sickened, rolling their
whites. So, that done, Abarak gave Shibli Bagarag the bar
of iron, and bade him smite the pillars, all save the seventh ;
and he smote them strengthily, crumbling them at a blow,
and bringing down the great hall and its groves, and glasses
and gems, lamps, traceries, devices, a heap of ruin, the seventh
pillar alone standing. Then, while he pumped back breath
into his body, Abarak said, “There is no delaying in this
place now, O youth ! say, hast thou spells for the entering of
Aklis ?”
He answered, “Three !”
Then said Abarak, “'Tis well! Surely now, if thou
takest me in thy service, I 'll help thee to master the Event,
and serve thee faithfully, requiring nought from thee save a
sight of the Event, and 't is I that myself missed one, wiled
by Rabesqurat.”
Quoth Shibli Bagarag, “Thou?"
He answered, “No word of it now. Is 't agreed ?”
So Shibli Bagarag cried, “Even so."
Thereupon, the twain entered the pillar, leaving Rabesqurat
prone, and the waves of the sea bounding toward her where
she lay. Now, they descended and ascended flights of
slippery steps, and sped together along murky passages, in
which light never was, and under arches of caves with
hanging crystals, groping and tumbling on hurriedly, till
they came to an obstruction, and felt an iron door, frosty to
the touch. Then, Abarak said to Shibli Bagarag, “ Smite !"
And the youth lifted the bar to his right shoulder, and
smote; and the door obeyed the blow, and discovered an
opening into a strange dusky land, as it seemed a valley, on
one side of which was a ragged copper sun setting low, large
as a warrior's battered shield, giving deep red lights to a brook
that fell, and over a flat stream a red reflection, and to the
sides of the hills a dark red glow. The sky was a brown
colour; the earth a deeper brown, like the skins of tawny
lions. Trees with reddened stems stood about the valley,
are flat streamclour. The skskins of tay

scattered and in groups, showing between their leaves the
cheeks of melancholy fruits swarthily tinged, and toward
the centre of the valley a shining palace was visible,
supported by massive columns of marble reddened by that
copper sun. Shibli Bagarag was awed at the stillness that
hung everywhere, and said to Abarak, “Where am I, O
Abarak ? the look of this place is fearful !”
And the little man answered, “Where, but beneath the
mountains in Aklis ? Wullahy! I should know it, I that
keep the passage of the seventh pillar !”
Then, the thought of his betrothed Noorna, and her
beauty, and the words, “Remember the seventh pillar,"
struck the heart of Shibli Bagarag, and he exclaimed,
passionately, “Is she in safety ? Noorna, my companion,
my betrothed, netted by thee, 0 Abarak !”
Abarak answered sharply, “Speak not of betrothals in
this place, or the sword of Aklis will move without a hand !"
But Shibli Bagarag waxed the colour of the sun that was
over them, and cried, “By Allah ! I will smite thee with
the bar, if thou swear not to her safety, and point not out
to me where she now is.”
Then said Abarak, " Thou wilt make a better use of the
bar by lifting it to my shoulder, and poising it, and peering
through it.”
So, Shibli Bagarag lifted the bar to the shoulder of Abarak,
and poised it, and peered through the length of it, and lo!
there was a sea tossing in tumult, and one pillar standing
erect in the midst of the sea; and on the pillar, above the
washing waves, with hair blown back and flapping raiment,
pale but smiling still, Noorna, his betrothed ! Now, when he
saw her, he made a rush to the door of the passage ; but
Abarak blocked the way, crying, "Fool! a step backward in
Aklis is death!”
And when he had wrestled with him and reined him,
Abarak said, “Haste to reach the Sword from the sons of
Aklis, if thou wouldst save her.”
So, he drew him to the brink of the stream, and whistled

a parrot's whistle; and Shibli Bagarag beheld a boat draped
with drooping white lotuses that floated slowly toward them ;
and when it was near, he and Abarak entered it, and saw one,
a veiled figure, sitting in the stern, who neither moved to
them nor spake, but steered the boat to a certain point
of land across the stream, where stood an elephant ready
girt for travellers to mount him; and the elephant kneeled
among the reeds as they approached, that they might
mount him, and when they had each taken a seat, moved
off, waving his trunk. Presently the elephant came to
a halt, and went upon his knees again, and the two slid
off his back, and were among black slaves that bowed to the
ground before theni, and led them to the shining gates of the
palace in silence. Now, on the first marble step of the
palace there sat an old white-headed man dressed like
a dervish, who held out at arm's length a branch of gold
with golden singing-birds between its leaves, saying, “This
for the strongest of ye !”.
So, Abarak exclaimed, “I am that one;" and he held
forth his hand for the branch.
But Shibli Bagarag cried, “Nay, 't is mine. Wullahy,
what has not the strength of this hand overthrown ?"
Then the brows of Abarak twisted ; his limbs twitched,
and he bawled, “ To the proof !” waking all the echoes
of Aklis. Shibli Bagarag was tempted in his desire for
the golden branch to lift the iron bar upon Abarak,
when lo! the phial of Paravid fell from his vest, and he
took it and sprinkled a portion of the waters over the
singing-birds, and in a moment they burst into a sweet
union of voices, singing, in the words of the poet :
When for one serpent were two asses match ?
How shall one foe but with wiles master double ?
So let the strong keep for ever good watch,
Lest their strength prove a snare, and themselves a mere bubble;
For vanity maketh the strongest most weak,
As lions and men totter after the struggle.
Ye heroes, be modest! while combats ye seek,
The cunning one trippeth ye both with a juggle.

Now, at this verse of the birds Shibli Bagarag fixed
his eye on the old man, and the beard of the old man
shrivelled; he waxed in size, and flew up in a blaze and
with a baffled shout bearing the branch ; surely, his features
were those of Karaz, and Shibli Bagarag knew him by
the length of his limbs, his stiff ears, and copper skin.
Then he laughed a loud laugh, but Abarak sobbed, saying,
"By this know I that I never should have seized the
Sword, even though I had vanquished the illusions of
Rabesqurat, which held me fast half-way.”
So, Shibli Bagarag stared at him, and said, “Wert thou
also a searcher, 0 A barak ? "
But Abarak cried, “Rouse not the talkative tongue of the
past, O youth! Wullahy! relinquish the bar that is my
bar, won by me, for the sword is within thy gripe, and they
await thee up yonder steps. Go! go ! and look for me here
on thy return.”


## p. 186 (#200) ############################################

THE PALACE OF AKLIS.
Now, Shibli Bagarag assured himself of his three spells, and
made his heart resolute, and hastened up the reddened
marble steps of the Palace; and when he was on the topmost
step, lo! one with a man's body and the head of a buffalo,
that prostrated himself, and prayed the youth obsequiously
to enter the palace with the title of King. So, Shibli
Bagarag held his head erect, and followed him with the
footing of a Sultan, and passed into a great hall, with foun-
tains in it that were fountains of gems, pearls, chrysolites,
thousand-hued jewels, and by the margin of the fountains were
shapes of men with the heads of beasts-wolves, foxes, lions,
bears, oxen, sheep, serpents, asses,—that stretched their
hands to the falls, and loaded their vestments with brilliants,
loading them without cessation, so that from the vestments
of each there was another pouring of the strong liquid lights.
Then he with the buffalo's head bade Shibli Bagarag help
himself from the falls; but Shibli Bagarag refused, for his
soul was with Noorna, his betrothed ; and he saw her pale
on that solitary pillar in the tumult of the sea, and knew her
safety depended on his faithfulness.
He cried, “The Sword of Aklis ! nought save the Sword !"
Now, at these words the fox-heads and the sheep-heads
and the ass-heads and the other heads of beasts were lifted
up, and lo ! they put their hands to their ears, and tapped
their foreheads with the finger of reflection, as creatures

187
seeking to bring to mind a serious matter. Then the
fountains rose higher, and flung jets of radiant jewels, and a
drenching spray of gems upon them, and new thirst aroused
them to renew their gulping of the falls, and a look of
eagerness was even in the eyes of the ass-heads and the silly
sheep-heads; surely, Shibli Bagarag laughed to see them !
Now, when he had pressed his lips to recover his sight from
the dazzling of those wondrous fountains, he heard himself
again addressed by the title of King, and there was before
him a lofty cock with a man's head. So, he resumed the
majesty of his march, and followed the fine-stepping cock
into another hall, spacious, and clouded with heavy scents
and perfumes burning in censers and urns, musk, myrrh,
ambergris, and livelier odours, gladdening the nostril like
wine, making the soul reel as with a draught of the for-
bidden drink. Here, before a feast that would prick the
dead with appetite, were shapes of beasts with heads of men,
asses, elephants, bulls, horses, swine, foxes, river-horses,
dromedaries; and they ate and drank as do the famished
with munch and gurgle, clacking their lips joyfully. Shibli
Bagarag remembered the condition of his frame when first
he looked upon the City of Shagpat, and was incited to
eat and accede to the invitation of the cock with the man's
head, and sit among these merry feeders and pickers of
mouth-watering morsels, when, with the City of Shagpat, lo !
he had a vision of Shagpat, hairier than at their interview
arrogant in hairiness; his head remote in contemptuous
waves and curls and frizzes, and bushy protuberances of hair,
lost in it, like an idolatrous temple in impenetrable thickets.
Then the yearning of the Barber seized Shibli Bagarag, and
desire to shear Shagpat was as a mighty overwhelming wave
in his bosom, and he shouted, “The Sword of Aklis ! nought
-save the sword !"
Now, at these words the beasts with men's heads wagged
their tails, all of them, from right to left, and kept their
jaws from motion, staring stupidly at the dishes but

188
THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
the dishes began to send forth stealthy steams, insidious
whispers to the nose, silver intimations of savouriness, so
that they on a sudden set up a howl, and Shibli Bagarag
puckered his garments from them as from devouring dogs,
and hastened from that hall to a third, where at the entrance
stood a damsel that smiled to him, and led him into a vast
marbled chamber, forty cubits high, hung with draperies, and
in it a hundred doors; and he was in the midst of a very
rose-garden of young beauties, such as the Blest behold in
Paradise, robed in the colours of the rising and setting sun;
plump, with long, black, languishing, almond-shaped eyes,
and undulating figures. So, they cried to him, “What
greeting, O our King ?"
Now, he counted twenty and seven of them, and, fitting
his gallantry to verse, answered :
Poor are the heavens that have not ye
To swell their glowing plenty;
Up there but one bright moon I see,
Here mark I seren-and-twenty.
The damsels laughed and flung back their locks at his
flattery, sporting with him; and he thought, “These be sweet
maidens! I will know if they be illusions like Rabesqurat;"
so, as they were romping, he slung his right arm round one,
and held the Lily to her, but there was no change in her save
that she winked somewhat and her eyes watered ; and it was
so with the others, for when they saw him hold the Lily to
one they made him do so to them likewise. Then he took
the phial, and touched their lips with the waters, and lo!
they commenced luting and laughing, and singing verses, and
prattling, laughing betweenwhiles at each other; and one, a
noisy one, with long, black, unquiet tresses, and a curved
foot and roguish ankle, sang as she twirled :
My heart is another's, I cannot be tender;
Yet if thou storm it, I fain must surrender.
And another, a fresh-cheeked, fair-haired, full-eyed damsel,

189
strong upon her instep and stately in the bearing of her
shoulders, sang shrilly :
I'm of the mountains, and he that comes to me
Like eagle must win, and like hurricane woo me.
And another, reclining on a couch buried in dusky silks, like
a butterfly under the leaves, a soft ball of beauty, sang moan-
ingly :
Here like a fruit on the branch am I swaying ;
Spatch ere I fall, love! there's death in delaying.
And another, light as an antelope on the hills, with antelope
eyes edged with kohl, and timid, graceful movements, and
small, white, rounded ears, sang clearly :
Swiftness is mine, and I fly from the sordid ;
Follow me, follow! and you 'll be rewarded.
And another, with large limbs and massive mould, that
stepped like a cow leisurely cropping the pasture, and shook
with jewels amid her black hair and above her brown eyes,
and round her white neck and her wrists, and on her waist,
even to her ankle, sang as with a kiss upon every word :
Sweet 't is in stillness and bliss to be basking !
He who would have me, may have for the asking.
And another, with eyebrows like a bow, and arrows of fire in
her eyes, and two rosebuds her full moist parted pouting lips,
sang, clasping her hands, and voiced like the tremulous pas-
sionate bulbul in the shadows of the moon :
Love is my life, and with love I live only;
Give me life, lover, and leave me not lonely.
And a seventh, a very beam of beauty, and the perfection of
all that is imagined in fairness and ample grace of expression
and proportion, lo ! she came straight to Shibli Bagarag, and
took him by the hand and pierced him with lightning glances,
singing :
Were we not destined to meet by one planet ?
Can a fate cover us ?-can it, ah! can it ?

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And she sang tender songs to him, mazing him with blandish-
ments, so that the aim of existence and the summit of ambi-
tion now seemed to him the life of a king in that palace
among the damsels ; and he thought, “Wah! these be no
illusions, and they speak the thing that is in them. Wullahy,
loveliness is their portion ; they call me King."
Then she that had sung to him said, “Surely we have
been waiting thee long to crown thee our King! Thou hast
been in some way delayed, O glorious one!”
And he answered, “O fair ones, transcending in affability,
I have stumbled upon obstructions in my journey hither, and
I have met with adventures, but of this crowning that was to
follow them I knew nought. Wullahy, thrice have I been
saluted King; I whom fate selecteth for the Shaving of
Shagpat, and till now it was a beguilement, all emptiness."
Now, they marked his bewildered state, and some knelt
before him, some held their arms out adoringly, some leaned
to him with glistening looks, and he was fast falling a slave
to their flatteries, succumbing to them ; imagination fired him
with the splendours due to one that was a king, and the
thought of wearing a crown again took possession of his soul,
and he cried, “ Crown me, O my handmaidens, and delay not
to crown me; for, as the poet says:
"The king without his crown
Hath a forehead like the clown ;'
and the circle of my head itcheth for the symbols of majesty."
So, at these words of Shibli Bagarag they arose quickly and
clapped their hands, and danced with the nimble step of
gladness, exclaiming, “O our King! pleasant will be the time
with him !” And one smoothed his head and poured oil
upon it; one brought him garments of gold and silk inwoven;
one fetched him slippers like the sun's beam in brightness ;
others stood together in clusters, and with lutes and wood-
instruments, low-toned, singing odes to him ; and lo! one took
a needle and threaded it, and gave the thread into the hands

191
of Shibli Bagarag, and with the point of the needle she pricked
certain letters on his right wrist, and afterwards pricked the
same letters on a door in the wall. Then she said to him,
“Is it in thy power to make those letters speak ?”
He answered, “We will prove how that may be."
So, he flung some drops from the phial over the letters, and
they glowed the colour of blood and flashed with a report, and
it was as if a fiery forked-tongue had darted before them and
spake the words written, and they were, “This is the Crown
of him who hath achieved his aim and resteth here.” There-
upon, she stuck the needle in the door, and he pulled the
thread, and the door drew apart, and lo! a small chamber, and
on a raised cushion of blue satin a glittering crown, thick with
jewels as a frost, such as Ambition pineth to wear, and the
knees of men weaken and bend beholding, and it lanced lights
about it like a living sun. Beside the cushion was a vacant
throne, radiant as morning in the East, ablaze with devices in
gold and gems, a seat to fill the meanest soul with sensations
of majesty and tempt dervishes to the sitting posture. Shibli
Bagarag was intoxicated at the sight, and he thought, “Wah !
but if I sit on this throne and am a king, with that crown I
can command men and things ! and I have but to say, Fetch
Noorna, my betrothed, from yonder pillar in the midst of the
uproarious sea !—Let the hairy Shagpat be shaved ! and be-
hold, slaves, thousands of them, do my bidding! Wullahy,
this is greatness !” Now, he made a rush to the throne, but
the damsels held him back, crying, “Not for thy life till we
have crowned thee, O our master and lord !”
Then they took the crown and crowned him with it; and
he sat upon the throne calmly, serenely, like a Sultan of the
great race accustomed to sovereignty, tempering the awfulness
of his brows with benignant glances. So, while he sat the
damsels hid their faces and started some paces from him, as
unable to bear the splendour of his presence, and in a moment,
lo! the door closed between him and them, and he was in
darkness. Then he heard a voice of the damsels cry in the

hall, “The ninety and ninth! Peace now for us and blissful-
ness with our lords, for now all are filled save the door of the
Sword, which maketh the hundredth.” After that he heard
the same voice say, “Leave them, O my sisters !”
So, he listened to the noise of their departing, and knew he
had been duped. Surely his soul cursed him as he sat crowned
and throned in that darkness! He seized the crown to dash
it to the earth, but the crown fixed on his forehead and would
not come off; neither had he force to rise from the throne.
Now, the thought of Noorna, his betrothed, where she rested
waiting for him to deliver her, filled Shibli Bagarag with the
extremes of anguish ; and he lifted his right arm and dashed
it above his head in the violence of his grief, striking in the
motion a hidden gong that gave forth a burst of thunder and
a roll of bellowings, and lo ! the door opened before him, and
the throne as he sat on it moved out of the chamber into the
hall where he had seen the damsels that duped him, and on
every side of the hall doors opened ; and he marvelled to see
men, old and young, beardless and venerable, sitting upon
thrones and crowned with crowns, motionless, with eyes like
stones in the recesses. He thought, “ These be other dupes !
Wullahy! a drop of the waters of Paravid upon their lips
might reveal mysteries, and guide me to the sword of my
seeking.” So, as he considered how to get at them from the
seat of his throne, his gaze fell on a mirror, and he beheld the
crown on his forehead what it was, bejewelled asses' ears
stiffened upright, and skulls of monkeys grinning with gems !
The sight of that crowning his head convulsed Shibli Baga-
rag with laughter, and, as he laughed, his seat upon the throne
was loosened, and he pitched from it, but the crown stuck to
him and was tenacious of its hold as the lion that pounceth
upon a victim. So, he bowed to the burden of necessity, and
took the phial, and touched the lips of one that sat crowned
on a throne with the waters in the phial; and it was a man of
exceeding age, whitened with time, and in the long sweep of
his beard like a mountain clad with snow from the peak that

is in the sky to the base that slopeth to the valley. Then he
addressed the old man on his throne, saying, “Tell me, O
King ! how camest thou here ? and in search of what ?"
The old man's lips moved, and he muttered in deep tones,
“When cometh he of the ninety-and-ninth door ?"
So, Shibli Bagarag cried, “Surely he is before thee, in
Aklis."
And the old man said, “Let him ask no secrets; but when
he hath reached the Sword forget not to flash it in this hall,
for the sake of brotherhood in adventure.”
After that he was silent, and answered no word to any
questioning

THE SONS OF AKLIS.
Now, Shibli Bagarag thought, "The poet is right in Aklis
as elsewhere, in his words :
The cunning of our oft-neglected wit
Doth best the keyhole of occasion fit;'
and whoso looketh for help from others looketh the wrong
way in an undertaking. Wah! I will be bold and batter at
the hundredth door, which is the door of the Sword.” So,
he advanced straightway to the door, which was one of
solid silver, charactered with silver letters, and knocked
against it three knocks; and a voice within said, “ What
spells ? "
He answered, “Paravid; Garraveen ; and the Lily of the
Sea !”
Upon that the voice said, “ Enter by virtue of the spells !”
and the silver door swung open, discovering a deep pit, light-
ened by a torch, and across it, bridging it, a string of enor-
mous eggs, rocs' eggs, hollowed, and so large that a man
might walk through them without stooping. At the side of
each egg three lamps were suspended from a claw, and the
shell passage was illumined with them from end to end.
Shibli Bagarag thought, “These eggs are of a surety the eggs
of the Roc mastered by Aklis with his sword !” Now, as
the sight of Shibli Bagarag grew familiar to the place, he
beheld at the bottom of the pit a fluttering mass of blackness

195
and two sickly eyes that glittered below. Then thought he,
“ Wah! if that be the Roc, and it not dead, will the bird
suffer one to defile its eggs with other than the sole of the
foot, naked ?” So, he undid his sandals and kicked off the
slippers given him by the damsels that had duped him, and went
into the first egg over the abyss, and into the second, and
into the third, and into the fourth, and into the fifth. Surely
the eggs swung with him, and bent; and the fear of their
breaking and he falling into the maw of the terrible bird
made him walk unevenly. Now, when he had come to the
seventh egg, which was the last, it shook and swung violently,
and he heard underneath the flapping of the wings of the
Roc as with eagerness expecting a victim to prey upon. He
sustained his soul with the firmness of resolve and darted
himself lengthwise to the landing, clutching a hold with his
right hand; as he did so, the bridge of eggs broke, and he
heard the feathers of the bird in agitation, and the bird
screaming a scream of disappointment as he scrambled up the
sides of the pit. Now, Shibli Bagarag failed not to perform
two prostrations to Allah, and raised the song of gratitude
for his preservation when he found himself in safety. Then
he looked up, and lo! behind a curtain, steps leading to an
anteroom, and beyond that a chamber like the chamber of
kings where they sit in state dispensing judgements, like the
sun at noon in splendour ; and in the chamber seven youths,
tall and comely young men, calm as princes in their port, each
one dressed in flowing robes, and with a large glowing pearl
in the front of their turbans. So, they advanced to meet
him, saying, “Welcome to Aklis, thou that art proved
worthy! 'T is holiday now with us ;” and they took him
by the hand and led him with them in silence past fountain-
jets and porphyry pillars to where a service with refreshments
was spread,-meats, fowls with rice, sweetmeats, preserves,
palateable mixtures, and monuments of the cook's art, goblets
of wine like liquid rubies. Then one of the youths said to
Shibli Bagarag, “Thou hast come to us crowned, o our

guest! Now, it is not our custom to pay homage, but thou
shalt presently behold them that will, so let not thy kingli-
ness droop with us, but feast royally.”
And Shibli Bagarag said, “O my princes, surely it is a
silly matter to crown a mouse! Humility hath depressed
my stature ! Wullahy, I have had warning in the sticking of
this crown to my brows, and it sticketh like an abomination."
So, they laughed at him, saying, “ It was the heaviness
of that crown which overweighted thee in the bridge of
the abyss, and few be they that bear it and go not to feed
the Roc.”
Now, they feasted together, interchangeing civilities,
offering to each other choice morsels, dainties. And the
anecdotes of Shibli Bagarag, his simplicity and his honesty,
and his vanity and his airiness, and the betraying tongue of
the barber, diverted the youths; and they plied him with
old wine till his stores of merriment broke forth and were
as a river swollen by torrents of the mountain ; and the
seven youths laughed at him, spluttering with laughter,
lurching with it. Surely, he described to them the loquacity
of Baba Mustapha his uncle, and they laughed so that their
chins were uppermost; but at his mention of Shagpat
greater gravity was theirs, and they smoothed their faces
solemnly, and the sun of their merriment was darkened for:
awhile. Then they took to flinging about pellets of a
sugared preparation, and reciting verses in praise of jovial
living, challenging to drink this one and that one, passing
the cup with a stanza. Shibli Bagarag thought, “ What a
life is this led by these youths! a fair one! 'T is they
that be the sons of Aklis that sharpen the Sword of Events;
yet live they in jollity, skimming from the profusion of
abundance that which floateth !”
Now, marking him contemplative, one of the youths
shouted, “The King lacketh homage !"
And another called, “ Admittance for his people!”
Then the seven arose and placed Shibli Bagarag on an

elevation in the midst of them, and lo! a troop of black
slaves leading by the collar, asses, and by a string, monkeys.
Now, for the asses they brayed to the Evil One, and the
monkeys were prankish, pulling against the string, till they
caught sight of Shibli Bagarag. Then was it as if they
had been awe-stricken; and they came forward to him with
docile steps, eyeing the crown on his head, and prostrated
themselves, the asses and the monkeys, like creatures in
whom glowed the lamp of reason and the gift of intelligence.
So, Shibli Bagarag drooped his jaw and was ashamed, and he
cried, “O my princes ! am I a King of these?”
. They answered, “A King in mightiness ! Sultan of a
race !"
So, he said, “It is certain I shall need physic to support
such a sovereignty! And I must be excused liberal allow-
ances of old wine to sit in state among them. Wullahy!
they were best gone for awhile. Send them from me, O my
princes! I sicken.”
And he called to the animals, “Away! begone!” frowning.
Then said the youths, “Well commanded ! and like a
King! See, they troop from thy presence obediently.”
Now the animals fled from before the brows of Shibli
Bagarag, and when the chamber was empty of them the
seven young men said, “Of a surety thou wert flattered to
observe the aspect of these animals at beholding thee.”
But he cried, “Not so, O my princes; there is nought
flattering in the homage of asses and monkeys.” .
Then they said, “O Sultan of asses, ruler of monkeys,
better that than thyself an ass and an ape! As was said by
Shah Kasirwan, “I prefer being king of beasts worshipped
by beasts, rather than a crowned beast worshipped by
men ;' and it was well said. Wullahy! the kings of Roum
quote it.”
Now Shibli Bagarag was not rendered oblivious of the
Sword of his quest by the humour of these youths, or the
wine-bibbings, and he exclaimed while they were turning up

the heels of their cups, “O ye sons of Aklis, know that I
have come hither for the Sword sharpened by your hands,
for the releasing of my betrothed, Noorna bin Noorka,
daughter of the Vizier Feshnavat, and for the Shaving of
Shagpat."
So, while he was proceeding to recount the story of his
search for the Sword, they said, “Enough, 0 potentate of
the braying class and of the scratching tribe ! we have seen
thee through the eye of Aklis since the time of thy first
thwacking. What says the poet ?-
"A day for toil and a day for rest
Gives labour zeal, and pleasure zest.'
So, of thy seeking let us hear to-morrow; but now drink with
us, and make merry, and touch the springs of memory; spout
forth verses, quaint ones, suitable to the hour and the enter-
tainment. Wullahy ! drink with us! taste life! Let the
humours flow."
Then they made a motion to some slaves, and presently a
clattering of anklets struck the ear of Shibli Bagarag : look-
ing, he beheld dancing.girls, moons of beauty and elegance,
and they danced wild dances, and dances graceful and leopard-
like and serpent-like in movement; and the youths flung
flowers at them, applauding them. Then came other sets of
dancers even lovelier, more languishing; and again others
with tambourines and musical instruments, that sang ravish.
ingly. So, the senses of Shibli Bagarag were all taken with
what he saw and heard, and ate and drank; and by degrees
a mist came before his eyes, and the sweet sounds and voices
of the girls grew distant, and it was with difficulty he
kept his back from the length of the cushions that were about
him. Then he thought of Noorna, and that she sang to him
and danced, and when he rose to embrace her she was
Rabesqurat by the light of the Lily! And he thought of
Shagpat, and that in shaving him the blade was checked in
its rapid sweep, and blunted by a stumpy twine of hair that

waxed in size and became the head of Karaz that gulped at
him a wide devouring gulp, and took him in, and flew up
with him, leaving Shagpat half sheared. Then he thought
himself struggling halfway down the throat of the monstrous
Roc, and that, when he was wholly inside the Roc, he was
in a wide-arched passage crowded with lamps, and at the end
of the passage Noorna in the clutch of Karaz, she shouting,
“The Sword, the Sword !” Now while he felt for the Sword
wherewith to release her from the Genie, his eyes opened,
and he saw day through a casement, and that he had reposed
on an embroidered couch in the corner of a stately room
ornamented with carvings of blue and gold. So, while he
wondered and yawned, gaping, slaves started up from the
floor and led him to a bath of coloured marble, and bathed
him in perfumed waters, and dressed him in a dress of yellow
silk, rich and ample. Then they paraded before him through
lesser apartments and across terraces, till they came to a great
hall, loftier and more spacious than any he had yet beheld,
with fountains at the two ends, and in the centre a tree with
golden spreading branches and leaves of gold; among the
leaves gold-feathered birds, and fruits of all seasons and every
description— the drooping grape and the pleasant-smelling
quince, and the blood-red pomegranate, and the apricot, and
the green and rosy apple, and the gummy date, and the oily
pistachio-nut, and peaches, and citrons, and oranges, and the
plum, and the fig. Surely, they were countless in number,
melting with ripeness, soft, full to bursting; and the birds
darted among them like sun-flashes. Now, Shibli Bagarag
thought, “This is a wondrous tree! Wullahy! there is
nought like it save the tree in the hall of the Prophet in
Paradise, feeding the faithful !” As he regarded it he heard
his name spoken in the hall, and turning he beheld seven
youths in royal garments, that were like the youths he had
feasted with, and yet unlike them, pale, and stern in their
manners, their courtesy as the courtesy of kings. They said,
“Sit with us and eat the morning's meal, o our guest !"

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
So, he sat with them under the low branches of the tree;
and they whistled the tune of one bird and of another bird,
and of another, and lo! those different birds flew down with
golden baskets hanging from their bills, and in the baskets
fruits and viands and sweetmeats, and cool drinks. And
Shibli Bagarag ate from the baskets of the birds, watching
the action of the seven youths and the difference that was in
them. He sought to make them recognize him and acknow-
ledge their carouse of the evening that was past, but they
stared at him strangely and seemed offended at the allusion,
neither would they hear mention of the Sword of his seeking.
Presently, one of the youths stood upon his feet and cried,
“ The time for kings to sit in judgement !”
And the youths arose and led Shibli Bagarag to a hall of
ebony, and seated him on the upper seat, themselves standing
about him; and lo! asses and monkeys came before him,
complaining of the injustice of men and their fellows, in
brays and bellows and hoots. Now, at the sight of them
again Shibli Bagarag was enraged, and he said to the youths,
“How ! do ye not mock me, 0 masters of Aklis !”
But they said only, “The burden of his crown is for the
King."
He cooled, thinking, “I will use a spell.” So, he touched
the lips of an animal with the waters of Paravid, and the
animal prated volubly in our language of the kick this ass
had given him, and the jibe of that monkey, and of his desire
of litigation with such and such a beast for pasture; and the
others when they spake had the same complaints to make.
Shibli Bagarag listened to them gravely, and it was revealed
to him that he who ruleth over men hath a labour and duties
of hearing and judging and dispensing judgement similar to
those of him who ruleth over apes and asses. Then said he,
“O youths, my princes ! methinks the sitting in this seat
giveth a key to secret sources of wisdom; and I see what it
is, the glory and the exaltation coveted by men.” Now, he
took from the asses and the monkeys one, and said to it, "Be

my to q chief vizier,” and to another, “Be my chamberlain !"
and Shai to another, “Be my treasurer !” and so on, till a dispute
aror Sse between the animals, and jealousy of each other was
• visible in their glances, and they appealed to him clamorously.
So, he said, “What am I to ye?”
They answered, “Our King !"
And he said, “How so?”
They answered, “By the crowning of the brides of Aklis.”
Then he said, “What be ye, O my subjects?”.
They answered, “Men that were searchers of the Sword
and plunged into the tank of temptation."
And he said, “How that?"
They answered, “By the lures of vanity, the blinding of
ambition, and tasting the gall of the Roc."
So, Shibli Bagarag leaned to the seven youths, saying, “O
my princes, but for not tasting the gall of the Roc I might be
as one of these. Wullahy! I the King am warned by base
creatures.” Then he said to the animals, “Have ye still a
longing for the crown?”
And they cried, all of them, “O light of the astonished
earth, we care for nought other than it.”
· So, he said, “ And is it known to ye how to dispossess the
wearer of his burden ?”
They answered, “By a touch of the gall of the Roc on his
forehead.”
Then, he lifted his arms, crying, “Hie out of my presence!
and whoso of ye fetcheth a drop of the gall, with that one
will I exchange the crown.”
At these words some moved hastily, but the most faltered,
as doubting and incredulous that he would propose such an
exchange ; and one, an old monkey, sat down and crossed his
legs, and made a study of Shibli Bagarag, as of a sovereign
that held forth a deceiving bargain. But he cried again,
“Hie and haste ! as my head is now cased I think it not the
honoured part.”
Then, the old monkey arose with a puzzled look, half

scornful, and made for the door slowly, turning his bi
toward Shibli Bagarag betweenwhiles as he went, as
scratching his lower limbs with the mute reflectiveness
age and extreme caution.
Now, when they were gone, Shibli Bagarag looked in the
eyes of the seven youths, and saw they were content with him,
and his countenance was brightened with approval. So, he
descended from his seat, and went with them from the hall
of ebony to a court were horses were waiting saddled, and
slaves with hawks on their wrists stood in readiness; and
they mounted each a horse, but he loitered. The seven
youths divined his feeling, and cried impatiently, “Come!
no lingering in Aklis !". So, he mounted likewise, and they
emerged from the palace, and entered the hills that glowed
under the copper sun, and started a milk-white antelope with
ruby spots, and chased it from its cover over the sandhills, a
hawk being let loose to worry it and distress its timid
beaming eyes. When the creature was quite overcome, one
of the youths struck his heel into his horse's side and flung
a noose over the head of the quarry, and drew it with them,
gently petting it the way home to the palace. At the gates
of the palace it was released, and lo! it went up the steps,
and passed through the halls as one familiar with them.
Now, when they were all assembled in the anteroom of the
hall, where Shibli Bagarag had first seen the seven youths,
sons of Aklis, in their jollity, one of them said to the
Antelope, “We have need of thee to speak a word with
Aklis, O our sister !"
So, the same. youth requested the use of the phial of
Paravid, and Shibli Bagarag applied it carefully, tenderly, to
the mouth of the Antelope. Then, the Antelope spake in a
silver-ringing voice, saying, "What is it, O my brothers ? ”
They answered, “Thou knowest we dare not attempt
interchange of speech with Aklis, seeing that we disobeyed
him in visiting the kingdoms of the earth : so it is for thee

are So she said, “'T is well; I wot of it."
Then, she advanced to the curtain concealing the abyss of
the Roc and the bridge of its eggs, and went behind it.
There was a pause, and they heard her say presently in a
grave voice, toned with reverence, “How is it, О our father?
is it a good thing that thy Sword be in use at this
season ? "
And they heard the Voice answer from a depth, “ 'T were
well it rust not 1".
They heard her say, “O our father Aklis, and we wish
to know if the Shaving of Shagpat be held in favour by
thee, and thou sanction it with thy Sword.”
And they heard the Voice answer, “The Shaving of
Shagpat is my Sword alone equal to, and he that shaveth
him performeth a service to mankind ranking next my
vanquishing of the Roc.”
Then, they heard her say, “And it is thy will we teach
him the mysteries of the sword, and that which may be done
with it?”
And they heard the Voice answer, “Even so !”
After that the Voice was still, and soon the Antelope
returned from behind the curtain, and the youths caressed
her with brotherly caresses, and took a circle of hands about
her, and so moved to the great Hall of the gorgeous Tree,
and fed her from the branches. Now, while they were
there, Shibli Bagarag advanced to the Antelope, and knelt
at her feet, and said, “O Princess of Aklis, surely I am
betrothed to one constant as a fixed star, and brighter; a
mistress of magic, and innocent as the bleating lamb; and
she is now on a pillar, chained there, in the midst of the
white wrathful sea, wailing for me to deliver her with this
Sword of my seeking. So, now, I pray thee help me to the
Sword swiftly, that I may deliver her.”

The youths, her brothers, clamoured and interposed,
saying, “Take thy shape ere that, O Gulrevaz, our sister !”
But she cried, “He is betrothed ! not till he graspeth the
Sword. Tell him, the youth, our conditions, and for what
exchange the Sword is yielded.”
So, they said, “The conditions are, thou part with thy
spells, all of them, O youth !”.
And he said, “There is no condition harsh that exchangeth
the Sword ; 0 ye seven, I agree !"
Then she said, “'T is well ! nobility is in the soul of this
youth. Go before us now to the Cave of Chrysolites, O my
brothers.”
So, these departed before, and she in her antelope form
followed footing gracefully, and made Shibli Bagarag repeat
the story of his betrothal as they went.

THE SWORD OF AKLIS.
Now, when they had made the passage of many halls, built of
different woods, filled with divers wonders, they descended a
sloping vault, and came to a narrow way in the earth, hung
with black, at the end of it a steadfast blaze like a sun, that
grew larger as they advanced, and they heard the sea above
them. The noise of it, and its plunging and weltering and
its pitilessness, struck on the heart of Shibli Bagarag as with
a blow, and he cried, “Haste, haste, O Princess! perchance
she is even now calling to me with her tongue, and I not aid-
ing her, delayed by the temptation of this crown and the
guile of the Brides."
She checked him, and said, “In Aklis no haste !” Then,
she said, “Look!" And lo, fronting them the single blaze
became two fires; and drawing nigh, Shibli Bagarag beheld
them what they were, angry eyes in the head of a great lion,
a model of majesty, and passion was in his mane and power
was in his forepaws; so while he lashed his tail as a tempest
whippeth the tawny billows at night, and was lifting himself
for a roar, she said, “A hair of Garraveen, and touch him
with it !”
So, Shibli Bagarag pushed up his sleeve and broke one of
the three sapphire hairs and stepped forward to the lion,
holding in his right hand the hair of vivid light. The lion
crouched, and was in the vigour of the spring when that hair
touched him, and he trembled, tumbling on his knees and

letting the twain pass. So, they advanced beyond him, and
lo ! the Cave of Chrysolites irradiate with beams, breaks of
brilliance, confluences of lively hues, restless rays, meeting,
vanishing, flooding splendours, now scattered in dazzling
joints and spars, now uniting in momentary disks of radiance.
In the centre of the cave glowed a furnace, and round it
he distinguished the seven youths, swarthier and sterner than
before, dark sweat standing on the brows of each. Their
words were brief, and they wore each a terrible frown, saying
to him, without further salutation, “Thrust in the flame of
this furnace thy right wrist.”
At the same moment, the Antelope said in his ear, “Do
their bidding, and be not backward ! In Aklis fear is ruin
and hesitation a destroyer.”
So, he fixed his mind on the devotedness of Noorna, and
held his nether lip tightly between his teeth, and thrust his
right wrist in the flame of the furnace. The wrist reddened,
and became transparent with heat, but he felt no pain, only that
his whole arm was thrice its natural weight. Then, the flame
of the furnace fell, and the seven youths made him kneel by
a brook of golden waters and dip his forehead up to his eyes
in the waters. Then, they took him to the other side of the
cave, and his sight was strengthened to mark the glory of the
Sword, where it hung in slings, a little way from the wall,
outshining the lights of the cave, and throwing them back
with its superior force and steadfastness of lustre. Lo ! the
length of it was as the length of crimson across the sea when
the sun is sideways on the wave, and it seemed full a mile
long, the whole blade sheening like an arrested lightning
from the end to the hilt; the hilt two large live serpents
twined together, with eyes like sombre jewels and sparkling
spotted skins, points of fire in their folds, and reflections of
the emerald and topaz and ruby stones, studded in the blood-
stained haft. Then, the seven young men, sons of Aklis,
said to Shibli Bagarag, “Surrender the Lily!” And when
he had given into their hands the Lily, they said, “ Grasp
the handle of the Sword !"

THE SWORD OF AKLIS.
207
Now, he beheld the Sword and the ripples of violet heat
that were breathing down it, and those two venomous serpents
twined together, and the size of it, its ponderousness; and to
essay lifting it appeared to him a madness, but he concealed
his thought, and, setting his soul on the safety of Noorna,
went forward to it boldly, and piercing his right arm between
the twists of the serpents, grasped the jewelled haft. Surely,
the Sword moved from the slings as if a giant had swayed
it! But what amazed him was the marvel of the blade, for
its sharpness was such that nothing stood in its way, and it
slipped through everything as we pass through still water,
the stone columns, blocks of granite by the walls, the walls of
earth, and the thick solidity of the ground beneath his feet.
They bade him say to the Sword, “Sleep!” and it was no
longer than a knife in the girdle. Likewise, they bade him
hiss on the heads of the serpents, and say, “Wake !”
and while he held it lengthwise it shot lengthening out.
Then, they bade him hold in one hand the sapphire hair
that conquered the lion, and with the edge of the Sword
touch one point of it. So, he did that, and it split in half,
and the two halves he also split; and he split those four, and
those eight, till the hairs were thin as light and not dis-
tinguishable from it. When Shibli Bagarag saw the power
of the Sword, he exulted and cried, "Praise be to the science
of them that forecast events and the haps of life!” Now,
in the meantime he marked the youths take those hairs of
Garraveen that he had split, and tie them round the neck of
the Antelope, and empty the contents of the phial down her
throat; and they put the bulb of the Lily, that was a heart,
in her mouth, and she swallowed it till the flour covered her
face. Then, they took each a handful of the golden waters
of the brook flowing through the cave, and flung the waters
over her, exclaiming, “By the three spells that have power
in Aklis, and by which these waters are a blessing !”
In the passing of a flash she took her shape, and was a
damsel taller than the tallest of them that descend from the

mountains, a vision of loveliness, with queenly brows, closed
red lips, and large full black eyes; her hair black, and on it
a net of amber strung with pearls. To look upon her was to
feel the tyranny of love, love's pangs of alarm and hope and
anguish; and she was dressed in a dress of white silk, threaded
with gold and sapphire, showing in shadowy beams her rounded
figure and the stateliness that was hers. So, she ran to her
brothers and embraced them, calling them by their names,
catching their hands, caressing them as one that had been
long parted. Then, seeing Shibli Bagarag as he stood trans-
fixed with the javelins of loveliness that flew from her on all
sides, she cried : “What, O Master of the Event! hast thou
nought for the Sword but to gaze before thee in silliness ?”
Then, he said, “O rare in beauty! marvel of Aklis and the
world ! surely the paradise of the eye is thy figure and the
glory of thy face !"
But she shouted, “To work with the Sword! Shame on
thee! is there not one, a bright one, a miracle in faithfulness,
that awaiteth thy rescue on the pillar ?”
And she repeated the praises he had spoken of Noorna bin
Noorka, his betrothed. Then, he grasped the Sword firmly,
remembering the love of Noorna, and crying, “ Lead me from
this, O ye sons of Aklis, and thou, Princess Gulrevaz, lead,
me, that I may come to her.”
So, they said, “Follow us !” and he sheathed the Sword
in his girdle with the word “Sleep!” and followed them,
his heart beating violently,

By that light
Now, they sped from the Cave of Chrysolites by another
passage than that by which they entered it, and nothing but
the light of the Sword to guide them. By that light Shibli
Bagarag could distinguish glimmering shapes, silent and
statue-like, to the right and the left of them, their visages
hidden in a veil of heavy webs; and he saw what seemed in
the dusk broad halls, halls of council, and again black pools
and black groves, and columns of crowded porticoes,-all
signs of an underground kingdom. Then, they came to some
steps and mounted these severally, coming to a platform, in
the middle of which leapt a fountain, the top spray of it
touched with a beam of earth and the air breathed by men.
Here he heard the youths dabble with the dark waters,
and he discerned Gulrevaz tossing it in her two hands,
calling, “Koorookh ! Koorookh !” Then, they said to him,
6Stir this fountain with the Sword, O Master of the Event!''
So, he stirred the fountain, and the whole body of it took a
leap toward the light that was like the shoot of a long
lance of silver in the moon's rays, and lo! in its place the
ruffled feathers of a bird. Then, the seven youths and the
Princess and Shibli Bagarag got up under its feathers like a
brood of water-fowl; and the bird winged straight up as
doth a blinded bee, ascending, and passing in the ascent a
widening succession of winding terraces, till he observed the
copper sun of Aklis and the red lands below it. Thrice, in

the exuberance of his gladness, he waved the Sword,
and the sun lost that dulness on its disk and took a
bright flame, and threw golden arrows everywhere ; and
the pastures were green, the streams clear, the sands
sparkling. Then, the bird flew, and circled, and hung
poised a moment, presently descending on the roof of the
palace. Now, there was here a piece of solid glass, propped
on two crossed bars of gold, and it was shaped like an eye,
and might have been taken for one of the eyes inhabiting
the head of some monstrous Genie. Shibli Bagarag ran to it
when he was afoot, and peered through it. Surely, it was
the first object of his heart that he beheld-Noorna, his
betrothed, pale on the pillar; she with her head between her
hands and her hair scattered by the storm, as one despairing.
Still he looked, and he saw swimming round the pillar that
monstrous fish, with its sole baleful eye, which had gulped
them both in the closed shell of magic pearl ; and he knew
the fish for Karaz, the Genie, their enemy. Then, he turned
to the Princess with an imploring voice for counsel how to
reach her and bring her rescue; but she said, " The Sword
is in thy hands, none of us dare wield it ;” and the seven
youths answered likewise. So, left to himself, he drew the
Sword from his girdle, and hissed on the heads of the
serpents, at the same time holding it so that it might
lengthen out illimitably. Then, he leaned it over the eye of
the glass, in the direction of the pillar besieged by the
billows, and lo! with one cut, even at that distance, he
divided the fishy monster, and with another severed the
chains that had fettered Noorna ; and she arose and smiled
blissfully to the sky, and stood upright, and signalled him to
lay the point of the blade on the pillar. Now, when he had
done this, knowing her wisdom, she put a foot boldly upon the
blade and ran up it toward him, and she was half-way up the
blade, when suddenly a kite darted down upon her, pecking
at her eyes, to confuse her. Then, she waxed unsteady and
swayed this way and that, balancing with one arm and

defending herself from the attacks of the kite with another.
It seemed to Shibli Bagarag she must fall and be lost; and
the sweat started on his forehead in great drops as big as
nuts. Seeing that and the agitation of his limbs, Gulrevaz
cried, “O Master of the Event, let us hear it !”
But he shrieked, “The kite! the kite ! she is running up
the blade, and the kite is at her eyes! and she is swaying,
swaying ! falling, falling!”
So, the Princess exclaimed, “ A kite ! Koorookh is match
for a kite !”
Then she smoothed the throat of Koorookh, and clasped
round it a collar of bright steel, roughened with secret charac-
ters; and she took a hoop of gold, and passed the bird
through it, urging it all the while with one strange syllable ;
and the bird went up with a strong whirr of the wing till he
was over the sea, and caught sight of Noorna tottering be-
neath him on the blade, and the kite pecking fiercely at her.
Thereat, he fluttered eagerly a twinkle of time, and the next
was down with his beak in the neck of the kite, crimsoned in
it. Now, by the shouts and exclamations of Shibli Bagarag,
the Princess and the seven youths, her brothers, knew that
the bird had performed well his task, and that the fight was
between Koorookh and the kite. Then, he cried gladly to
them, “ Joy for us, and Allah be praised! The kite is
dropping, and she leaneth on one wing of Koorookh !”
And he cried in anguish, “What see I? The kite is
become a white ball, rolling down the blade toward her; and
it will of a surety destroy her.” And he called to her,
thinking vainly his voice might reach her. So, the Princess
said, “A white ball ? 't is I that am match for a white
ball !"
Now, she seized from the corner of the palace-roof a bow
and an arrow, and her brothers lifted her to a level with
the hilt of the Sword, leaning on the eye of glass. Then,
she planted one foot on the shoulder of Shibli Bagarag as
he bent peering through the eye, and fitted the arrow to a

level of the Sword, slanting its slant, and let it fly, doubling
the bow. Shibli Bagarag saw the ball roll to within a
foot of Noorna, when it was as if stricken by a gleam of
light, and burst, and was a black cloud veined with fire,
swathing her in folds. Then, he lost all sight of Noorna;
and where she had been were vivid flashes, and then a great
flame, and in the midst a red serpent and a green serpent
twisted as in the death-struggle. So he cried, “A red
serpent and a green serpent !”.
And the sons of Aklis exclaimed, “A red serpent? 'T is
we that are match for a red serpent !"
Thereupon, they descended steps through the palace-roof,
and while the fight between those two serpents was raging,
Shibli Bagarag beheld seven small bright birds, bee-catchers,
that entered the flame, bearing in their bills slips of a herb,
and hovering about the head of the red serpent, distracting
it. Then, he saw the red serpent hiss and snap at one,
darting out its tongue, and lo! on the fork of its tongue the
little bird let fall the slip of herb in its bill, and in an
instant the serpent changed from red to yellow and from
yellow to pale-spotted blue, and from that to a speckled
indigo-colour, writhing at every change, and hissing fire from
its open jaws. Meantime, the green serpent was released
and was making circles round the flame, seeking to complete
some enchantment, when suddenly the whole scene vanished,
and Shibli Bagarag again beheld Noorna steadying her steps
on the blade, and leaning on one wing of Koorookh. She
advanced up the blade, coming nearer and nearer; and he
thought her close, and breathed quick and ceased looking
through the glass. When he gazed abroad, lo! she was with
Koorookh, on a far hill beyond the stream in outer Aklis !
So, he said to the Princess Gulrevaz, “O Princess, comes she
not to me here in the palace ?"
But the Princess shook her head, and said, “She hath not
a spell! She waiteth for thee yonder with Koorookh. Now,
look through the glass once more."

So, he looked through the glass, and there on a plain, as he
had first seen it when Noorna appeared to him, was the City
of Shagpat, and in the streets of the city a vast assembly, and
a procession passing on, in its front banners surmounted by
the Crescent, and bands with curled and curved instruments
playing, and slaves scattering gold and clashing cymbals,
every demonstration and evidence of a great day and a high
occasion in the City of Shagpat! So, he peered yet keenlier
through the glass, and behold, the Vizier Feshnavat, father
of Noorna, walking in fetters, subject to the jibes and evil-
speaking of the crowds of people, his turban off, and he in a
robe of drab-coloured stuff, in the scorned condition of an
unbeliever, villanously low! So, Shibli Bagarag peered
yet more earnestly through the glass eye, and in the centre
of the procession, clad gorgeously in silks and stuffs, woven
with gold and gems, a crown upon his head, and the ap-
panages of supremacy and majesty about him, lo Shagpat!
He paced upon a yellow flooring that was unrolled before
him from a mighty roll; and there were slaves that
swarmed on all sides of him, supporting upon gold
pans and platters the masses of hair that spread bushily
before and behind, and to the right and left of him.
Truly, the gravity of his demeanour exceeded that which
is attained by Sheiks and Dervishes after much drinking of
the waters of wisdom, and fasting, and abnegation of the
pleasures that betray us to folly in this world ! Now, when
he saw Shagpat, the soul of Shibli Bagarag was quickened to
do his appointed work upon him, shear him, and release the
Vizier Feshnavat. Desire to shave Shagpat was as a salt
thirst raging in him, as the dream of munching to one that
starveth; even as the impelling of violent tempests to skiffs
on the sea; and he hungered to be at him, crying, as he
peered, "'T is he ! even he, Shagpat!”
Then, he turned to the Princess Gulrevaz, and said, “'T' is
Shagpat, exalted, clothed with majesty, O thou morning star
of Aklis !”

So, she said, “Koorookh is given thee, and waiteth to
carry ye both; and for me I will watch that this glass send
forth a beam to light ye to that city; so farewell, 0 thou
that art loved! And delay in nothing to finish the work in
hand.”
Now, when he had set his face from the Princess he
descended through the roof of the palace, and met the seven
youths returning, and they accompanied him through the halls
of the palace to that hall where the damsels had duped him.
He was mindful of his promise to the old man crowned, and
flashed the Sword a strong flash, so that he who looked on it
would be seared in the eyelashes. Then, the doors of the
recesses flew apart, eight-and-ninety in number, and he beheld
divers sitters on thrones, with the diadem of asses' ears
stiffened upright, and monkeys' skulls grinning with gems;
they having on each countenance the look of sovereigns and
the serenity of high estate. Now, Shibli Bagarag laughed at
them, and he thought, “ Wullahy! was I one of these? I,
the beloved of Noorna, destined Master of an Event!” and he
thought, “Of a surety, if these sitters could but laugh at
themselves, there would be a release for them, and the crown
would topple off which getteth the homage of asses and
monkeys!” He would have spoken to them, but the sons of
Aklis said, “They have seen the flashing of the Sword, and 't
were well they wake not.” So, as they went from the hall the
seven youths said, “Reflect upon the age of these sitters, that
have been sitting in the chairs from three to eleven generations
back! And they were searchers of the Sword like thee, but
were duped ! In like manner, the hen sitteth in complacency,
but she bringeth forth and may cackle ; 't is owing to the
aids of Noorna that thou art not one of these sitters, 0
Master of the Event !” Now, they paced through the hall
of dainty provender, and through the hall of the jewel-
fountains, coming to the palace steps, where stood A barak
leaning on his bar. As they advanced to Abarak, there was a
clamour in the halls behind him, that gathered in noise like :

a torrent, and approached, and presently he was ware of a
sharp stroke on his forehead with a hairy finger, and then a
burn, and the Crown that had clung to him toppled off !
surely it fell upon the head of the old monkey, the cautious
and wise one, he that had made a study of Shibli Bagarag!
So, thereupon that monkey stalked scornfully from them;
and Abarak cried, “O Master of the Event! it was better for
me to keep the passage of the Seventh Pillar, than be an
ape of this order. Wah! the flashing of the Sword scorcheth
them, and they scamper.”


## p. 216 (#230) ############################################

THE VEILED FIGURE.
Now, there was lightning in Aklis as Shibli Bagarag flashed
the sword over the clamouring beasts : the shape of the great
palace stood forth vividly, and a wide illumination struck up
the streams, and gilded the large hanging leaves, and drew the
hills glimmeringly together, and scattered fires on the flat
faces of the rocks. Then, the seven youths said quickly,
" Away! out of Aklis, O Master of the Event! from city to
city of earth this light is visible, and men will know that Fate
is in travail, and an Event preparing for them, and Shagpat
will be warned by the portent; wherefore lose not the happy
point of time on which thy star is manifest.” And they
cried again, “Away ! out of Aklis !” with gestures of im-
patience, urging his departure.
Then, said he, “O youths, Sons of Aklis, it is written
that gratitude is the poor man's mine of wealth, and the rich
man's flower of beauty; and I have but that to give ye for
all this aid and friendliness of yours.”
But they exclaimed, “No aid or friendliness in Aklis !
By the gall of the Roc! it is well for thee thou camest
armed with potent spells, and hadst one to advise and in-
spirit thee, or thou wouldst have stayed here to people Aklis,
and grazed in a strange shape."
Now, the seven waxed in impatience, and he laid their hands
upon his head and moved from them with Abarak, to where
in the dusk the elephant that had brought them stood. Then

217
the elephant kneeled and took the twain upon his back,
and bore them across the dark land to that reach of the
river where the boat was moored in readiness. So, they
entered the boat silently among its drapery of lotuses, and
the Veiled Figure ferried them over the stream that rippled
not with their motion. As they were crossing, desire to
know that Veiled Figure counselled Shibli Bagarag evilly
to draw the Sword again, and flash it, so that the veil
became transparent. Then, when Abarak turned to him
for the reason of the flashing of the Sword, he beheld
the eyes of the youth fixed in horror, glaring as at sights
beyond the tomb. He said nought, but as the boat's-head
whispered among the reeds and long flowers of the opposite
marge, he took Shibli Bagarag by the shoulders and pushed
him out of the boat, and leaped out likewise, leading him
from the marge forcibly, hurrying him forward from it, he
at the heels of the youth propelling him, and crying in a
husky, out-of-breath voice at intervals, “What sight? what
sight?” But the youth seemed powerless of speech, and
when at last he opened his lips, the little man shrank from
him, for he laughed as do the insane, a peal of laughter ended
by gasps; then a louder peal, presently softer; then a peal
that started all the echoes in Aklis. After awhile, as Abarak
still cried in his ear, “What sight?” he looked at him with a
large eye, saying querulously, “Is it written I shall be pushed
by the shoulder through life? And is it in the pursuit of
further thwackings ?”.
Abarak heeded him not, crying still, "What sight?” and
Shibli Bagarag lowered his tone, and jerked his body, pro-
nouncing the name “Rabesqurat !” Then Abarak exclaimed,
“'T is as I weened. Oh, fool! to flash the Sword and peer
through the veil! Truly, there be few wits will bear that
sight !” On a sudden he cried, “No cure but one, and that
a sleep in the bosom of the betrothed !”
Thereupon, he hurried on the youth yet faster across the
dark lawns of Aklis toward the passage of the Seventh Pillar,

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
by which the twain had entered that kingdom. And Shibli
Bagarag saw as in a dream the shattered door, shattered by
the bar, remembering dimly as a thing distant in years the
netting of the Queen, and Noorna chained upon the pillar;
he remembered Shagpat even vacantly in his mind, as one
sheaf of barley amid other sheaves of the bearded field, so
was he overcome by the awfulness of that sight behind the
veil of the Veiled Figure! Now, as they advanced to the
passage, he was aware of an impediment to its entrance,
as it had been a wall of stone there; and seeing Abarak
enter the passage without let, he kicked hard in front
at the invisible obstruction, but there was no coming
by. Then, Abarak returned to him, and took his right
arm, and raised the sleeve from his wrist, and lo, the
two remaining hairs of Garraveen twisted round it in
sapphire winds ! Cried he, “Oh, the generosity of Gulre-
vaz! she has left these two hairs that he may accomplish
swiftly the destiny marked for him! but now, since his gazing
through that veil, he must part with them to get out of
Aklis.” And he muttered, “His star is a strange one ! one
that leadeth him to fortune by the path of frowns! to great-
ness by the aid of thwackings ! Truly the ways of Allah are
wonderful !” Now, Shibli Bagarag resisted him in nothing,
and Abarak loosed the two bright hairs from his wrist, and
those two hairs swelled and took glittering scales, and were
sapphire snakes with wings of intense emerald ; and they
rose in the air spirally together, each over each, so that to see
them one would fancy in the darkness a fountain of sapphire
waters flashed with the sheen of emerald. When they had
reached a height loftier than the topmost palace-towers of
Aklis, they descended like javelins into the earth, and in a
moment re-appeared, in the shape of Genii when they are
charitably disposed to them they visit; not much above the
mortal size, not overbright, save for a certain fire in their
eyes when they turned them; and they were clothed each
from head to foot in an armour of sapphire plates shot with

219
steely emerald. Surely the dragon-fly that darteth all day in
the blaze over pools is like what they were. So, Abarak bit
his forefinger and said, “ Who be ye, O sons of brilliance ?”
They answered, “Karavejis and Veejravoosh, slaves of the
Sword.”
Then he said, “Come with us now, 0 slaves of the Sword,
and help us to the mountain of outer Aklis.”
They answered, “O thou, there be but two means for us of
quitting Aklis: on the wrist of the Master, or down the
blade of the Sword ! and from the wrist of the Master we
have been loosed, and no one of thy race can tie us to it
again.”
Now, Abarak said, “How then shall the Master leave
Aklis ?”
They answered, “By Allah in Aklis ! he can carve a way
whither he will with the Sword.”
But Abarak cried, “O Karavejis and Veejravoosh ! he hath
peered through the veil of the Ferrying Figure.”
Now, when they heard his words, the visages of the Genii
darkened, and they exclaimed sorrowfully, “Serve we such a
one ?”
And they looked at Shibli Bagarag a look of anger, so that
he, whose wits were in past occurrences, imagined them his
enemy and the foe of Noorna split in two, crying, “How?
Is Karaz a couple ? and do I multiply him with strokes of
the Sword ?”
Thereupon, he drew the Sword from his girdle in wrath,
flourishing it; and Karavejis and Veejravoosh felt the might
of the Sword, and prostrated themselves to the ground at his
feet. So, Abarak said, “Arise, and bring us swiftly to the
mountain of outer Aklis.”
Then said they, “Seek a passage down yonder brook in
the moonbeams; and it is the sole passage for him now.”
Abarak went with them to the brook that was making
watery music to itself between banks of splintered rock and
over broad slabs of marble, bubbling here and there about

the roots of large-leaved water-flowers, and catching the
mirrored moon of Aklis in whirls, breaking it in lances.
Then, they waded into the water knee-deep, and the two
Genii seized hold of a great slab of marble in the middle of
the water, and under was a hollow brimmed with the brook,
that the brook flowed over. Then the Genii said to Abarak,
“Plunge !" and they said the same to Shibli Bagarag. So,
the swayer of the Sword replied, as it had been a simple
occasion, a common matter, and a thing for the exercise of
civility,“ With pleasure and all willingness !” Thereupon,
he tightened his girth, and arrowing his two hands, flung up
his heels and disappeared in the depth, Abarak following.
Surely, those two went diving downward till it seemed to
each there was no bottom in the depth, and they would not
cease to feel the rushing of the water in their ears till the
time hoped for by mortals.

THE BOSOM OF NOORNA.
Now, while a thousand sparks of fire were bursting on the
sight of the two divers, and they speeded heels uppermost to
the destiny marked out for them by the premeditations of the
All-wise, lo! Noorna was on the mountain in outer Aklis
with Koorookh, waiting for the appearance of her betrothed,
Sword in hand. She saw beams from the blazing eye of
Aklis, and knew by the redness of it that one, a mortal, was
peering on the earth and certain of created things. So, she
waited awhile in patience for the return of her betrothed,
with the head of Koorookh in her lap, caressing the bird, and
teaching it words of our language ; and the bird fashioned its
bill to the pronouncing of names, such as “Noorna” and
“Feshnavat,” and “Goorelka"; and it said “Karaz," and stuck
not at the name “Shagpat,” and it learnt to say even “Shagpat
shall be shaved ! Shagpat shall be shaved !” but no effort of
Noorna could teach it to say, “Shibli Bagarag,” the bird
calling instead, “Shiparack, Shiplabarack, Shibblisharack.”
And Noorna chid it with her fore-finger, crying, “O Koo-
rookh! wilt thou speak all names but that one of my
betrothed ?”
So, she said again, “Shibli Bagarag," and the bird
answered, imitating its best, “Shibberacavarack.” Noorna
was wroth with it, crying, “Oh naughty bird ! is the name
of my beloved hateful to thee?"
· And she chid Koorookh angrily, he with a heavy eye sulking

and keeping the sullen feathers close upon his poll. Now, she
thought, “There is in this a meaning, and I will fathom it."
So, she counted the letters in the name of her betrothed, that
were thirteen, and spelt them backwards, afterwards multiply-
ing them by an equal number, and fashioning words from the
selection of every third and seventh letter. Then, took she
the leaf from a tree and bade Koorookh fly with her to the
base of the mountain sloping from Aklis to the sea, and
there wrote with a pin's point on the leaf the words fashioned,
dipping the leaf in the salt ripple by the beach, till they were
distinctly traced. And it was revealed to her that Shibli
Bagarag bore now a name that might be uttered by none, for
that the bearer of it had peered through the veil of the
ferrying figure in Aklis. When she knew that, her grief was
great, and she sat on the cold stones of the beach and among
the bright shells, weeping in anguish, loosing her hair, scat-
tering it. wildly, exclaiming, “Awahy! woe on me! Was.
ever man more tired than he before entering Aklis, he that
was in turns abased and beloved and exalted ! yet his weakness
clingeth to him, even in Aklis and with the Wondrous Sword
in his grasp.” Then, she thought, “Still he had strength to
wield the Sword, for I marked the flashing of it, and 'twas
he that leaned forward the blade to me; and he possessed the
qualities that bring one gloriously to the fruits of enterprise !"
And she thought, “Of a surety if Abarak be with him, and
a single of the three slaves of the Sword that I released from
the tail of Garraveen, Ravejoura, Karavejis, and Veejravoosh,
he will yet come through, and I may revive him in my bosom
for the task.” So, thinking upon that, the sweet crimson sur-
prised her cheeks, and she arose and drew Koorookh with her
along the beach till they came to some rocks piled ruggedly
and the waves breaking over them. Then, she mounted these,
and stepped across them to the entrance of a cavern, where
flowed a full water swiftly to the sea, rolling smooth bulks
over and over, and with a translucent light in each, showing
precious pebbles in the bed of the water below; agates

of size, limpid cornelians, plates of polished jet, rubies,
diamonds innumerable that were smitten into sheen by slant
rays of the level sun, the sun just losing its circle behind
lustrous billows of that Enchanted Sea. Now, she turned to
Koorookh a moment, saying with a coax of smiles, “Will my
bird wait here for me, even at this point ?" Koorookh clapped
both his wings, and she said again, petting him, “He will
keep watch to pluck me from the force of water as I roll
past, that I be not carried to the sea, and lost ?”
Koorookh still clapped his wings, and she entered under
the arch of the cavern. It was roofed with crystals, a sight
of glory, with golden lamps at intervals, still centres of a
thousand beams. Taking the sandal from her left foot and
tucking up the folds of her trousers to the bend of her clear
white knee, she advanced, half wading, up the winds of the
cavern, and holding by the juts of granite here and there, till
she came to a long straight lane in the cavern, and at the
end of it, far down, a solid pillar of many-coloured water that
fell into the current, as it had been one block of gleaming
marble from the roof, without ceasing. Now, she made
toward it, and fixed her eye warily wide on it, and
it was bright, flawless in brilliancy; but while she
gazed a sudden blot was visible, and she observed in
the body of the fall two dark objects plumping down-
ward one after the other, like bolts, and they splashed in
the current and were carried off by the violence of its sweep,
shooting by her where she stood, rapidly; but she, knotting
her garments round the waist to give her limbs freedom and
divine swiftness, ran a space, and then bent and plunged,
catching, as she rose, the foremost to her bosom, and whirled
away under the flashing crystals like a fish scaled with splen-
dours that hath darted and seized upon a prey, and is bearing
it greedily to some secure corner of the deeps to swallow the
quivering repast at leisure. Surely, the heart of Noorna was
wise of what she bore against her bosom ; and it beat exult-
ing strokes in the midst of the rush and roar and gurgle of

the torrent, and the gulping sounds and multitudinous out-
cries of the headlong water. That verse of the poet would
apply to her where he says:
Lead me to the precipice,
And bid me leap the dark abyss :
I care not what the danger be,
So my beloved, my beauteous vision,
Be but the prize I bear with me,
For she to Paradise can turn Perdition.
Praise be to him that planteth love, the worker of this mar-
vel, within us! Now, she sped in the manner narrated
through the mazes of the cavern, coming suddenly to the
point at the entrance where perched Koorookh gravely upon
one leg, like a bird with an angling beak: so, he caught at
her as she was hurling toward the sea, and drew her to the
bank of rock, that burden on her bosom ; and it was Shibli
Bagarag, her betrothed, his eyes closed, his whole
countenance colourless. Behind him like a shadow
streamed A barak, and Noorna kneeled by the waterside
and fetched the little man from it likewise ; he was
without a change, as if drawn from a familiar element;
and when he had prostrated himself thrice and called
on the Prophet's name in the form of thanksgiving, he
wrung his beard of the wet, and had wit to bless the action
of Noorna that saved him. Then, the two raised Shibli
Bagarag from the rock, and reclined him lengthwise under
the wings of Koorookh, and Noorna stretched herself there
beside him with one arm about his neck, the fair head of the
youth on her bosom. And she said to Abarak, “He hath
dreamed many dreams, my betrothed, but never one so sweet
as that I give him. Already, see, the hue returneth to his
cheek and the dimples of pleasure.” So was it; and she
said, “ Mount, O thou of the net and the bar ! and stride
Koorookh across the neck, for it is nigh the setting of the
moon, and by dawn we must be in our middle flight, seen of
men, a cloud over them."

225
Said Abarak, “To hear is to obey !”
Now, he strode the neck of Koorookh and sat with dangling
feet, till she cried, “Rise!” and the bird spread its wings
and flapped them wide, rising high in the silver rays, and
flying rapidly forward from the mountain in front of Aklis,
and the white sea with its enchanted isles and wonders ;
flying and soaring till the earth was as what might be held
in the hollow of the hand, and the kingdoms of the earth a
mingled heap of shining dust in the midst.


## p. 226 (#240) ############################################

THE REVIVAL.
Now, the feathers of Koorookh in his flight were ruffled by
a chill breeze, and they were speeding through a light glow
of cold rose-colour. Then, said Noorna, “ 'T is the messenger
of morning, the blush. Oh, what changes will date from
this day!”
The glow of rose became golden, and they beheld under-
neath them, on one side, the rim of the rising red sun, and
rays streaming over the earth and its waters. And Noorna
said, “I must warn Feshnavat, my father, and prepare him.
for our coming."
So, she plucked a feather from Koorookh and laid the
quill downward, letting it drop. Then, said she, “Now for
the awakening of my betrothed !”
Thereupon, she hugged his head a moment, and kissed him
on the eyelids, the cheeks, and the lips, crying, “By this
means only!” Crying that, she pushed him, sliding, from
the back of the bird, and he parted from them, falling head-
foremost in the air like a stricken eagle. Then, she called to
Koorookh, “Seize him !” and the bird slanted his beak and
closed his wings,—the two, Abarak and Noorna, clinging to
him tightly; and he was down like an arrow between Shibli
Bagarag and the ground, spreading beneath him like a tent,
and Noorna caught the youth gently to her lap; then, she
pushed him off again, intercepting his descent once more, till
they were on a level with one of the mountains of the earth,

from which the City of Shagpat is visible among the yellow
sands like a white spot in the yolk of an egg. So, by this
time the eyes of the youth gave symptoms of a desire to look
upon the things that be, peeping faintly beneath the lashes,
and she exclaimed joyfully, raising her white hands above
her head, “One plunge in the lake, and life will be his
again !”
Below them was a green lake, tinted by the dawn with
crimson and yellow, deep, and with high banks. As they
crossed it to the middle, she slipped off the youth from
Koorookh, and he with a great plunge was received into the .
stillness of the lake. Meanwhile, Koorookh quivered his
wings and seized him when he arose, bearing him to an end
of the lake, where stood one dressed like a Dervish, and it
was the Vizier Feshnavat, the Father of Noorna. So, when
he saw them, he shouted the shout of congratulation, catching
Noorna to his breast, and Shibli Bagarag stretched as doth a
heavy sleeper in his last doze, saying, in a yawning voice,
"What trouble? I wot there is nought more for us now that
Shagpat is shaved! Oh, I have had a dream, a dream! He
that is among Houris in Paradise dreameth not a dream like
that. And I dreamed 't is gone !"
Then, said he, staring at them, “Who be ye? What is
this?"
Noorna took him again to her bosom, and held him there ;
and she plucked a herb, and squeezed it till a drop from it fell
on either of his lids, applying to them likewise a dew from the
serpents of the Sword, and he awoke to the reality of things.
Surely, then he prostrated himself and repeated the articles of
his faith, taking one hand of his betrothed and kissing her ;
and he embraced Abarak and Feshnavat, saying to the father
of Noorna, “I know, O Feshnavat, that by my folly and
through my weakness I have lost time in this undertaking,
but it shall be short work now with Shagpat. This thy
daughter, the Eclipser of Reason, was ever such a prize as
she? I will deserve her. Wullahy! I am now a new man,

tain and Aklis, and brilliance. Lee two Genii, Kawiftly, like
sprung like fire from weak ashes. Lo, I am revived by her
for the great work."
Said Abarak: “O Master of the Event, secure now without
delay the two slaves of the Sword, and lean the blade
toward Aklis.”
Upon that, he ran up rapidly to the summit of the moun-
tain and drew the Sword from his girdle, and leaned it
toward Aklis, and it lengthened out over lands, the blade of
it a beam of solid brilliance. Presently, from forth the in-
visible remoteness they saw the two Genii, Karavejis and
Veejravoosh, and they were footing the blade swiftly, like
stars, speeding up till they were within reach of the serpents
of the hilt, when they dropped to the earth, bowing their
heads; so, he commanded them to rise, crying, “Search ye
the earth and its confines, and bring hither tidings of the
Genie Karaz.”
So they said, “To hear is to obey."
Then they began to circle each round the other, circling
more and more sharply till beyond the stretch of sight, and
Shibli Bagarag said to Feshnavat, “Am I not awake, O
Feshnavat? I will know where is Karaz ere I seek to operate
on Shagpat, for it is well spoken of the poet:
Obstructions first remove
Ere thou thy cunning prove;'
and I will encounter this Karaz that was our Ass, ere I try
the great shave. Tell me now what has happened in the city
while we were absent from it.”
Feshnavat replied, “O Master of the Event, my son, no
long story that." Then, when Shibli Bagarag had invested
himself in dry robes, and all were seated on the herbage, he
said : and mark ye:

THE
RECITAL OF THE VIZIER FESHNAVAT.
SURELY, as a river swelleth with the rains, the breath of
applause puffed Shagpat, and his arrogance increased, and he
was a very Nile-flood of presumption, swamping the city, so
that my Viziership made me a mark for his followers and
supporters, and the King regarded him with the eye of pre-
ference. So, I shivered in the shadow of neglect, waiting
till thy work was done and the Sword reached, to taste the
sweetness of revenge on Shagpat; patience with the plotter!
Now, there came on a certain day, and it was the day of the
New Year, one, a merchant, into the market-place of the City
where we were assembled, proclaiming a marvel, and it was a
lamp, the light of which none of the people could extinguish.
The merchant handed it to me, and I blew upon it, but still
it burned steadfast; then, the merchant held the lamp to the
mouth of Shagpat, and he blew, and lo, the flame vanished !
So, the people extolled Shagpat, and the merchant prostrated
himself, and said, “I know by this that there is holiness in
thee !"
Now, the merchant handed it to us again to bring back the
light, and none of us could bring it back save Shagpat, and
the merchant said, “How is it I marked not at a glance that
this man of the thick and lengthy growth was he that had
holiness in him ?” Then said he to the people, “Honour

him ye!” And he said to the King, “0 King, high in
majesty, potent! if the blaze of thy throne over kingdoms
and countries be now such as we see it, what would it be
were Shagpat at thy right hand, advising thee in the chair of
the Vizier ?”
Upon that, I was wroth, and sought the countenance of the
King, but he betrayed no discontent; so, I saw that the star
of Shagpat was in the ascendant—mine darkened by it.
Now, in this merchant I discovered the Genie Karaz, and
daily he did things in this wise to honour Shagpat in the
eyes of the people and abase me; yet was I patient and
awaited thy coming, O Master of the Event, to confound him.
Things were in that state when tidings were brought of a
barber that had been in Oolb, and had shaved the King and
his officers with a terrible tackle that talked and prophesied
shame to Shagpat, dishonour to him, and downfall, disgrace,
and vindictive shearing. Then I knew thou wert in part
triumphant by the aids of Noorna, my daughter, and that
Paravid and Garraveen would lead to the Lily, the Lily to
Aklis, Aklis to the consummation of vengeance and crowning
of Events on the head of Shagpat. Surely, the thought was
comfort, and the news intoxicated me, and I went forth
disguised and without companion, when the day had sunk, to
watch the effect of it on the people that stood in groups by
the doorways and met on the housetops, and collected on the
ways leading to the wells, discussing in alarm the case of
Oolb, and the Barber, and Shagpat.
Now, I was standing by the tall palm near the well
Eastward of the city, when I heard a sound of one that
approached in the dusk, mumbling sentences in the dialect
of Shiraz, grumbling as it seemed; and I heard him say, “A
curse on this capricious King of Oolb! Shaved is he? By
the tomb of my fathers, I 'll offer my skill nowhere save in
Shiraz after that, and they may languish for it the length of
the earth, and make offers for my service, yea, offers of pearls

for an essay of my science and an exposition of my cunning
on their frontispieces; yea and more, steeds they may offer
and golden tackle, yea, and princes shall woo me vainly,
proffering estates and mansions, with gardens and established
harems for but one operation of my hand upon them, and I'll
refuse, scorning them contumeliously-I—"
While the Vizier Feshnavat was reciting this soliloquy,
Shibli Bagarag burst in on his recital, crying, “ 'T was—and
I guess it, and wager on the guess, O Feshnavat !-Baba
Mustapha !”
Said Feshnavet, “ Even he ! how recognized you him ?”.
And Shibli Bagarag answered, “By his loquacity, his
lengthiness of tongue, his esteem of his science over all other
created things."
Then, the Vizier Feshnavat said, “O Master of the Event,
truly I could have laughed while this fellow mumbled, and I
should have roared with laughter, but that a thought
illumined my brain and lighted a path up the intricacies of
action, solving perplexity; and I rushed upon him, and seized
him, exclaiming, “In the name of Shagpat!”.
So, he fell on the knees of remonstrance, and lifted the
hands of imploring; and I said, “Thou art a barber! confess
that thing !"
Then, he stammered with what speech was his, and I com-
manded him imperiously to follow me, and took him before
the King, and accused him in the King's chamber of audience
of the crime of barbercraft, and of being the barber that had
shaved the King of Oolb and the officers of his Court, and
the viziers and emirs, and grave magistrates and cadis and
shahids, and lesser personages of the Court and City of Oolb.
So, he denied this, and I continued to accuse him, the poor
wretch! And his journeys were traced by Arabs from the
gates of Oolb, his case a clear case of barbercraft proved upon

him; and I was extolled for my zeal, praised, and in favour
again, as is said by the poet:
Nature's ordinance is sad !
Each preys on each, as 't would appear :
Thy saneness driveth neighbours mad,
Their smiles cause thee a tear.
And he says:
When one is down, the other 's up;
We're brothers only in the cup.
“Wherefore,” he says, “drink ye, and fatten in merriment, O
ye of humankind !” and this I said to Baba Mustapha when
he had received plenteous thwackings, touched with pity for
his state ; but he refused consolation, dwelling in verse on the
delights of Shiraz, the honours awarded to barbercraft there.
Now, on a day, as he paced the felons' prison in a moment of
dejection, I was by, and heard him call on the name of Shibli
Bagarag as one absent, missing, and to whom he was indebted
for divers thwackings, ignominies, and maltreatments : so, I
said to him, “What of the youth Shibli Bagarag?"
And he answered, “This of him, O Vizier: that but for
him and my search after him, I were now in the centre of
the adulations of Shiraz; the good-for-nothing fellow! he
whom the Evil One possessed with the idea of arriving at
great things,—and the readers of planets! And but for him
and his wilfulness, and his wandering and his accursed
ambition and dissatisfaction with his born state, the head
of the Shah, the high potentate, sovereign of the earth, that
head which blindeth men, were even now a familiar thing
beneath my hands, I operating on him, pouring honeyed
gossip in his ear, sweet scandal, laughable anecdotes,
recitations."
Then, he began to hint at what would be the wrath of the
King of Persia when he came to hear of the treatment re-
ceived by his chief barber at the hands of them of our city.
Surely, his tongue was a watermill, and wagged on all themes

and subjects; and I let him relieve his soul with this prate,
till he told of the relationship between ye. Thereat, my con-
science smote me on the rib with compassion for him, and I
had him released, and conveyed to me secretly, and fed him,
clothed him, filled him with comfort; relating to him that
portion of thy adventures known to me, O Master of the
Event; and of thy betrothal to my daughter Noorna, and of
thy destiny that led thee through dangers, enchantments,
privations, amazing marvels, to the Shaving of Shagpat. So,
hearing this, he gave praise to the readers of planets, and
cried extemporaneously and in seemly verse :
We mortals, that know not the stars and their doings,
Complain when annoy'd in our warrings and wooings;
But, oh, could we read them, their mysteries tracking,
Like birds in the rain we should sing through each thwacking.
· Wullahy! scarce could I restrain him from flying at Shagpat
that instant; and it required abundance of quotation from
what the sages have bequeathed to us in matters of experience
and wisdom, and lively illustrations, forcible appeals, to hold
him back. Now, till his excitement abated I kept him by me.
Then, I gave him porter's work, and he did me commissions,
faithfully, with zeal, and a tongue that ceased not to rattle on
all but the forbidden business. So it was that, after Time,
the father of changes, had flown some while without seed of
circumstance, one night Baba Mustapha failed to return, and
the next and that following; and I was in fear lest aught had
befallen him. It was on the fourth morning that I descended
early to the silver hall of my palace, and lo! suddenly one
that rushed into it like a quarry seeking shelter, pale of face,
and turban awry; and he rushed to the fountain and dipped
his head therein, and was clearly a man that wished to certify
to himself the fact of his existence in this world. Now, when
he looked up, I saw that it was Baba Mustapha, and that in
his absence he had mixed with terrors and drunk of the waters
of tribulation. So, I cried to him, “Ho! Baba Mustapha !”

but he took no heed of me, and looked with the eye of a
sheep. I examined him, and there were marks upon him of
fresh castigation. Then, I perceived that he had fallen into
the hands of the inimical, who had chased his wits from their
habitations : so, to revive his spirit and bring speech to his
lips, I sent to the meat-market and bought a sheep whole and
unsheared, remembering what is said, “The habitations of the
wits are habits;" and I had the sheep placed before Baba Mus-
tapha, beside him tackle and soap for the soaping preparatory
to the shave, to tempt him to action; praise be to thy craft,
O Master of the Event! For awhile, he recognized not this;
but presently the uses of the barber warmed in him and
thawed forgetfulness; and my conception of his case and the
remedy was perfect, for he seized the tackle, and commenced
soaping the sheep dreamily; then, with a livelier hand;
then, with a hand of vigour; then, fiercely; then, so that
his hand was like a wind, wild as a fly, swift as a wheel,
invisible in motion; he crying, “I have thee, Shagpat! I
have thee!” crying, “What ! thou and thy creatures deluded
me! Wullahy! this is vengeance, this !” crying, “Even
without the aid of the Sword my nephew seeketh at such a
risk, trouble, labour !” Then, he began to shave the sheep,
putting forth all his science and dexterity, vainly turning his
wrist, elevating the bend of his elbow, tenderly handling the
animal while his blade swept over it. Never, I wot, was
sheep-shearing performed with that extreme of care and
skill! So, when 't was done, I watched him, and he collected
the wool under one arm, and breathed a deep inflation; and
he was as if too light on his feet for the earth he trod, his
head menacingly challenging the remoteness of the four
quarters of the universe for one equal to him in the thing he
had achieved. Wah! 't was a madness of laughter to look
upon him. Then, on a sudden he cried, addressing himself
proudly, “Proclaim Shagpat shaved !” and lo! ere I could
divine his purpose and arrest him, he slanted swiftly from
the hall, and his heels were twinkling beyond the portals

of the palace, and up the street toward the market-place.
Awahy! then was I in the abysms of despair, and saw myself
no match for the ills that threatened, for he was shouting of
Shagpat publicly, proclaiming Shagpat shaved, and by his
hand, the hand of Baba Mustapha, in the house of Feshnavat
the Vizier; and that ’t was the fallen crop of Shagpat he
held beneath his arm, even that, a glory of barbercraft !
Truly, his wits were traitors to the tender parts of him, and
he was confounded ere the setting of that day's sun, con-
fronted with Shagpat in his splendour and his gravity, and
his enveloping hairiness and his umbrageous growths! Then
was he thwacked by order of the King till the flesh of his
back was hillocky with purple weals, and he, a moving mass
of aches and stings and shooting pains and throbs of un-
pleasantness, thrust from the gates of the City. The matter
was so with Baba Mustapha ; but as for how the matter went
with me,'t is certain I was haled to the presence of the King,
and denials, protestations, assertions went for nothing; the
barber was tracked from my palace, and the wife of Shagpat,
she that adoreth him, Kadza, this woman and another, an old
woman, a veritable hag, thrice hideous, a mockery of the
putting together of flesh and bones, with skin like a frog,
throat like a pelican, legs like a peacock, back like a
camel-
Cried Noorna bin Noorka, “Goorelka of Oolb!”
So, the Vizier Feshnavat continued : 'T is the thing that
might be! She, then, this crone, swore to my plotting with
Baba Mustapha, made oath to my conspiracies against Shag-
pat, and that I, my emissaries and I, had many times as-
saulted the holy man of late, tugged at him by the beard and
back-hair, offended his vision with insolent flourishings of
the apparatus of barbercraft,—all this; and that upon one
occasion I had forced an entrance to him in his shop-front
after dusk, when the people were retiring from their observa-
tion of Shagpat, and compelled him to submit to the lather,
purposing to have him shaved. - They said, “ Thereat mark

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
a wonder of special grace and protection accorded to Shagpat,
and the care of him exercised by Genii, 0 King of this City;
for the blade of the barber in its contact with the first hair
broke, fell in twain, and the edge of it became blunter than
a date-stone!”
The King exclaimed, “ 'T is wondrous ! Wullahy! We
will have it announced to them of Oolb, the shorn, the self-
abased, the tackle-contaminated ones; and I will have it
written on tablets of virgin silver in gold letters, that time
hereafter may read of Shagpat, the unparalleled, and the care
of him exercised by Genii. Wullahy! he reflecteth honour
on the throne itself. My Vizier is he!”
Now, this false-speaking prevailed, and a day was fixed for
my degradation before the people, and 't was to be a day of
exaltation for Shagpat. Dust was in the eyes of the King,
wool in his ears, oblivion of long services in his heart! Me-
thinketh likewise, O Master of the Event, that his conduct
to me was seasoned with folly and small reading of that
which futurity bringeth forth. I was disgraced, th wacked
with the thong; Shagpat exalted, enjoying my viziership
taken from me, and men made foolish-ruined by him. I
was left not even in possession of the palace in which I
abode. What a day was that !
Cried Shibli Bagarag, “O Feshnavat, 't was not a day
veiled from me, and I saw it, thee, and him.”
So Feshnavat said, “How? From what point of view,
O Master of the Event?”
He answered, “From Aklis, through the eye of Aklis.”
So, Feshnavat said, “Wondrous must be that eye !"
He replied, “All things be wondrous in Aklis.” Then,
said he, turning quickly, “Yonder is the light from Aklis
striking on the city, and I mark Shagpat, even he, illumined
by it, singled out, where he sitteth on the roof of the palace
by the market-place.”
So, they looked, and it was as he had spoken, that
Shagpat was singled out in the midst of the city by the

wondrous beams of the eye of Aklis, and made prominent
in effulgence.
Said Abarak, climbing to the level of observation, “He
hath a redness like the inside of a halved pomegranate.”
Feshnavat stroked his meditative chin, exclaiming, “He
may be likened to a mountain goat in the midst of a forest
roaring with conflagration.”
Said Shibli Bagarag, “Now is he the red-maned lion, the
bristling boar, the uncombed buffalo, the plumaged cock, but
soon will he be like nothing else save the wrinkled kernel of
a shaggy fruit, diminished, weazen, bitter. Lo, now, the
Sword ! mark ye? it leapeth to be at him, and 'twill be as
the keen icicle of winter to that perishing foliage, that doomed
crop! So doth the destined minute destroy with a flash
the hoarded arrogance of ages; and the destined hand doeth
what creation failed to perform ; and 't is by order, destiny,
and preordainment, that the works of this world come to
pass. This know I, and I witness thereto, that am of a
surety ordained to the Shaving of Shagpat!”
Then, he stood apart and gazed from Shagpat to the city
that now began to move with the morning; elephants and
coursers saddled by the gates of the King's palace were
visible, and camels blocking the narrow streets, and the
markets bustling. Surely, though the sun illumined that
city, it was as a darkness behind Shagpat singled by the
beams of Aklis !


## p. 238 (#252) ############################################

THE PLOT.
Now, while Shibli Bagarag gazed on Shagpat kindled by the
beams of Aklis, lo, the Genii Karavejis and Veejravoosh
circling each other in swift circles like two sapphire rings
toward him, and they whirled to a point above his head,
and fell and prostrated themselves at his feet: so, he cried,
“O ye slaves of the Sword, my servitors ! how of the where.
about of Karaz?”
They answered, “O Master of the Event, we found him
after many circlings far off, and 't was by the borders of the
Putrid Sea. We came not close on him, for he is stronger
than we without the Sword, but it seemed he was distilling
drops of an oil from certain substances, large thickened drops
that dropped into a phial.”
So, when they had spoken, Shibli Bagarag turned to the
Vizier Feshnavat and exclaimed urgently, “Thy service in
this enterprise even to the death ?”.
Feshnavat replied, “ Even so far !”
Then, Shibli Bagarag said, “The season of weakness with
me is over, and they that confide in my strength, my cunning,
my watchfulness, my wielding of the Sword, have nought to
fear for themselves. Now, this is my plot, O Feshnavat, -
that part of it in which thou art to have a share. 'T is that
thou depart forthwith to the city yonder, and enter thy
palace by a back entrance, and I will see that thou art
joined within an hour of thy arrival there by Baba Mustapha,
my uncle, the gabbler. Now, thy task is then to induce him

THE PLOT.
239
to make an attempt on the head of Shagpat in all wiliness, as
he and thou think well to devise. He will fail, as I know,
but what is that saying of the poet ?
*Persist, if thou wouldst truly reach thine ends,
For failures oft are but advising friends.'
And he says :
* Every failure is a step advanced,
To him who will consider how it chanced.'
Wherefore, will I that this attempt be made, keeping the
counsel that is mine. Now, thou must tell Baba Mustapha
I wait without the city to reward him by my powers of
reward with all that he best loveth. So, when he has
failed in his attempt on Shagpat, and blows fall plenteously
upon him, and he is regaled with the familiar thong, the
accustomed thwacking, do thou waste no further word on
him, for his part is over, and as is said :
Waste not a word in enterprise !
Against-or for-the minute flies.'
'T is then for thee, O Feshnavat, to speed to the presence of
the King in his majesty, and thou wilt find means of coming
to him by a disguise. Once in the Hall of Council, proclaim
to the King, before his officers and his court, Shagpat shaved !
Terrible, I foresee the tumult! He will menace the pro-
claimer; but be thou steadfast in the assertion, even as a
rock in the descent of the torrent, stemming it amidst uproar
and wrath and riot; yea, glue the soles of thy feet to the
marble flooring, and stand singly there denouncing Shagpat,
challenging the tongue of contradiction, daring the Court to
prove him by demonstration other than an impostor. 'T will
then hap that the King angrily issues his mandate for the
confronting of thee with Shagpat, thou being under sentence
in case of calumny. Then, will Shagpat appear: a time of
triumph for him, an hour of glory, a vanity divine; his
last.”

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Quoth Feshnavat plaintively, after a pause, “ And I, O
Master of the Event?”.
Shibli Bagarag continued, “Thou? Is there a distance
can hide from the edge of this blade,-an obstruction to
impede it? The clutch of the executioner will be upon thee,
O Feshnavat, and a clamouring multitude around; short
breathing-time given thee, O father of Noorna, ere the time
of breathing is commanded to cease. Now, in that respite
the thing that will occur, 't is for thee to see and mark; sure,
never will reverse of things be more complete, and the other
side of the picture more rapidly exhibited, if all go as I con-
ceive and plot, and the trap be not premature nor too perfect
for the trappers ; as the poet has declared :
‘Ye that intrigue, to thy slaves proper portions adapt;
Perfectest plots burst too often, for all are not apt.'
And I witness likewise to the excellence of his saying :
"To master an Event,
Study men!
The minutes are well spent
Only then.'
Also 't is he that says :
"The man of men who knoweth men, the Man of men is he !
His army is the human race, and every foe must flee.'
So have I apportioned to thee thy work, to Baba Mustapha
his; reserving to myself the work that is mine!”
Thereat, Feshnavat exclaimed, “O Master of the Event,
may I be thy sacrifice ! on my head be it! and for thee to
command is for me to obey ! but surely, this Sword of thine
that is in thy girdle, the marvellous blade—'t is alone equal
to the project and the shave ; and the matter might be con-
summated, the great thing done, even from this point whence
we behold Shagpat visible, as 't were brought forward to-
ward us by the beams! And this Sword swayed by thee,
and with thy skill and strength and the hardihood of hand

that is thine, wullahy! 't would shear him now, this moment,
taking the light of Aklis for a lather.”
Shibli Bagarag knotted the brows of impatience, crying,
“Hast thou forgotten Karaz in thy calculations? I know of
a surety what this Sword will do, and I wot the oil he
distilleth strengtheneth Shagpat but against common blades.
Yet shall it not be spoken of me, Shibli Bagarag, that I was
tripped by my own conceit; the poet counselleth :
'When for any mighty end thou hast the aid of Heaven,
Mount until thy strength shall match those great means which
are given :'
nor that I was overthrown in despising mine enemy, forget-
ful of the saying of the sage :
'Read the features of thy foe, wherever he may find thee,
Small he is, seen face to face, but thrice his size behind thee.'
Wullahy! this Karaz is a Genie of craft and resources, one
of a mighty stock, and I must close with Shagpat to be sure
of him; and that I am not deceived by semblances, opposing
guile with guile, and guile deeper than his, for that he
awaiteth it not, thinking I have leaped in fancy beyond the
Event, and am puffed by the after-breaths of adulation, I!-
thinking I pluck the blossoms in my hunger for the fruit,
thinking I eat the chick of the yet unlaid egg, O Feshnavat.
As is said, and the warrior beareth witness to the wisdom
of it:
‘His weapon I'll study, my own conceal;
So with two arms to his one shall I deal.'
The same also testifieth :
"T is folly of the hero, though resistless in the field,
To stake the victory on his steel, and fling away the shield.'
And likewise :
*Examine thine armour in every joint,
For slain was the Giant, and by a pin's point.'
Wah! 't is certain there will need subtlety in this under-

taking, and a plot plotted, so, do thou my bidding, and fail
not in the part assigned to thee.”
Now, Feshnavat was persuaded by his words, and cried,
“In diligence, discretion, and the virtues which characterize
subordinates, I go, and I delay not ! I will perform the
thing required of me, O Master of the Event.” And he
repeated in verse :
With danger beset, be the path crooked or narrow,
Thou art the bow, and I the arrow.
Then, embraced he his daughter, kissing her on the fore-
head and the eyes, and tightening the girdle of his robe,
departed, with the name of Allah on his lips, in the direction
of the City.
So, Shibli Bagarag called to him the two Genii, and his
command was, “Soar, ye slaves of the Sword, till the range
of earth and its mountains and seas and deserts are a cluster
in the orb of the eye, Shiraz conspicuous as a rose among
garlands, and the ruby consorted with other gems in a setting.
In Shiraz or the country adjoining ye will come upon one Baba
Mustapha by name; and, if he be alone, ye may recognize him
by his forlorn look and the hang of his cheeks, his vacancy as
of utter abandonment; if in company, 't will be the only talker
that 's he; seize on him, give him a taste of thin air, and
deposit him without speech on the roof of a palace, where ye
will see Feshnavat in yonder city: this do ere the shadows
of the palm-tree by the well in the plain move up the mounds
that enclose the fortified parts.”
Cried Karavejis and Veejravoosh, “To hear is to obey."
Up into the sky, like two bright balls tossed by jugglers,
the two Genii shot; and, watching them, Noorna bin Noorka
said, “My life, there is a third wanting, Ravejoura; and with
aid of the three, earth could have planted no obstruction to
thy stroke; but thou wert tempted by the third temptation in
Aklis, and left not the Hall in triumph, the Hall of the Duping
Brides !"

He answered, “That is so, my soul; and the penalty is
mine, by which I am made to employ deceits ere I strike.”
And she said, "'T is to the generosity of Gulrevaz thou
owest Karavejis and Veejravoosh ; and I think she was
generous, seeing thee true to me in love, she that hath
Sorrotou, seeing thee true ivoosh; and I thinthevaz thou
So, he said, “What of the sorrows of Gulrevaz? Tell me
of them.”
But she said, “Nay, O my betrothed ! would'st thou have
this tongue blistered, and a consuming spark shot against
this bosom?”
Then, he: “Make it clear to me.”
She put her mouth to his ear, saying, “There is a curse on
whoso telleth of things in Aklis, and to tattle of the Seven
and their sister forerunneth wretchedness.”
Surely, he stooped to that fair creature, and folded her to
his heart passionately, his whole soul heaving to her; and he
cried again and again, “Shall harm hap to thee through me!
by Allah, no!”
And he closed the privileged arm of the bridegroom round
her unresisting waist, that had the yieldingness of the willow-
branchlet, the flowingness of the summer sea-wave, and
seemed as 't were melting honey-like at the first gentle
pressure ; she leaning her head shyly on his shoulder, shyly,
yet confiding in his faithfulness; it was that she was shy of
the great bliss in her bosom, and was made timid by the
fervour of her affection; as is sung :
Deeper than the source of blushes
Is the power that makes them start;
Up in floods the red stream rushes,
At one wbisper of the heart.
And it is sung in words present to the youth as he surveyed
her:
O beauty of the bride! O beauty of the bride !
Her bashful joys like serpents sting her tenderness to tears :
Her hopes are sleeping eagles in the shining of the spheres ;
O beauty of the bride ! O beauty of the bride!

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
And she's a lapping antelope that from her image flees ;
And she's a dove caught in two bands, to pant as she shall please;
O beauty of the bride ! O beauty of the bride!
Like torrents over Paradise her lengthy tresses roll :
She moves as doth a swaying rose, and chides ber hasty soul,
The thing she will, that will she not, yet can no will control :
O beauty, beauty, beauty of the bride!
They were thus together, Abarak leaning under one wing
of Koorookh for shade up the slope of the hill, and Shibli
Bagarag called to him, “Ho, Abarak ! look if there be aught
impending over the City.”
So, he arose and looked, crying, “One with plunging legs,
high up in air over the City, between two bright bodies.”
Shibli Bagarag exclaimed, “'T is well! The second chapter
of the Event is opened; so call it, thou that tellest of the
Shaving of Shagpat. It will be the shortest.”
Then, he said, “The shadow of yonder palm is now a
slanted spear up the looped wall of the City. Now, the time
of Shagpat's triumpb, and his greatest majesty, will be when
yonder walls chase the shadow of the palm up this hill; and
then will Baba Mustapha be joining the chorus of creatures
that shriek towards even ere they snooze. There 's not an
ape in the woods, nor hyæna in the forest, nor birds on the
branches, nor frogs in the marsh that will outnoise Baba
Mustapha under the thong! Wullahy, 't will grieve his soul
in aftertime when he sitteth secure in honours, courted, with
a thousand ears at his bidding, that so much breath 'scaped
him without toll of the tongue! But as the poet says truly :
The chariot of Events lifteth many dusty heels,
And many, high and of renown, it crusheth with its wheels.'
Wah! I have had my share of the thong, and am I, Master
of the Event, to be squeamish in attaining an end by its
means? Nay, by this Sword !”
Thereat, he strode once again to the summit of the hill,
and in a moment the Genii fronted him like two shot arrows
quivering from the flight. So, he cried, “Is it done?”

THE PLOT.

They answered, “In faithfulness.”
So, he beckoned to Noorna, and she came forward swiftly
to him, exclaiming, “I read the plot, and the thing required
of me; so, say nought, but embrace me ere I leave thee, O
my betrothed, my master !”
He embraced her, and led her to where the Genii stood.
Then, said he to the Genii, “Convey her to the City, O ye
slaves of the Sword, and watch over her there. If ye let but
an evil wind ruffle the hair of her head, lo ! I'll sever ye with
a stroke that shaketh the under worlds. Remain by her till
the shrieks of Baba Mustapha greet ye, and then will follow
commotion among the crowd, and cries for Shagpat to show
himself to the people, cries also of death to Feshinavat; and
there will be an assembly in the King's hall of justice; thither
lead ye my betrothed, and watch over her.” And he said to
Noorna, “Thou knowest my design ?”
So, she said, “When condemnation is passed on Feshnavat,
that I appear in the hall as bride of Shagpat, and so rescue
him that is my father.” And she cried, “Oh, fair delightful
time that is coming ! my happiness and thy honour on earth
dateth from it. Farewell, O my betrothed, beloved youth !
Eyes of mine! these Genii will be by, and there's no cause
for fear or sorrow, and 't is for thee to look like morning that
speeds the march of light. Thou, my betrothed, art thou not
all that enslaveth the heart of woman?”
Cried Shibli Bagarag, “And thou, () Noorna, all that en-
raptureth the soul of man! Allah keep thee, my life!”
Lo! while they were wasting the rich love in their hearts,
the Genii rose up with Noorna, and she, waving her hand to
him, was soon distant and as the white breast of a bird turned
to the sun. Then went he to where Abarak was leaning, and
summoned Koorookh, and the twain mounted him, and rose
up high over the City of Shagpat to watch the ripening of the
Event, as a vulture watcheth over the desert.

THE DISH OF POMEGRANATE GRAIN.
Now, in the City of Shagpat, Kadza, spouse of Shagpat, she
that had belaboured Shibli Bagarag, had a dream while these
things were doing; and it was a dream of danger and portent
to the glory of her eyes, Shagpat. So, at the hour when he
was revealed to Shibli Bagarag, made luminous by the beams
of Aklis, Kadza went to an inner chamber, and greased her
hands and her eyelids, and drank of a phial, and commenced
tugging at a brass ring fixed in the floor, and it yielded and
displayed an opening, over which she stooped the upper half
of her leanness, and pitching her note high, called “Karaz!”
After that, she rose and retreated from the hole hastily, and
in the winking of an eye it was filled, as 't were a pillar of
black smoke, by the body of the Genie, he breathing hard
with mighty travel. So, he cried to her between his pantings
and puffings, “Speak! where am I wanted, and for what?”
Now, Kadza was affrighted at the terribleness of his
manner, and the great smell of the Genie was an intoxica-
tion in her nostril, so that she reeled and could just falter out,
“Danger to the Identical !”
Then he, in a voice like claps of thunder, “Out with it!”
She answered beseechingly, “ 'T is a dream I had, O Genie ;
a dream of danger to him.”
While she spake, the Genie clenched his fists and stamped
so that the palace shook and the earth under it, exclaiming,
“O abominable Kadza! a dream is it? another dream? Wilt

thou cease dreaming awhile, thou silly woman? Know I not
he that's powerful against us is in Aklis, crowned ape, and
that his spells are gone. And I was distilling drops to defy
the Sword and strengthen Shagpat from assault, yet bringest
thou me from my labour by the Putrid Sea with thy accursed
dream !” Thereat, he frowned and shot fire at her from his
eyes, so that she singed, and the room thickened with a
horrible smell of burning. She feared greatly and trembled,
but he cooled himself against the air, crying presently in a
diminished voice, “Let's hear this dream, thou foolish Kadza!
’T is as well to hear it. Probably Rabesqurat hath sent thee
some sign from Aklis, where she ferryeth a term. What 's
that saying:
A woman 's at the core of every plot man plotteth,
And like an ill-reared fruit, first at the core it rotteth.'
So, out with it, thou Kadza !”
Now, the urgency of that she had dreamed overcame fear
in Kadza, and she said, “O great Genie and terrible, my
dream was this. Lo! I saw an assemblage of the beasts of
the forests and them that inhabit wild places. And there was
the elephant and the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus, and
the camel and the camelopard, and the serpent and the striped
tiger; also the antelope, the hyæna, the jackal, and above
them, eminent in majesty, the lion. Surely, he sat as 't were
on a high seat, and they like suppliants thronging the pre-
sence: this saw I, the heart on my ribs beating for Shagpat.
And there appeared among the beasts a monkey all ajoint
with tricks, jerking with malice, he looking as 't were hungry
for the doing of things detestable; and the lion scorned him,
and I marked him ridicule the lion : 't was so. And the lion
began to scowl, and the other beasts marked the displeasure
of the lion. Then chased they that monkey from the presence,
and for awhile he was absent, and the lion sat in his place
gravely, with calm, receiving homage of the other beasts; and
down to his feet came the eagle that's lord of air, and before

him kneeled the great elephant, and the subtle serpent eyed
him with awe. But soon did that monkey, the wretched
animal ! reappear, and there was no peace for the lion, he
worrying till close within stretch of the lion's paw! Wah!
the lion might have crushed him, but that he's magnani-
mous. And so it was that as the monkey advanced the lion
roared to him, 'Begone!'
“ And the monkey cried, 'Who commandeth ?'
“So the lion roared, 'The King of beasts, and thy King!'
“Then, that monkey cried, 'Homage to the King of
beasts, and my King! Allah keep him in his seat, and I
would he were visible.'
“So, the lion roared, 'He sitteth here acknowledged, thou
graceless animal ! and he's before thee apparent.'
“Then, the monkey affected eagerness, and gazed about
him, and peered on this beast, and on that, exclaiming like
one that 's injured and under slight, 'What's this I've done,
and wherein have I offended, that he should be hidden from
me when pointed out ?'
“So, the lion roared, ''T is I where I sit, thou offensive
monkey!'
“Then, that monkey in the upper pitch of amazement,
Thou! Is it for created thing to acknowledge a king without
a tail ? And, O beasts of the forest and the wilderness, how
say ye? Am I to blame that I bow not to one that hath it
not?'
“Upon that, the lion rose, and roared in the extreme of
wrath ; but the word he was about to utter was checked in
him, for 't was manifest that where he would have lashed a
tail he shook a stump, wagging it as the dog doth. Lo !
when the lion saw that, the majesty melted from him, and in
a moment the plumpness of content and prosperity forsook
him, so that his tawny skin hung flabbily and his jaw drooped,
and shame deprived him of stateliness; abashed was he! Now,
seeing the lion shamed in this manner, my heart beat violently
for Shagpat, so that I awoke with the strength of its beating,

THE DISH OF POMEGRANATE GRAIN. 249
and 't was hidden from me whether the monkey was punished
by the lion, or exalted by the other beasts in his place, or how
came it that the lion's tail was lost, witched from him by
that villain of mischief, the monkey ; but, O great Genie, I
knew there was a lion among men, reverenced, and with
enemies; that lion, he that espoused me, and my glory,
Shagpat! 'T was enough to know that and tremble at the
omen of my dream, 0 Genie. Wherefore, I thought it well
to summon thee here, that thou mightest set a guard over
Shagpat, and shield him from the treacheries that beset
him."
When Kadza had ceased speaking, the Genie glowered at
her awhile in silence. Then said he, “What creature is
that, 0 Kadza, which tormenteth like the tongue of a
woman, is small as her pretensions to virtue, and which
showeth how the chapters of her history should be read by
the holy ones, even in its manner of movement ?”
Cried Kadza, “ The flea that hoppeth!”
So, he said, “'T is well! Hast thou strength to carry one
of my weight, O Kadza ?”
She answered in squeamishness, “I, wullahy! I 'm but a
woman, O Genie, though the wife of Shagpat: and to carry
thee is for the camel and the elephant and the horse.”
Then he, “ Tighten thy girdle, and when tightened, let a
loose loop hang from it."
She did that, and he gave her a dark powder in her hand,
saying, “Swallow the half of this, and what remaineth mix
with water, and sprinkle over thee.”
That did she, and thereupon he exclaimed, “Now go, and
thy part is to move round Shagpat; and a wind will strike
thee from one quarter, and from which quarter it striketh is
the one of menace and danger to Shagpat.”
So, Kadza was diligent in doing what the Genie com-
manded, and sought for Shagpat, and moved round him
many times; but no wind struck her. She went back to the
Genie, and told him of this, and the Genie cried, “What ?

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
no wind ? not one from Aklis? Then will Shagpat of a
surety triumph, and we with him.”
Now, there was joy on the features of Kadza and Karaz,
till suddenly he said, “ Halt in thy song ! How if there be
danger and menace above ? and 't is the thing that may be.”
Then, he seized Kadza, and slung her by him, and went
into the air, and up it till the roofs of the City of Shagpat
were beneath their feet, all on them visible. And under
an awning, and the roof of a palace, there was the Vizier
Feshnavat and Baba Mustapha, they ear to lip in con-
sultation, and Baba Mustapha brightening with the matter
revealed to him, and bobbing his head, and breaking on
the speech of the Vizier. Now, when he saw them the
Genie blew from his nostrils a double stream of darkness
which curled in a thick body round and round him, and
Kadza slung at his side was enveloped in it, as with folds
of a huge serpent. Then, the Genie hung still, and lo! two
radiant figures swept toward the roof he watched, and between
them Noorna bin Noorka, her long dark hair borne far back-
ward, and her robe of silken stuff fluttering and straining on
the pearl buttons as she flew. There was that in her beauty
and the silver clearness of her temples and her eyes, and her
cheeks, and her neck, and chin and ankles, that made the
Genie shudder with love of her, and he was nigh dropping
Kadza to the ground, forgetful of all else save Noorna.
When he recovered, and it was by tightening his muscles till
he was all over hard knots, Noorna was seated on a cushion,
and descending he heard her speak his name. Then, sniffed
he the air, and said to Kadza, “O spouse of Shagpat, a plot
breweth, and the odour of it is in my nostril. Fearest thou
a scorching for his sake thou adorest, the miracle of men ?”
She answered, “On my head be it, and my eyes !”
So, he said, “I shall alight thee behind the pole of awning
on yonder roof, where are the two bright figures and the dingy
one, and the Vizier Feshnavat and Noorna bin Noorka. A
flame will spring up severing thee from them; but thou 'rt

secure from it by reason of the powder I gave thee, all save
the hair that's on thee. Thou 'lt have another shape than that
which is thine, even that of a slave of Noorna bin Noorka, and
say to her when she asketh thy business with her, 'O my
mistress, let the storm gather-in the storm-bird when it
would surprise men.' Do this, and thy part's done, O Kadza!”
Thereupon, he swung a circle, and alighted her behind the
pole of awning on the roof, and vanished, and the circle of
flame rose up, and Kadza passed through it slightly scorched,
and answered to the question of Noorna, “O my mistress, let
the storm gather-in the storm-bird when it would surprise.
men.” Now, when Noorna beheld her, and heard her voice,
she pierced the disguise, and was ware of the wife of Shagpat,
and glanced her large eyes over Kadza from head to sole till
they rested on the loose loop in her girdle. Seeing that, she
rose up, and stretched her arms, and spread open the palm of
her hand, and slapped Kadza on the cheek and ear a hard
slap, so that she heard many bells; and ere she ceased to hear
them, another, so that Kadza staggered back and screamed,
and Feshnavat was moved to exclaim, “What has the girl,
thy favourite, offended in, O my daughter ?”
So, Noorna continued slapping Kadza, and cried, "Is she
not sluttish? and where 's the point of decency established
in her, this Luloo? Shall her like appear before thee and
me with loose girdle !”
Then, she pointed to the girdle, and Kadza tightened the
loose loop, and fell upon the ground to avoid the slaps, and
Noorna knelt by her, and clutched at a portion of her dress
and examined it, peering intently ; and she caught up another
part, and knotted it as if to crush a living creature, hunting
over her, and grasping at her; and so it was that while she
tore strips from the garments of Kadza, Feshnavat jumped
suddenly in wrath, and pinched over his garments, crying,
"'T is unbearable! 'T is I know not what other than a flea
that persecuteth me.”
Upon that, Noorna ran to him, and while they searched

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
together for the Flea, Baba Mustapha fidgeted and worried in
his seat, lurching to the right and to the left, muttering
curses; and it was evident he too was persecuted, and there
was no peace on the roof of that palace, but pinching and
howling and stretching of limbs, and curses snarled in the
throat and imprecations on the head of the tormenting Flea.
Surely, the soul of Kadza rejoiced, for she knew the Flea was
Karaz, whom she had brought with her in the loose loop of
her girdle through the circle of flame which was a barrier
against him. She glistened at the triumph of the Flea, but
Noorna strode to her, and took her to the side of the roof,
and pitched her down it, and closed the passage to her.
Then ran she to Karavejis and Veejravoosh, whispering in
the ear of each, “No word of the Sword ?” and afterward
aloud, “What think ye will be the term of the staying of my
betrothed in Aklis, crowned ape ? ”.
They answered, “O pearl of the morn, crowned ape till
such time as Shagpat be shaved.”
So, she beat her breast, crying, “Oh, utter stagnation, till
Shagpat be shaved ! and oh, stoppage in the tide of business,
dense cloud upon the face of beauty, and frost on the river
of events, till Shagpat be shaved! And oh! my betrothed
crowned ape in Aklis till Shagpat be shaved ! ”
Then, she lifted her hands and arms, and said, “To him
where he is, ye Genii ! and away, for he needeth comfort.”
Thereat, the glittering spirits dissolved and thinned, and
were as taper gleams of curved light across the water in
their ascent of the heavens. So, when they were gone
Noorna exclaimed, “Now for the dish of pomegranate grain,
O Baba Mustapha, and let nothing delay us further.”
Quoth Baba Mustapha, “ T is ordered, O my princess and
fair mistress, from the confectioner's; and with it the sleepy
drug from the seller of medicaments-0 accursed Flea !”
Now, she laughed, and said, “What am I, O Baba Mus-
tapha ?”
So, he said, "Not thou, O bright shooter of beams, but

THE DISH OF POMEGRANATE GRAIN. 253
I, wullahy! I 'm but a bundle of points through the perti-
nacity of this Flea ! a house of irritabilities ! a mere mass of
fretfulness ! and I've no thought but for the chasing of this
unlucky Flea: was never flea like it in the world before this
Flea ; and 't is a Flea to anger the holy ones, and make the
saintly Dervish swear at such a Flea." He wriggled and
curled where he sat, and Noorna cried, “What ! shall we be
defeated by a Flea, we that would shave Shagpat, and release
this city and the world from bondage ?” And she looked up
to the sky that was then without a cloud, blazing with the
sun on his mid seat, and exclaimed, “O star of Shagpat !
wilt thou constantly be in the ascendant, and defeat us, the
liberators of men, with a Flea ?”.
Now, whenever one of the twain, Baba Mustapha and the
Vizier Feshnavat, commenced speaking of the dish of pome-
granate grain, the torment of the Flea took all tongue from
him, and was destruction to the gravity of council and de-
liberation. Lo! the dish of pomegranate grain was brought
to them by slaves, and the drug to induce sleep, yet neither
could say aught concerning it, they were as jointy grasshoppers
through the action of the Flea, and the torment of the Flea
became a madness, they shrieking, “'T is now with thee !
'T is now with me! Fires of the damned on this Flea !”
In their extremity, they called to Allah for help, but no help
came, save when they abandoned all speech concerning the
dish of pomegranate grain, then were they for a moment eased
of the Flea. So, Noorna recognized the presence of her
enemy Karaz, and his malicious working ; and she went and
fetched a jar brimmed with water for the bath, and stirred it
with her forefinger, and drew on it a fiame from the rays of
the sun till there rose up from the jar a white thick smoke.
So, she rustled her raiment, making the wind of it collect round
Baba Mustapha and Feshnavat, and did this till the sweat
streamed from their brows and bodies, and they were sensible
of peace and the absence of the Flea. Then, she whisked away
the smoke, and they were attended by slaves with fresh robes,

and were as new men, and sat together over the dish of pome-
granate grain, praising the wisdom of Noorna and her power.
Then, Baba Mustapha revived in briskness, and cried, “Here
the dish! and 't is in my hands an instrument, an instrument
of vengeance ! and one to endow the skilful wielder of it
with glory. And it is as I designed it,-sweet, seasoned,
savoury,—a flattery to the eye and no deceiver to the palate.
Wah! and such an instrument in the hands of the discerning
and the dexterous, and the discreet and the judicious, and
them gifted with determination, is 't not such as sufficeth for
the overturning of empires and systems, O my mistress, fair
one, sapphire of this city? And is 't not written that I shall
beguile Shagpat by its means, and master the Event, and
shame the King of Oolb and his Court? And I shall then
sit in state among men, and surround myself with adornments
and with slaves, mute, that speak not save at the signal, and
are as statues round the cushions of their lord—that 's
myself. And I shall surround myself with the flatteries of
wealth, and walk bewildered in silks and stuffs and per-
fumeries ; and sweet young beauties shall I have about me,
antelopes of grace, as I like them, and select them, long-eyed,
lazy, fond of listening, and with bashful looks that timidly
admire the dignity that's in man. And 't is an instrument_”
Now, while he was prating Noorna took the dish in her lap,
and folded her silvery feet beneath her, and commenced whip-
ping into it the drug: and she whipped it dexterously and
with equal division among the grain, whipping it and the Flea
with it, but she feigned not to mark the Flea and whipped
harder. Then, took she colour and coloured it saffron, and
laid over it gold-leaf, so that it glittered and was an enticing
sight; and the dish was of gold, crusted over with devices and
patterns, and heads of golden monsters, a ravishment of skill
in him that executed it, cumbrous with ornate golden work-
manship; likewise, there were places round the dish for sticks
of perfume and cups carved for the storing of perfumed pellets,
and into these Noorna put myrrh and ambergris and rich

255
incenses, aloes, sandalwood, prepared essences, divers keen and
sweet scents. Then, when all was in readiness, she put the
dish upon the knee of Baba Mustapha, and awoke him from
his babbling reverie with a shout, and said, “An instrument
verily, 0 Baba Mustapha ! and art thou a cat to shave
Shagpat with that tongue of thine ?”
Now, he arose and made the sign of obedience and said,
“'T is well, O lady of grace and bright wit ! and now for the
cap of Shiraz and the Persian robe, and my twenty slaves
and seven to follow me to the mansion of Shagpat. I 'll do:
I'll act.”
So, she motioned to a slave to bring the cap of Shiraz and
the Persian robe, and in these Baba Mustapha arrayed him-
self. Then, called he for the twenty-and-seven slaves, and
they were ranged, some to go before, some to follow him.
And he was exalted, and made the cap of Shiraz nod in his
conceit, crying, “Am I not leader in this complot ? Wullahy!
all bow to me and acknowledge it." Then, to check himself
he called out sternly to the slaves, “Ho ye ! forward to the
mansion of Shagpat; and pass at a slow pace through the
streets of the city-solemnly, gravely, as before a potentate ;
then will the people inquire of ye, Who 't is ye marshal, and
what mighty one ? and ye will answer, He's from the court of
Shiraz,—nothing less than a Vizier.— bearing homage to
Shagpat, even this dish of pomegranate grain.”
So, they said, “To hear is to obey."
Upon that, he waved his hand and stalked majestically, and
they descended from the roof into the street, criers running
in front to clear the way. So, when Baba Mustapha was
hidden from view by a corner of the street, Noorna shrank in
her white shoulders and laughed, and was like a flashing pearl
as she swayed and dimpled with laughter. And she cried,
“True are those words of the poet, and I testify to them in
the instance of Baba Mustapha :
With feathers of the cock, I'll fashion a vain creature;
With feathers of the ow), I'll make a judge in feature;'

Is not the barber elate and lofty? He goeth forth to the
mastery of this Event as go many, armed with nought other
than their own conceit: and 't is written:
"Fools from their fate seek not to urge :
The coxcomb carrieth his scourge.'”.
So Feshnavat smoothed his face, and said, “Is 't not also
written l--
"Oft may the fall of fools make wise men moan!
Too often the house hangeth on one loose stone !'
'Tis so, O Noorna, my daughter, and I am as a reed shaken
by the wind of apprehensiveness, and doubt in me is a deep
root as to the issue of this undertaking, for the wrath of the
King will be terrible, and the clamour of the people soundeth
in my ears already. If Shibli Bagarag fail in one stroke,
where be we? 'T is certain I knew not the might in Shagpat
when I strove with him, and he's powerful beyond the measure
of man's subtlety; and yonder flies a rook without fellow-
an omen ; and all’s ominous, and ominous of ill: and I marked
among the troop of slaves that preceded Baba Mustapha one
that squinted, and that 's an omen ; and, O my daughter, I
counsel that thou by thy magic speed us to some remote
point in the Caucasus, where we may abide the unravelling
of this web securely, one way or the other way. 'T is my
counsel, 0 Noorna.”
Then she, “Abandon my betrothed? and betray him on the
very stroke of the Sword ? and diminish him by a withdrawal
of that faith in his right wrist which strengtheneth it more than
Karavejis and Veejravoosh wound round it in coils ?” And
she leaned her head, and cried, “Hark! hear'st thou? there's
shouting in the streets of Shiraz and of Shagpat! Shall we
merit the punishment of Shahpesh the Persian on Khipil the
builder, while the Event's mastering? I'll mark this inter-
view between Baba Mustapha and Shagpat; and do thou, O
my father, rest here on this roof till the King's guard of

horsemen and soldiers of the law come hither for thee, and
go with them sedately, fearing nought, for I shall be by thee
in the garb of an old woman; and preserve thy composure
in the presence of the King and Shagpat exalted, and allow
not the thing that happeneth let fly from thee the shaft of
speech, but remain a slackened bow till the strength of my
betrothed is testified, fearing nought, for fear is that which
defeateth men, and 'tis declared in a distich,-
The strongest weapon one can see
In mortal hands is Constancy.'
And for us to flee now would rank us with that King
described by the poet:
“A king of Ind there was who fought a fight
From the first gleam of morn till fall of night;
But when the royal tent his generals sought,
Proclaiming victory, fled was he who fought.
Despair possessed them, till they chanced to spy
A Dervish that paced on with downward eye;
They questioned of the King; he answer'd slow,
“ Ye fought but one, the King a double, foe.",
And, O my father, they interpreted of this that the King had
been vanquished, he that was victor, by the phantom army of
his fears."
Now, the Vizier cried, “Be the will of Allah achieved and
consummated !” and he was silenced by her wisdom and
urgency, and sat where he was, diverting not the arch on his
brow from its settled furrow. He was as one that thirsteth,
and whose eye hath marked a snake of swift poison by the
water, so thirsted he for the Event, yet hung with dread from
advancing ; but Noorna bin Noorka busied herself about the
roof, drawing circles to witness the track of an enemy, and
she clapped her hands and cried, “Luloo !” and lo, a fair
slave-girl that came to her and stood by with bent head, like
a white lily by a milk-white antelope ; so, Noorna clouded
her brow a moment, as when the moon darkeneth behind a

scud, and cried, “Speak! art thou in league with Karaz,
girl ?”
Luloo strained her hands to her temples, exclaiming, “With
the terrible Genie?—I?—in league with him? O my mistress,
surely the charms I wear, and the amulets, I wear them as a
protection from that Genie and a safeguard, he that carrieth
off the maidens and the young sucklings, walking under the
curse of mothers.”
Said Noorna, “0 Luloo, have I boxed those little ears of
thine this day?”
The fair slave-girl smiled a smile of submissive tenderness,
and answered, “Not this day, nor once since Luloo was rescued
from the wicked old merchant by thy overbidding, and was
taken to the arms of a wise, kind sister, wiser and kinder than
any she had been stolen from, she that is thy slave for ever.”
She said this weeping, and Noorna mused, “'T was as I
divined, that wretched Kadza : “her grief's to come!” Then,
spake she aloud as to herself, “Knew I, or could one know, I
should this day be a bride ?” And, hearing that, Luldo
shrieked, “ Thou a bride, and torn from me, and we two
parted ? and I, a poor drooping tendril, left to wither? for my
life is round thee and worthless away from thee, O cherisher
of the fallen flower."
And she sobbed out wailful verses and words, broken and
without a meaning; but Noorna caught her by the arm and
swung her, and bade her fetch on the instant a robe of blue,
and pile in her chamber robes of amber and saffron and grey,
bridal-robes of many-lighted silks, plum-coloured, peach-
coloured, of the colour of musk mixed with pale gold, together
with bridal ornaments and veils of the bride, and a jewelled
circlet for the brow. When this was done, Noorna went with
Luloo to her chamber, attended by slave-girls, and arrayed
herself in the first dress of blue, and swayed herself before the
mirror, and rattled the gold pieces in her hair and on her neck
with laughter. And Luloo was bewildered, and forgot her
tears to watch the gaiety of her mistress; and lo! Noorna

made her women take off one set of ornaments with every
dress, and with every dress she put on another set; and after
she had gone the round of the different dresses, she went to
the bath-room with Luloo, and at her bidding Luloo entered
the bath beside Noorna, and the twain dipped and shouldered
in the blue water, and were as when a single star is by
the full moon on a bright midnight pouring lustre about.
And Noorna splashed Luloo, and said, “This night we shall
not sleep together, 0 Luloo, nor lie close, thy bosom on
mine.”
Thereat, Luloo wept afresh, and cried, “Ah, cruel! and 't is
a sweet thought for thee, and thou ’lt have no mind for me,
tossing on my hateful lonely couch.”
Tenderly Noorna eyed Luloo, and the sprinkles of the bath
fell with the tears of both, and they clung together, and were
like the lily and its bud on one stalk in a shower. Then,
when Noorna had spent her affection, she said, “O thou of the
long downward lashes, thy love was constant when I stood
under a curse and was an old woman—a hag! Carest thou
so little to learn the name of him that claimeth me?"
Luloo replied, “I thought of no one save myself and my
loss, O my lost pearl ; happy is he, a youth of favour. Oh,
how I shall hate him that taketh thee from me. Tell me
now his name, O sovereign of hearts !”
So, Noorna smoothed the curves and corners of her mouth
and calmed her countenance, crying in a deep tone and a
voice as of reverence, “Shagpat !”
Now, at that name Luloo drank in her breath and was awed,
and sank in herself, and had just words to ask, “Hath he
demanded thee again in marriage, O my mistress ?”
Said Noorna, “Even so."
Luloo muttered, “Great is the Dispenser of our fates!”
And she spake no further, but sighed and took napkins
and summoned the slave-girls, and arrayed Noorna silently
in the robe of blue and bridal ornaments. Then, Noorna
said to them that thronged about her, “Put on, each of ye

a robe of white, ye that are maidens, and a fillet of blue, and
a sash of saffron, and abide my coming."
And she said to Luloo, “ Array thyself in a robe of blue,
even as mine, and let trinkets lurk in thy tresses, and abide
my coming."
Then went she forth from them, and veiled her head
and swathed her figure in raiment of a coarse white stuff, and
was as the moon going behind a hill of dusky snow, and left
the house, and passed along the streets and by the palaces,
till she came to the palace of her father, now filled by Shag-
pat. Before the palace grouped a great concourse and a
multitude of all ages and either sex in that city, despite the
blaze and the heat. Like roaring of a sea beyond the moun-
tains was the noise that issued from them, and their eyes
were a fire of beams against the portal of the palace. Now,
she saw in the crowd one Shafrac, a shoemaker, and ad-
dressed him, saying, “O Shafrac, the shoemaker, what is
this assembly, and how got together? for the poet says :
"Ye string not such assemblies in the street,
Save when some high Event should be complete.'»
He answered, “ 'T is an event complete. Wullahy! the
deputation from Shiraz to Shagpat, and the submission of
that vain city to the might of Shagpat.” And he asked her,
jestingly, “ Art thou a witch, to guess that, О veiled and
virtuous one ?”
Quoth she, “I read the thing that cometh ere 't is come,
and I read danger to Shagpat in this deputation from Shiraz,
and this dish of pomegranate grain.”
So, Shafrac cried, “By the beard of my fathers and that
of Shagpat! let's speak of this to Zeel, the garlic-seller.” .
He broadened to one that was by him, and said, “O
Zeel, what's thy mind? Here 's a woman, a wise woman, a
witch, and she sees danger to Shagpat in this deputation from
Shiraz and this dish of pomegranate grain.”
Now, Zeel screwed his visage and gazed up into his fore-

head, and said, “'T were best to consult with Bootlbac, the
drum-beater.”
The two then called to Bootlbac, the drum-beater, and told
him the matter, and Bootlbac pondered, and tapped his brow
and beat on his stomach, and said, “ Krooz el Krazawik, the
carrier, is good in such a case.”
Now, from Krooz el Krazawik, the carrier, they went to
Dob, the confectioner; and from Dõb, the confectioner, to
Azawool, the builder; and from Azawool, the builder, to
Tcheik, the collector of taxes; and each referred to some
other, till perplexity triumphed and was a cloud over them,
and the words, “Danger to Shagpat," went about like bees,
and were canvassing, when suddenly a shrill voice rose from
the midst, dominating other voices, and it was that of Kadza,
and she cried, “Who talks here of danger to Shagpat, and
what wretch is it?”
Now, Tcheik pointed out Azawool, and Azawool Dõb, and
Dob Krooz el Krazawik, and he Bootlbac, and the drum-
beater shrugged his shoulder at Zeel, and Zeel stood away
from Shafrac, and Shafrac seized Noorna and shouted, “'T is
she, this woman, the witch !”
So, Kadza fronted Noorna, and called to her, “O thing of
infamy, what's this talk of thine concerning danger to our
glory, Shagpat?”
Then, Noorna replied, “I say it, O Kadza! and I say it;
there is danger threateneth him, and from that deputation
and that dish of pomegranate grain."
Now, Kadza laughed a loose laugh, and jeered at Noorna,
crying, “Danger to Shagpat ! he that 's attended by Genii,
and watched over by the greatest of them, day and night
incessantly ? "
And Noorna said, “I ask pardon of the Power that seeth,
and of thee, if I be wrong. Wah! am I not also of them
that watch over Shagpat? So then let thou and I go into
the palace and examine the doings of this deputation and
this dish of pomegranate grain.”

262
THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Now, Kadza remembered the scene on the roofs of the Vizier
Feshnavat, and relaxed in her look of suspicion, and said,
“'T is well! Let's in to them.”
Thereupon, the twain threaded through the crowd and
knocked at the portals of the palace, and it was opened to
them and they entered, and lo! the hand that opened the
portals was the hand of a slave of the Sword, and against
corners of the Court leaned slaves silly with slumber. So,
Kadza went up to them, and beat them, and shook them, and
they yawned and mumbled, “Excellent grain ! good grain !
the grain of Shiraz!” And she beat them with what might
was hers, till some fell sideways and some forward, still
mumbling, “Excellent pomegranate grain !” Kadza was
beside herself with anger and vexation at them, tearing them
and cuffing them; but Noorna cried, “O Kadza! what said
I ? there 's danger to Shagpat in this dish of pomegranate
grain ! and what 's that saying:
"T is much against the Master's wish
That slaves too greatly praise his dish.'
Wullahy! I like not this talk of the grain of Shiraz."
Now, while Noorna spake the eyes of Kadza became like
those of the starved wild-cat, and she sprang off and along
the marble of the Court, and clawed a passage through the air
and past the marble pillars of the palace toward the first
room of reception, Noorna following her. And in the first
room were slaves leaning and lolling like them about the
Court, and in the second room and in the third room, silent
all of them, and senseless. So, at this sight the spark of
suspicion became a mighty flame in the bosom of Kadza, and
horror burst out at all ends of her, and she shuddered, and
cried, “What for us, and where 's our hope if Shagpat be
shorn, and he lopped of the Identical, shamed like the lion
of my dream !”
And Noorna clasped her hands, and said, “'T is that I
fear! Seek for him, O Kadza !”

THE DISH OF POMEGRANATE GRAIN.

So, Kadza ran to a window and looked forth over the
garden of the palace, and it was a fair garden with the gleam
of a fountain and watered plants and cool arches of shade,
thick bowers, fragrant alleys, long sheltered terraces, and
beyond the garden a summer-house of marble fanned by the
broad leaves of a palm. Now, when Kadza had gazed a
moment, she shrieked, “He's there! Shagpat! giveth he not
the light of a jewel to the house that holdeth him? Awahy!
and he is witched there for an ill purpose.”
Then, tore she from that room like a mad thing after its
stolen cubs, and sped along corridors of the palace, and down
the great flight of steps into the garden and across the garden,
knocking over the ablution-pots in her haste; and Noorna
had just strength to withhold her from dashing through the
doors of the summer-house to come upon Shagpat, she strain-
ing and crying, “He's there, I say, O wise woman! Shagpat!
let's in to him.”
But Noorna clung to her, and spake in her ear, “ Wilt
thou blow the fire that menaces him, O Kadza ? and what
are two women against the assailants of such a mighty one
as he ?” Then said she, “Watch, rather, and avail thyself
of yonder window by the blue-painted pillar.”
So, Kadza crept up to the blue-painted pillar which was on
the right side of the porch, and the twain peered through the
window. Noorna beheld the Dish of Pomegranate Grain ;
and it was on the floor, empty of the grain, and Baba Mustapha
was by it alone making a lather, and he was twitching his
mouth and his legs, and flinging about his arms, and Noorna
heard him mutter wrathfully, “O accursed Flea ! art thou at
me again ?” And she heard him mutter as in anguish, “No
peace for thee, O pertinacious Flea ! and my steadiness of
hand will be gone, now when I have him safe as the hawk
his prey, mine enemy, this Shagpat that abused me: thou
abominable Flea! And, O thou Flea, wilt thou, vile thing !
hinder me from mastering the Event, and releasing this
people and the world from enchantment and bondage ? And

shall I fail to become famous to the ages and the times
because of such as thee, O Flea ?”
So, Kadza whispered to Noorna, “What 's that he 's
muttering? Is 't of Shagpat? for I mark him not here, nor
the light by which he 's girt.”
She answered, “ Listen with the ear and the eye and all
the senses."
Now, presently they heard Baba Mustapha say in a louder
tone, like one that is secure from interruption, “Two lathers,
and this is the third ! a potent lather! and I wot there's not
a hair in this world resisteth the sweep of my blade over such
a lather as—Ah ! Flea of iniquity and abomination ! what !
am I doomed to thy torments !--so let's spread ! Lo! this
lather, is 't not the pride of Shiraz ? and the polish and
smoothness it sheddeth, is 't not roseate ? my invention ! as
the poet says,-0 accursed Flea ! now the knee-joint, now the
knee-cap, and 't is but a hop for thee to the arm-pit. Fires of
the pit without bottom seize thee !—now the knee again! now
the neck, the nape of it !-So, then—where was I ? Con-
templating the lather ? and a fair lather is it, invented by
me, and no more words concerning it or aught else, but set
thyself to the task, O Baba Mustapha of happy birth! and
– Achrrrr, Flea, Flea, Flea ! is no place sacred from thee,
and art thou a restless soul, infernal Flea & Wah! I'll be
turned aside by nought living, nay, nor dead; for here 's
Shagpat, the very centre of the sun of radiance, mine enemy
and the enemy of man, beneath my thumb, dumb beneath it,
and as a frozen frog and slumbering porcupine ; and he is
behind two clouds, and this third will be a quenching of his
beams, and a transferring them to me that I may shame Oolb,
and its King and its Court, and its—Flea of infamy ! curses
light on thee ! and thou 'rt of a surety acting under the
instigation of the Evil One, and Satan 's in thee! Begone,
and release me! So then, peace awhile, and here 's for the
third lather."
Now while he was speaking Baba Mustapha advanced to a

265
large white object that sat motionless, upright like a snow-
mound on a throne of cushions, and commenced lathering.
When she saw that, Kadza tossed up her head and her
throat, and a shriek was coming from her, for she was ware
of Shagpat; but Noorna stifled the shriek, and clutched her
fast, whispering, “He's safe if thou have but patience, thou
silly Kadza! and the Flea will defeat this fellow if thou
spoil it not.”
So, Kadza said, looking up, “Is 't seen of Allah, and be
the Genii still in their depths ?” but she constrained herself,
peering and perking out her chin, and lifting one foot and
the other foot, as on furnaces of fire in the excess of the fury
she smothered. And lo, Baba Mustapha worked diligently,
and Shagpat was behind an exulting lather, even as one pelted
with wheaten flour-balls or balls of powdery perfume, and his
hairiness was as branches of the forest foliage bent under a
sudden fall of overwhelming snow that filleth the pits and
sharpeneth the wolves with hunger, and teacheth new cunning
to the fox. A fox was Baba Mustapha in his stratagems,
and a wolf in the fierceness of his setting upon Shagpat.
Surely, he drew forth the blade that was to shear Shagpat,
and made with it in the air a preparatory sweep and flourish;
and the blade frolicked and sent forth a light, and seemed
eager for Shagpat. So, Baba Mustapha addressed his arm to
the shearing, and inclined gently the edge of the blade, and
they marked him let it slide twice to a level with the head
of Shagpat, and the third time it touched, and Kadza howled,
but from Baba Mustapha there burst a howl to madden the
beasts; and he flung up his blade, and wrenched open his
robe, crying, “A Flea was it to bite in that fashion ? Now,
I swear by the Merciful, a fang like that's common to tigers
and hyænas and ferocious animals.”
Then looked he for the mark of the bite, plaining of its
pang, and he could find the mark nowhere. So, as he caressed
himself, eyeing Shagpat sheepishly and with gathering awe,
Noorna said, hurriedly, to Kadza, “Away now, and call them

in, the crowd about the palace, that they may behold the
triumph of Shagpat, for ’t is ripe, O Kadza !”
And Kadza replied, “ Thou ’rt a wise woman, and I'll have
thee richly rewarded. Lo, I ’m as a camel lightened of fifty
loads, and the glory of Shagpat see I as a new sun rising in
the desert. Wullahy! thou 'rt wise, and I'll do thy bidding."
Now, she went flying back to the palace, and called shrill
calls to the crowd, and collected them in the palace, and
headed them through the garden, and it was when Baba Mus-
tapha had summoned courage for a second essay, and was in
the act of standing over Shagpat to operate on him, that the
crowd burst the doors, and he was quickly seized by them, and
tugged at and hauled at and pummelled, and torn and vitupe-
rated, and as a wrecked vessel on stormy waters, plunging up
and down with tattered sails, when the crew fling overboard
freight and ballast and provision. Surely, his time would have
been short with that mob, but Noorna made Kadza see the use
of examining him before the King, and there were in that
mob Sheikhs and Fakirs, holy men who listened to the words of
Kadza, and exerted themselves to rescue Baba Mustapha, and
quieted the rage that was prevailing, and bore Baba Mustapha
with them to the great palace of the King, which was in the
centre of that City. Now, when the King heard of the
attempt on Shagpat, and the affair of the Pomegranate Grain,
he gave orders for the admission of the people, as many of
them as could be contained in the Hall of Justice : and he set
a guard over Baba Mustapha, and commanded that Shagpat
should be brought to the palace even as he then was, and with
the lather on him. So, the regal mandate went forth, and
Shagpat was brought in state on cushions, and the potency of
the drug preserved his sedateness through all this, and he
remained motionless in sleep, folded in the centre of calm
and satisfaction, while this tumult was raging and the City
shook with uproar. But the people, when they saw him
whitened behind a treble lather, wrath at Baba Mustapha's
polluting touch and the audacity of barbercraft wrestled in

them with the outpouring of reverence for Shagpat, and a
clamour arose for the instant sacrifice of Baba Mustapha at
the foot of their idol Shagpat. And the whole of the City
of Shagpat, men, women, and children, and the sheikhs and
the dervishes and crafts of the City besieged the King's palace
in that middle hour of the noon, clamouring for the sacrifice
of Baba Mustapha at the feet of their idol Shagpat.

THE BURNING OF THE IDENTICAL.
Now, the Great Hall for the dispensing of justice in the palace
of the King was one on which the architect and the artificers
had lavished all their arts and subtleties of design and taste
and their conceptions of uniformity and grandeur, so that none
entered it without a sense of abasement, and the soul acknow-
ledged awfulness and power in him that ruled and sat eminent
on the throne of that Hall. For, lo! the throne was of solid
weighty gold, overhung with rich silks and purples; and the
hall was lofty, with massive pillars, fifty on either side, ranging
in stateliness down toward the blaze of the throne; and the
pillars were pillars of porphyry and of jasper and precious
marble, carven over all of them with sentences of the cun-
ningest wisdom, distichs of excellence, odes of the poet, stanzas
sharp with the incisiveness of wit, and that solve knotty
points with but one stroke; and these pillars were each the
gift of a mighty potentate of earth, or of a Genie.
In the centre of the hall a fountain sent up a glittering jet,
and spread abroad the breath of freshness, leaping a height of
sixty feet, and shimmering there in a wide bright canopy with
dropping silver sides. It was rumoured of the waters of this
fountain that they were fed underground from the waters of
the Sacred River, brought there in the reign of El Rasoon, a
former sovereign in the City of Shagpat, by the labours of
Zâk,—a Genie subject to the magic of Azrooka, the Queen of
El Rasoon; but, of a surety, none of earth were like to them in

silveriness, sweet coolingness, and they were as wine to the
weary.
Now, the King sat on his throne in the hall, and around
him his ministers, and Emirs, and chamberlains, and officers
of state, and black slaves, and the soldiers of his guard armed
with naked scimitars. And the King was as a sun in splen-
dour, severely grave, and a frown on his forehead to darken
kingdoms, for the attempt on Shagpat had stirred his kingly
wrath, and awakened zeal for the punishment of all con-
spirators and offenders. So, when Shagpat was borne in to
the King upon his throne of cushions where he sat upright,
smiling and inanimate, the King commanded that he should
be placed at his side, the place of honour; and Shagpat was
as a moon behind the whiteness of the lathers; even as we
behold moon and sun together in the heavens, was Shagpat
by the King.
There was great hubbub in the hall at the entrance of
Shagpat, and a hum of rage and muttered vehemence passed
among the assembled people that filled the hall like a cavern
of the sea, the sea roaring outside ; but presently the King
spake, and all hushed. Then, said he, “O people ! thought I
to see a day that would lather Shagpat? he that has brought
honour and renown upon me and all of this city, so that
we shine a constellation and place of pilgrimage to men
in remote islands and corners of the earth ? Yea! and to
Afrites and Genii? Have I not castigated barbers, and
brought barbercraft to degradation and shame, so that no
youth is taught to exercise it? And through me the tackle
of the barber, is 't not a rusty and abominated weapon, and
as a sword thrown by and broken, for that it dishonoured us?
Surely, too, I have esteemed Shagpat precious.”
While he spake the King gazed on Shagpat, and was
checked by passion at beholding him under the lathers, so that
the people praised Shagpat and the King. Then said he, “O
people, who shall forecast disasters and triumphs ? Lo, I had
this day at dawn intelligence from recreant Oolb, and its

King and Court, and of their entire return to hairiness and
Shagpat! And I had this day at dawn tidings, 0 people,
from Shiraz, and of the adhesion of that vain city and its
provinces to hairiness and the might of Shagpat! So com-
menced the day, yet is he, the object of the world's adoring,
within a few hours defiled by lathers and the hand of an
impious one ! ”
At these words of the King there rose a shout of vindictive-
ness and fury; but he cried, “ Punishment on the offenders
in season, 0 people! Probably we have not abased our-
selves for the honour that has befallen us in Shagpat, and
the distinction among nations and tribes and races, and creeds
and sects, that we enjoy because of Shagpat. Behold ! in
abasement voluntarily undertaken there is exceeding bright-
ness and exaltation ; for how is the sun a sun save that
daily he dippeth in darkness, to rise again freshly majestic ?
So then, be mine the example, 0 people of the City of
Shagpat!”
Thereupon, lo, the King descended from his throne, and
stripped to the loins, flinging away his glittering crown and
his robes, and abased himself to the dust with loud cries
and importunities and howls, and penitential ejaculations
and sobbings; and it was in that Hall as when the sun goeth
down in storm. Likewise the ministers of the King, and
the Viziers and Emirs and officers of state, and slaves, and
soldiers of the guard, bared their limbs, and fell beside the
King with violent outcries and wailings; and the whole of
the people in the Hall prostrated their bodies with wailings
and lamentations. And Baba Mustapha feigned to bewail
himself, and Noorna bin Noorka knelt beside Kadza, and
shrieked loudest, striking her breast and scattering her hair ;
and that Hall was as a pit full of serpents writhing, and of
tigers and lions and wild beasts howling, each pitching his
howl a note above his neighbours, so that the tone rose and
sank, and there was no one soul erect in that Hall save
Shagpat, he on his throne of cushions smiling behind the

271
lathers, inanimate, serene as they that sin not. After an
hour's lapse there came a pause, and the people hearkened
for the voice of the King; but in the intervals a louder
moan would strike their ears, and they whispered among
themselves, “'T is that of the Fakir, El Zoop!” and the
moaning and howling prevailed again. And again they
heard another moan, a deep one, as of the earth in its throes,
and said among themselves, “T is that of Bootlbac, the
drum-beater !” and this led off to the howl of Areep, the
dervish ; and this was followed by the shriek of Zeel, the
garlic-seller; and the waul of Krooz el Kraza wik, the carrier ;
and the complainings of Dob, the confectioner; and the
groan of Sallập, the broker; and the yell of Azawool, the
builder. There would have been no end to it known; but
the King rose and commenced plucking his beard and his
hair,—they likewise in silence. When he had performed
this ceremony a space, the King called, and a basin of water
was brought to him, and handed round by slaves, and all
dipped in it their hands, and renewed their countenances and
re-arranged their limbs; and the Hall brightened with the
eye of the King, and he cried, “O people, lo, the plot is re-
vealed to me, and ’t is a deep one ; but, by this beard, we 'll
strike at the root of it, and a blow of deadliness. Surely we
have humiliated ourselves, and vengeance is ours ! How
say ye ?"
A noise like the first sullen growl of a vexed wild beast
which telleth that fury is fast travelling and the teeth will
flash, followed these words; and the King called to his
soldiers of the guard, “Ho! forth with this wretch that
dared defile Shagpat, the holy one ! and on your heads be it
to fetch hither Feshnavat, the son of Feil, that was my
Vizier, he that was envious of Shagpat, and whom we spared
in our clemency."
Some of the guard went from the Hall to fulfil the King's
injunction on Feshnavat, others thrust forth Baba Mustapha
in the eyes of the King. Baba Mustapha was quaking as a

frog quaketh for water, and he trembled and was a tongueless
creature deserted of his lower limbs, and with eyeballs gog-
gling, through exceeding terror. Now, when the King saw
him, he contracted his brows as one that peereth on a small
and minute object, crying, “How! is 't such as he, this
monster of audaciousness and horrible presumption ? Truly
't is said :
For ruin and the deeds preluding change,
Fear not great Beasts, nor Eagles when they range :
But dread the crawling worm or pismire mean,
Satan selects them, and they are unseen.'
And this wretch is even of that sort, the select of Satan !
Off with the top of the reptile, and away with him!”
Now, at the issue of the mandate Baba Mustapha choked,
and horror blocked the throat of confession in him, so that
he did nought save stagger imploringly ; but the prompting
of Noorna sent Kadza to the foot of the throne, and Kadza
bent her body and exclaimed, “O King of the age ! 't is
Kadza, the espoused of Shagpat thy servant, that speaketh;
and lo! a wise woman has said in my ear, 'How if this
emissary and instrument of the Evil One, this barber, this
filthy fellow, be made to essay on Shagpat before the people
his science and his malice ? for 't is certain that Shagpat is
surrounded where he sitteth by Genii invisible, defended by
them, and no harm can hap to him, but an illumination of
glory and triumph manifest:' and for this barber, his punish-
ment can afterwards be looked to, O great King !”
The King mused awhile and sank in his beard. Then said
he to them that had hold of Baba Mustapha watching for
the signal, “I've thought over it, and the means of bringing
double honour on the head of Shagpat. So, release this
fellow, and put in his hands the tackle taken from him."
This was done, and the people applauded the wisdom of
the King, and crowded forward with sharpness of expecta-
tion; but Baba Mustapha, when he felt in his hands the

tackle, the familiar instruments, strength and wit returned to
him in petty measures, and he thought, “Perchance there 'll
yet be time for my nephew to strike if he fail me not; fool
that I was to look for glory, and not leave the work to him,
for this Shagpat is a mighty one, powerful in Fleas, and it
needeth something other than tackle to combat such as he.
A mighty one, said I? by Allah, he's awful in his mighti-
ness !” So, Baba Mustapha kept delaying, and feigned to
sharpen the blade, and the King called to him, “ Haste ! to
the work ! is it for thee, vile wretch, to make preparation for
the accursed thing in our presence ?” And the people mur-
mured and waxed impatient, and the King called again,
“Thou 'lt essay this, thou wretch, without a head, let but
another minute pass.” So, when Baba Mustapha could delay
no longer, he sighed heavily and his trembling returned, and
the power of Shagpat smote him with an invisible hand so
that he could scarce move; but dread pricked him against
dread, and he advanced upon Shagpat to shear him, and
assumed the briskness of the barber, and was in the act of
bending over him to bring the blade into play, when, behold,
one of the chamberlains of the King stood up in the presence
and spake a word that troubled him, and the King rose and
hurried to a balcony looking forth on the Desert, and on
three sides of the Desert three separate clouds of dust were
visible, and from these clouds presently emerged horsemen
with spears and pennons and plumes; and he could discern
the flashing of their helms and the glistening of steel-plates
and armour of gold and silver. Seeing this, the colour went
from the cheeks of the King and his face became as a pinched
pomegranate, and he cried aloud, “What visitation 's this?
Awahy! we are beset, and here 's abasement brought on us
without self-abasing !” Meantime these horsemen detached
themselves from the main bodies and advanced at a gallop,
wheeling and circling around each other, toward the
walls of the city, and when they were closed they lowered
their arms and made signs of amity, and proclaimed their

mission and the name of him they served. So, tidings were
brought to the King that the Lords of three cities, with vast
retinues, were come, by reason of a warning, to pay homage
to Shagpat, the son of Shimpoor; and these three cities were
the cities of Oolb, and of Gâf, and of Shiraz, even these !
Now, when the King heard of it, he rejoiced with an ex-
ceeding great joy, and arrayed himself in glory, and mounted
a charger, the pride of his stables, and rode out to meet the
Lords of the three cities surrounded by the horsemen of his
guard. And it was within half-a-mile of the city walls that
the four, sovereigns met, and dismounted and saluted and
embraced, and bestowed on one another kingly flatteries, and
the titles of Cousin and Brother. So when the unctions of
Royalty were over, these three Kings rode back to the city
with the King that was their host, and the horsemen of the
three kingdoms pitched their tents and camped outside the
walls, making cheer. Then the King of the City of Shagpat.
related to the three Kings the story of Shagpat and the
attempt that had been made on him; and in the great Hall
of Justice he ordained the erecting of thrones for them
whereon to sit; and they, when they had paid homage to
Shagpat, sat by him there on either side. Then the King
cried, “ This likewise owe we to Shagpat, our glory! See,
now, how the might that is in him shall defeat the machi-
nations of evil, O my cousins of Oolb, and of Gâf, and of
Shiraz.” Thereupon he called, “Bring forth the barber !"
So, Baba Mustapha was thrust forth by the soldiers of the
guard ; and the King of Shiraz, who was no other than the
great King Shahpushân, exclaimed, when he beheld Baba
Mustapha, “He? why it is the prince of barbers and talkative
ones ! Hath he not operated on my head, the head of me in
old time? Truly now, if it be in man to shave Shagpat, the
hand of this barber will do it !”
And the King of Oolb peered on Baba Mustapha, crying,
“Even this fellow I bastinadoed!”
And the King of Gâf, that was Kresnuk, famous in the

annals of the time, said aloud, " I'm amazed at the pertinacity
of this barber! To my court he came, searching some silly
nephew, and would have shaved us all in spite of our noses;
yea, talked my chief vizier into a dead sleep, and so thinned
him. And there was no safety from him save in thongs and
stripes and lashes !"
Now, upon that the King of the City cried, “Be the will
of Allah achieved, and the inviolacy of Shagpat made mani-
fest! Thou barber, thou ! do thy worst to contaminate him,
and take the punishment in store for thee. And if it is
written thou succeed, then keep thy filthy life: small chance
of that!”
So, Baba Mustapha remembered the poet's words :
The abyss is worth a leap, however wide,
When life, sweet life, is on the other side.
And he controlled himself to the mastery of his members,
and stepped forward to essay once more the Shaving of
Shagpat. Lo, the Great Hall was breathless, nought heard
save the splashing of the fountain in its fall, and the rustle
of the robe of Baba Mustapha as he aired his right arm,
hovering round Shagpat like a bird about the nest; and he
was buzzing as a bee ere it entereth the flower, and quivered
like a butterfly when 't is fluttering over a blossom ; and
Baba Mustapha sniffed at Shagpat within arm's reach, fearing
him, so that the people began to hum with a great rapture,
· and the King Shahpushân cried, “Aha! mark him ! this
monkey knoweth the fire !"
But the King of the City of Shagpat was wroth, and com-
manded his guards to flourish their scimitars, and the keen
light cut the chords of indecision in Baba Mustapha, and
drove him upon Shagpat with a dash of desperation; and lo!
he stretched his hand and brought down the blade upon
the head of Shagpat. Then was the might of Shagpat made
manifest, for suddenly in his head the Identical rose up
straight, even to a level with the roof of that hall, burning as
1 2

it had been an angry flame of many fiery colours, and Baba
Mustapha was hurled from him a great space like a ball that
reboundeth, and he was twisting after the fashion of en-
venomed serpents, sprawling and spuming, and uttering cries
of horror. Surely, to see that sight the four Kings and the
people bit their forefingers, and winked till the water stood
in their eyes, and Kadza, turning about, exclaimed, “This
owe we to the wise woman! where lurketh she?” So, she
called about the hall, “Wise woman ! wise woman !”.
Now, when she could find Noorna bin Noorka nowhere
in that crowd, she shrieked exultingly, “'T was a Genie !
Wullahy! all Afrites, male and female, are in the service of
Shagpat, my light, my eyes, my sun! I his moon!”
Meantime, the King of the City called to Baba Mustapha,
“Hast thou had enough of barbering, O vile one? Ho! a
second essay on the head of Shagpat! so shall the might
that's in him be indisputable, bruited abroad, and a great load
upon the four winds."
Now, Baba Mustapha was persuaded by the scimitars of
the guard to a second essay on the head of Shagpat, and the
second time he was shot away from Shagpat through the
crowd and great assemblage to the extreme end of the hall,
where he lay writhing about, abandoned in loathliness; and
he in his despondency, and despite of protestation and the
slackness of his limbs, was pricked again by the scimitars of
the guard to a third essay on the head of Shagpat, the people
jeering at him, for they were joyous, light of heart; and lo!
the third time he was shot off violently, and whirled away
like a stone from a sling, even into the outer air and beyond
the city walls, into the distance of waste places. And now a
great cry rose from the people, as it were a song of triumph,
for the Identical stood up wrathfully from the head of Shagpat,
burning in brilliance, blinding to look on, he sitting inanimate
beneath it; and it waxed in size and pierced through the roof
of the hall, and was a sight to the streets of the city; and the
horsemen camped without the walls beheld it, and marvelled,

THE BURNING OF THE IDENTICAL. 277
and it was as a pillar of fire to the solitudes of the Desert
afar, and the wild Arab and wandering Bedouins and caravans
of pilgrimage. Distant cities asked the reason of that appear-
ance, and the cunning Fakir interpreted it, and the fervent
Dervish expounded from it, and messengers flew from gate to
gate and from land to land in exultation, and barbers hid
their heads and were friendly with the fox in his earth,
because of that light. So the Identical burned on the head
of Shagpat as in wrath, and with exceeding splendour of
attraction, three nights and three days; and the fishes of the
sea shoaled to the sea's surface and stared at it, and the fowls
of the air congregated about the fury of the light with screams
and mad flutters, till the streets and mosques and minarets
and bright domes and roofs and cupolas of the City of
Shagpat were blackened with scorched feathers of the vulture
and the eagle and the rook and the raven and the hawk, and
other birds, sacred and obscene; so was the triumph of
hairiness made manifest to men and the end of the world by
the burning of the Identical three days and three nights.

THE FLASHES OF THE BLADE.
Now, it was the morning of the fourth day, and lo! at the
first leap of the sun of that day the flame of the Identical
abated in its fierceness, and it dwindled and darkened, and
tapered and flickered feebly, descending from its altitude in
the heavens and through the ceiling of the hall, and lay down
to sleep among the intricate lengths and frizzled convolutions
and undulating weights flowing from Shagpat, an undis-
tinguished hair, even as the common hairs of his head. So,
upon that, the four fasting Kings breathed, and from the
people of the City there went up a mighty shout of gladness
and congratulation at the glory they had witnessed; and they
took the air deeply into their chests, and were as divers that
have been long fathoms-deep under water, and ascend and
puff hard and press the water from their eyes, that yet refuse
to acknowledge with a recognition the things that be and
the sights above, so mazed are they with those unmentionable
marvels and treasures and profusion of jewels, and splendid
lazy growths and lavish filmy illuminations, and multitudinous
pearls and sheening shells, that lie heaped in the beds of the
ocean. As the poet has said :
After too strong a beam,
Too bright a glory,
We ask, Is this a dream
Or magic story?

And he says :
When I've had rapturous visions such as make
The sun turn pale, and suddenly awake,
Long must I pull at memory in this beard,
Ere I remember men and things revered.
So was it with the people of the City, and they stood in the
hall and winked staringly at one another, shouting and
dancing at intervals, capering with mad gravity, exclaiming
on the greatness of that they had witnessed. And Zeel the
garlic-seller fell upon Dob the confectioner, and cried, “Was
this so, O Dob? Wullahy! this glory, was it verily ?"
And Döb peered dimly upon Zeel, whispering solemnly,
“Say, now, art thou of a surety that Zeel the garlic-seller
known to me, my boon-fellow ?” And the twain turned to
Sallâp the broker, and exchanged interjections with him,
and with Azawool the builder, and with Krooz el Krazawik
the carrier; and they accosted Bootlbac the drum-beater,
where he stood apart, drumming the air as to a march of
triumph, and no word would he utter, neither to Zeel, nor to
Sallập, nor to Krooz el Krazawik, nor to Azawool his neigh-
bour, nor to any present, but continued drumming on the
air rapidly as in answer, increasing in the swiftness of his
drumming till it was a rage to mark him, and the excitement
about Bootlbac became as a mad eddy in the midst of a
mighty stream, he drumming the air with exceeding swiftness
to various measures, beating before him as on the tightened
skin, lost to all presences save the Identical and Shagpat.
So, they edged away from Bootlbac in awe, saying, “He's
inspired, Bootlbac! 't is the triumph of Shagpat he drummeth.”
So, they feigned to listen to him till their ears deceived
them, and they rejoiced in the velocity of the soundless
tune of Bootlbac the drum-beater, and were stirred by it,
excited to a forgetfulness of their fasting. Such was the
force of the inspiration of Bootlbac the drum-beater, caused
by the burning of the Identical.
Now, the four Kings, when they had mastered their wits,

was the King of ened dread the Kings
gazed in silence on Shagpat, and sighed and shook their heads,
and were as they that have swallowed a potent draught and
ponder sagely over the gulp. Surely, the visages of the Kings
of Shiraz and of Gâf and of Oolb betokened dread of Shagpat
and amazement at him ; but the King of the City exulted, and
the shining of content was on his countenance, and he cried,
“Wondrous !” and again, “Wullahy, wondrous !” and “Oh,
glory!” And he laughed and clucked and chuckled, and the
triumph of Shagpat was to him as a new jewel in his crown
outshining all others, and he was for awhile as the cock
smitten with the pride of his comb, the peacock magnified by
ailmiration of his tail. Then he cried, “For this, praise we
Allah and the Prophet. Wullahy,'t was wondrous !” and he
went off again into a roll of cluckings and chucklings and
exclamations of delight, crying, “Need they further proof of
the power in Shagpat now? Has he not manifested it? So
true is that saying-
The friend that flattereth weakeneth at length;
It is the foe that calleth forth our strength.'
Wondrous ! and never knew earth a thing to equal it in the
range of marvels !"
Now, ere the last word was spoken by the King, there
passed through the sky a mighty flash. Those in the hall
saw it, and the horsemen of the three cities encamped without
the walls were nigh blinded by the keenness of its blaze. So,
they looked into the height, and saw straight over the City a
speck of cloud, but no thunder came from it; and the King
cried, “ These be Genii ! the issue of this miracle is yet to
come ! look for it, and exult.” Then he turned to the other
Kings, but they were leaning to right and left in their seats,
as do the intoxicated, without strength to answer his
questioning. So, he exclaimed, “A curse on my head !
have I forgotten the laws of hospitality ? my cousins are
famished !” Now, he was giving orders for the spreading of
a sumptuous banquet when there passed through the sky

281
another mighty flash. They awaited the thunder this time
confidently, yet none came. Suddenly the King exclaimed,
66'T is the wrath of Shagpat that his assailants remain un-
castigated !" Then, cried he to the eunuchs of the guard,
“Hither with Feshnavat the son of Feil!” And the King
said to Feshnavat, “ Thou plotter! envious of Shagpat !”
Here the King, Kresnuk, fell forward at the feet of Shagpat
from sheer inanition, and the King of the City ordered
instantly wines and viands to be brought into the hall, and
commenced saying to Feshnavat, in the words of the wise
entablature :-
«« Of reckless mercy thus the Sage declared :
More culpable the sparer than the spared ;
For he that breaks one law, breaks one alone :
But who thwarts Justice flouts Law's sovereign throne.'
And have I not been over-merciful in thy case ?” As the
King was haranguing Feshnavat, his nostril took in the steam
of the viands and the fresh odours of the wines, and he could
delay no longer to satisfy his craving, but caught up the
goblet, and drank from it till his visage streamed the tears of
contentment. Lo, while he put forth his hand tremblingly,
as to continue the words of his condemnation of the Vizier,
the heavens were severed by a third flash, one exceeding in
fierceness the other flashes; and now the Great Hall rocked,
and the pillars and thrones trembled, and the eyes of Shagpat
opened. He made no motion, but sat like a wonder of stone,
looking before him. Surely, Kadza shrieked, and rushed
forward to him from the crowd, yet he said nothing, and
was as one frozen with exultation. So, the King cried, “He
waketh! the flashes preceded his wakening! Now shall he
see the vengeance of kings on his enemies." Thereupon, he
made a signal, and the scimitars of the guard were in air
over the head of Feshnavat, when darkness as of the
dropping of night fell upon all, and the darkness spake,
saying, “I am Abarak of the Bar, preceder of the Event !”

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
Then, it was light, but the ears of every soul present were
pierced with the wailing of wild animals, and on all sides from
the Desert thousands of them were seen making toward the
City, some swiftly, others at a heavy pace; and when they were
come near they crouched and fawned, and dropped their dry
tongues as in awe. There was the serpent, meek as before the
days of sin, and the leopard slinking to get among the legs of
men, and the lion came trundling along in utter flabbiness,
raising not his head. Soon the streets were thronged with
elephants and lions and sullen tigers, and wild cats and wolves,
not a tail erect among them : great was the marvel! So, the
King cried, “We 're in the thick of wonders; banquet we
lightly while they increase upon us! What 's yonder little
man?” This was Abarak that stood before the King, and
exclaimed, “I am the darkness that announceth the mastery
of the Event, as a shadow before the sun's approach, and it is
the Shaving of Shagpat !” Now the world darkened before
the eyes of the King when he heard this, and in a moment
Abarak was clutched by the soldiers of the guard, and dragged
beside Feshnavat to await the final blow; and this would have
parted two heads from two bodies at one stroke, but now
Noorna bin Noorka entered the hall, veiled and in the bright
garb of a bride, with veiled attendants about her, and the
people opened to give her passage to the throne of the King.
So, she said, “Delay the stroke yet awhile, O Head of the
Magnanimous! I am she claimed by Shagpat; surely, I am
bride of him that is Master of the Event, and the hour of
bridals is the hour of clemency.”
The King looked at Shagpat, perplexed; but the eye of
Shagpat gazed as into the distance of another world. Then,
said he, “We shall hear nought from the mouth of Shagpat
till he is avenged, and till then he is silent with exceeding
wrath.” Hearing this, Noorna ran quickly to a window of the
hall, and let loose a white dove from her bosom. Then, came
there that flash which is recorded in old traditions as the fourth
of the flashes of thunderless lightnings, after the passing of

283
which, hundreds of Fakirs that had been awaiting it saw
nothing further on this earth. Down through the hall it
swept; and lo! when the Kings and the people recovered their
sight to regard Shagpat, he was, one side of him, clean shorn,
the shaven side shining as the very moon! Surely, from that
moment there was no longer aught mortal in the combat that
ensued. For now, while amazement and horror palsied all
present, the Genie Karaz, uttering a howl of fury, shot down
the length of the hall like a black storm-bolt, and caught
up Shagpat, and whirled off with him into the air; and they
beheld him dive and dodge the lightnings that beset him from
upper heaven, catching Shagpat from them, now by the heels,
now by the hair remaining one side his head. This lasted a
full hour, when the Genie paused a second, and made a sheer
descent into the earth. Then saw they the wings of Koorookh,
each a league in length, overshadow the entire land, and on the
neck of the bird sat Shibli Bagarag cleaving through the earth
with his blade, and he sat on Koorookh as the moon sits on
the midnight. There was no light save the light shed abroad
by the flashes of the blade, and in these they beheld the air
suffocated with Afrites and Genii in a red and brown and
white heat, followers of Karaz. Strokes of the blade clove
them, and their blood was fire that flowed over the feathers of
Koorookh, lighting him in a conflagration ; but the bird flew
constantly to a fountain of earth below and extinguished it.
Then, the battle recommenced, and the solid earth yawned at
the gashes made by the mighty blade, and its depths revealed
how Karaz was flying with Shagpat from circle to circle of
the under-regions, hurrying with him downward to the lowest
circle that was flaming to points like the hair of vast heads.
Presently they saw a wondrous quivering flash divide the
Genie, and his heels and head fell together in the abysses,
leaving Shagpat prone on great brasiers of penal flame. Then,
the blade made another hissing sweep over Shagpat, leaving
little of the wondrous growths on him save a topknot.
But now was the hour struck when Rabesqurat could be held

THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT.
no longer serving the ferry in Aklis; and the terrible Queen
streamed in the sky, like a red disastrous comet, and dived,
eagle-like, into the depths, re-ascending with Shagpat in her
arms, cherishing him; and lo, there were suddenly a thousand
Shagpats multiplied about, and the hand of Shibli Bagarag
became exhausted with hewing at them. The scornful laugh
of the Queen was heard throughout earth as she triumphed over
Shibli Bagarag with hundreds of Shagpats, Illusions; and he
knew not where to strike at the Shagpat, and was losing all
sleight of hand, dexterity, and cunning. Noorna shrieked,
thinking him lost; but Abarak seized his bar, and leaning
it in the direction of Aklis, blew a pellet from it that struck
on the eye of Aklis, and this sent out a stretching finger of
beams, and singled forth very Shagpat from the myriads of
semblances, so that he glowed and was ruddy, the rest
cowering pale, and dissolving like salt-grains in water.
Then saw Earth and its inhabitants how the Genie Karaz
re-ascended in the shape of a vulture with a fire-beak,
pecking at the eyes of him that wielded the Sword, so that
he was bewildered and shook this way and that over the
neck of Koorookh, striking wildly, languidly cleaving towers
and palaces, and monuments of earth underneath him.
Now, Shibli Bagarag discerned his danger, and considered,
“The power of the Sword is to sever brains and thoughts.
Great is Allah! I 'll seek my advantage in that.” So, he
whirled Koorookh thrice in the crimson smoke of the
atmosphere, and put the blade between the first and second
thought in the head of Rabesqurat, so that the sense of the
combat became immediately confused in her mind, and she
used her powers as the fool does, equally against all, for the
sake of mischief solely-no longer mistress of her own
Illusions; and she began doubling and trebling Shibli
Bagarag on the neck of monstrous birds, speeding in draggled
flightiness from one point of the sky to another. Even in
the terror of the combat, Shibli Bagarag was fain to burst
into a fit of violent laughter at the sight of the Queen

285
wagging her neck loosely, perking it like a mad raven; and
he took heart, and swept the blade rapidly over Shagpat as
she dandled him, leaving Shagpat but one hair remaining on
him; yet was that the Identical; and it arose, and was a
serpent in his head, and from its jaws issued a river of fiery
serpents: these and a host of Afrites besieged Shibli Bagarag;
and now, to defend himself, he unloosed the twin Genii,
Karavejis and Veejravoosh, from the wrist of that hand
which wielded the Sword of Aklis, and these alternately
interwound before and about him, and were even as a
glittering armour of emerald plates, warding from him the
assaults of the host; and lo! he flew, and the battle followed
him over blazing cities and lands on fire with the slanting
hail of sparkles.
By this time every soul in the City of Shagpat, kings and
people, all save Abarak and Noorna bin Noorka, were over-
come and prostrate with their faces to the ground; but
Noorna watched the conflict eagerly, and saw the head of
Shagpat sprouting incessant fresh crops of hair, despite the
pertinacious shearing of her betrothed. Then, she smote
her hands, and cried, “Yea! though I lose my beauty and
the love of my betrothed, I must join in this, or he'll be
lost.” So, saying to Abarak, “Watch over me," she went
into the air, and, as she passed Rabesqurat, was multiplied
into twenty damsels of loveliness. Then, Abarak beheld
a scorpion following the twenty in mid-air, and darting
stings among them. Noorna tossed a ring, and it fell in
a circle of flame round the scorpion. So, while the scorpion
was shooting in squares to escape from the circle, the fire-
beaked vulture flew to it, and fluttered a dense rain which
swallowed the flame, and the scorpion and vulture assailed
Noorna, that was changed to a golden hawk in the midst of
nineteen other golden hawks. Now, as Rabesqurat came
scudding by, and saw the encounter, she made the twenty
hawks a hundred. The Genie Karaz howled at her, and
pinioned her to a pillar below in the Desert, with Shagpat in

her arms. But, as he soared aloft to renew the fight with
Noorna, Shibli Bagarag loosed to her aid the Slaves of the
Sword, and Abarak marked him slope to a distant corner of
earth, and re-ascend in a cloud, which drew swiftly over the
land toward the Great Hall. Lo, Shibli Bagarag stepped from
it through a casement of the hall, and with him Shagpat, a slack
weight, mazed out of all power of motion. Koorookh swooped
low; on his back Baba Mustapha, and Shibli Bagarag flung
Abarak beside him on the bird. Then, Koorookh whirred off
with them; and while the heavens raged, Shibli Bagarag pre-
pared a rapid lather, and dashed it over Shagpat, and com-
menced shearing him with lightning sweeps of the blade.
'T was as a racing wheel of fire to see him! Suddenly he de-
sisted, and wiped the sweat from his face. Then, calling on the
name of Allah, he gave a last keen cunning sweep with the
blade, and following that, the earth awfully quaked and
groaned, as if speaking in the abysmal tongue the Mastery of
the Event to all men. Aklis was revealed in burning beams
as of a sun, and the trouble of the air ceased, vapours slowly
curling to the four quarters. Shibli Bagarag had smitten
clean through the Identical! Terribly had Noorna and those
that aided her been oppressed by the multitude of their
enemies; but, in a moment these melted away, and Karaz,
together with the scorpion that was Goorelka, vanished. Day
was on the baldness of Shagpat.

CONCLUSION.
So was shaved Shagpat, the son of Shimpoor, the son of
Shoolpi, the son of Shullum, by Shibli Bagarag, of Shiraz,
according to preordainment.
The chronicles relate, that no sooner had he mastered the
Event, than men on the instant perceived what illusion had
beguiled them, and, in the words of the poet,
The blush, with which their folly they confess,
Is the first prize of his supreme success.
Even Bootlbac, the drum-beater, drummed in homage to him,
and the four Kings were they that were loudest in their re-
vilings of the spouse of Kadza, and most obsequious in praises
of the Master. The King of the City was fain to propitiate
his people by a voluntary resignation of his throne to Shibli
Bagarag, and that King took well to heart the wisdom of the
sage, when he says:
Power, on Illusion based, o'ertoppeth all;
The more disastrous is its certain fall!
Surely, Shibli Bagarag returned the Sword to the Sons of Aklis,
flashing it in midnight air, and they, with the others, did reve-
rence to his achievement. They were now released from the
toil of sharpening the Sword a half-cycle of years, to wander
in delight on the fair surface of the flowery earth, breathing its
roses, wooing its brides ; for the mastery of an Event lasteth

among men the space of one cycle of years, and after that a
fresh Illusion springeth to befool mankind, and the seven
must expend the concluding half-cycle in preparing the edge
of the Sword for a new mastery. As the poet declareth in
his scorn:
Some doubt Eternity: from life begin,
Has folly ceased within them, sire to son ?
So, ever fresh Illusions will arise
And lord creation, until men are wise.
And he adds :
That is a distant period; so prepare
To fight the false, O youths, and never spare !
For who would live in chronicles renown'd
Must combat folly, or as fool be crown'd.
Now, for the Kings of Shiraz and of Gâf, Shibli Bagarag
entertained them in honour; but the King of Qolb he dis-
graced and stripped of his robes, to invest Baba Mustapha
in those royal emblems—a punishment to the treachery of
the King of Oolb, as is said by Aboo Eznol:
When nations with opposing forces, rash,
Shatter each other, thou that wouldst have stood
A part to profit by the monstrous feud,
Thou art the surest victim of the crash.
Take colours of whichever side thou wilt,
And steadfastly thyself in battle range;
Yet, having taken, shouldst thou dare to change,
Suspicion hunts thee as a thing of guilt.
Baba Mustapha was pronounced Sovereign of Oolb, amid
the acclamations of the guard encamped under the command
of Ravaloke, without the walls.
No less did Shibli Bagarag honour the benefactor of Noorna,
making him chief of his armies; and he, with his own hand,
bestowed on the good old warrior the dress of honour pre-
tented to him by the Seven Sons, charactered with all the

mysteries of Aklis, a marvel lost to men in the failure to
master the Illusion now dominating earth.
So, of all that had worshipped Shagpat, only Kadza clung
to him, and she departed with him into the realms of
Rabesqurat, who reigned there, divided against herself by the
stroke of the Sword. The Queen is no longer mighty, for
the widening of her power has weakened it, she being now
the mistress of the single-thoughted, and them that follow
one idea to the exclusion of a second. The failure in the
unveiling of her last-cherished Illusion was in the succumb-
ing frailty of him that undertook the task, the world and its
wise men having come to the belief that in thwackings there
was ignominy to the soul of man, and a tarnish on the lustre
of heroes. On that score, hear the words of the poet, a vain
protest: .
Ye that nourish hopes of fame!
Ye who would be known in song!
Ponder old history, and duly frame
Your souls to meek acceptance of the thong.
Lo ! of hundreds who aspire,
Eighties perish--nineties tire!
They who bear up, in spite of wrecks and wracks,
Were season'd by celestial hail of thwacks.
Fortune in this mortal race
Builds on thwackings for its base;
Thus the All-Wise doth make a flail a staff,
And separates his heavenly corn from chaff.
Think ye, had he never known
Noorna a belabouring crone,
Shibli Bagarag would have shaved Shagpat?
The unthwack'd lives in chronicle a rat!
'T is the thwacking in this den
Maketh lions of true men!
So are we nerved to break the clinging mesh
Which tames the noblest efforts of poor flesh.
Feshnavat became his Vizier, and Abarak remained at the
right hand of Shibli Bagarag, his slave in great adventure.

No other condition than bondage gave peace to Abarak. He
was of the class enumerated by the sage:
Who, with the strength of giants, are but tools,
The weighty hands which serve selected fools.
Now, this was how it was in the case of Baba Mustapha, and
the four Kings, and Feshnavat, and Abarak, and Ravaloke, and
Kadza, together with Shagpat; but, in the case of Noorna bin
Noorka, surely she was withering from a sting of the scorpion
shot against her bosom, but the Seven Sons of Aklis gave
her a pass into Aklis on the wings of Koorookh, and Gul-
revaz, the daughter of Aklis, tended her, she that was alone
capable of restoring her, and counteracting the malice of the
scorpion by the hand of purity. So, Noorna prospered; but
Shibli Bagarag drooped in uncertainty of her state, and was
as a reaper in a field of harvest, around whom lie the yellow
sheaves, and the brown beam of autumn on his head, the
blaze of plenty ; yet is he rejoiceless and stands musing, for
one is away who should be there, and without whom the
goblet of Success giveth an unsweetened draught, and there
is nothing pleasant in life, and the flower on the summit of
achievement is blighted. At last, as he was listlessly dis-
pensing justice in the Great Hall, seven days after the
mastery of the Event, lo, Noorna in air, borne by Gulrevaz!
she fair and fresh in the revival of health and beauty, and
the light of constant love. Of her entry into the Great Hall,
to the embrace of her betrothed, the poet exclaims, picturing
her in a rapture :
Her march is music, and my soul obeys
Each motion, as a lute to cunning fingers :
I see the earth throb for her as she sways
Wave-like in air, and like a great flower lingers
Heavily over all, as loath to leave
What loves her so, and for her loss would grieve.
But oh, what other hand than Heaven's can paint
Her eyes, and that black bow from which their lightning
Pierces afar! long lastrous eyes, that faint
In languor, or with stormy passion brightening :

Within them world in world lights up from sleep,
And gives a glimpse of the eternal deep.
Sigh round her, odorous winds; and, envious rose,
So vainly envious, with such blushes gifted,
Bow to her; die, strangled with jealous throes,
O Bulbul! when she sings with brow uplifted ;
Gather her, happy youth, and for thy gain
Thank Him who could such loveliness ordain.
Surely, the Master of the Event advanced to her in the glory
of a Sultan, and seated her beside him in majesty, and their
contract of marriage was read aloud in the hall, and witnessed,
and sealed : joyful was he! Then, commenced that festival
which lasted forty days, and is termed the Festival of the
honours of hospitality to the Sons of Aklis, wherein the
head-cook of the palace, Uruish, performed wonders in his
science, and menaced the renown of Zrmack, the head-cook
of King Shamshureen. Even so the confectioner, Döb,
excelled himself in devices and inventions, and his genius
urged him to depict in sugars and pastes the entire adventures
of Shibli Bagarag in search of the Sword. Honour we
Uruish and Dõb! as the poet sayeth :
Divide not this fraternal twain;
One are they, and one should for ever remain :
As to sweet close in fine music we look,
So the Confectioner follows the Cook.
And one of the Sons of Aklis, Zaragal, beholding this
masterpiece of Döb which was served to the guests in the
Great Hall on the fortieth evening, was fain to exclaim in
extemporaneous verse :
Have I been wafted to a rise
Of banquet spread in Paradise,
Dower'd with consuming powers divine,
And stately,
That I, who have not fail'd to dine,
And greatly,
Fall thus upon the cates and wine
Sedately ?

So there was feasting in the Hall, and in the City, and
over Earth; great pledging the Sovereign of Barbers, who
had mastered an Event, and become the benefactor of his
craft and of his kind. 'T is certain the race of the Bagarags
endured for many centuries, and his seed were the rulers of
men, and the seal of their empire stamped on mighty wax
the Tackle of Barbers.
Now,of the promise made by the Sons of Aklis to visit Shibli
Bagarag before their compulsory return to the labour of the
Sword, and recount to him the marvel of their antecedent
adventures, and of the love and grief nourished in the souls
of men by the beauty and sorrowful eyes of Gulrevaz, that
was named the Bleeding Lily, and of her engagement to tell
her story, on condition of receiving the first-born of Noorna
to nurse for a season in Aklis; and of Shibli Bagarag's
restoration of towns and monuments destroyed by his battle
with Karaz; and of the constancy of passion of Shibli
Bagarag for Noorna, and his esteem for her sweetness, and
his reverence for her wisdom; and of the glory of his reign,
and of the Songs and Sentences of Noorna, and of his Laws
for the protection and upholding of women, in honour of
Noorna, concerning which the Sage has said :
Were men once clad in them, we should create
A race not following, but commanding, fate :
-of all these records, and of the reign of Baba Mustapha in :
Oolb, surely the chronicles give them in fulness; and they
that have searched say of them, there is matter therein for
the amusement of generations.

THE WHITE ROSE CLUB.
In those lusty ages when the Kaisers lifted high the golden
goblet of Aachen, and drank, elbow upwards, the green-eyed
wine of old romance, there lived, a bow-shot from the bones
of the Eleven Thousand Virgins and the Three Holy Kings,
a prosperous Rhinelander, by name Gottlieb Groschen, or, as
it was sometimes ennobled, Gottlieb von Groschen ; than
whom no wealthier merchant bartered for the glory of his
ancient mother-city, nor more honoured burgess swallowed
impartially red juice and white under the shadow of his own
fig-tree.
Vine-hills, among the hottest sun-bibbers of the Rheingau,
glistened in the roll of Gottlieb's possessions; corn-acres
below Cologne; basalt-quarries about Linz; mineral-springs
in Nassau, a legacy of the Romans to the genius and enter-
prise of the first of German traders. He could have bought
up every hawking crag, owner and all, from Hatto's Tower
to Rheineck. Lore-ley, combing her yellow locks against
the night-cloud, beheld old Gottlieb's rafts endlessly stealing
on the moonlight through the iron pass she peoples above
St. Goar. A wailful host were the wives of his raftsmen
widowed there by her watery music!
This worthy citizen of Cologne held vasty manuscript
letters of the Kaiser addressed to him :

man in one bodottlieb was a minces of the How
“Dear well-born son and subject of mine, Gottlieb !”
and he was easy with the proudest princes of the Holy
German Realm. For Gottlieb was a money-lender and an
honest man in one body. He laid out for the plenteous
harvests of usury, not pressing the seasons with too much
rigour. “I sow my seed in winter," said he, “and hope to
reap good profit in autumn; but if the crop be scanty,
better let it lie and fatten the soil.”
“Old earth's the wisest creditor," he would add ; "she
never squeezes the sun, but just takes what he can give her
year by year, and so makes sure of good annual interest.”
Therefore when people asked Gottlieb how he had risen
to such a pinnacle of fortune, the old merchant screwed his
eye into its wisest corner, and answered slyly, “Because I've
always been a student of the heavenly bodies ;” a communi-
cation which failed not to make the orbs and systems objects
of ardent popular worship in Cologne, where the science was
long since considered alchymic, and still may be.
Seldom could the Kaiser go to war on Welschland without
first taking earnest counsel of his well-born son and subject
Gottlieb, and lightening his chests. Indeed the imperial
pastime must have ceased, and the Kaiser had languished
but for him. Cologne counted its illustrious citizen some-
thing more than man. The burghers doffed when he passed;
and scampish leather-draggled urchins gazed after him with
preternatural respect on their hanging chins, as if a gold-
mine of great girth had walked through the awe-struck game.
But for the young men of Cologne he had a higher claim
to reverence as father of the fair Margarita, the White Rose
of Germany; a noble maiden, peerless, and a jewel for
princes.
The devotion of these youths should give them a name in
chivalry. In her honour, daily and nightly, they earned
among themselves black bruises and paraded discoloured
countenances, with the humble hope to find it pleasing in
her sight. The tender fanatics went in bands up and down

Rhineland, challenging the peasantry with staff and beaker
to acknowledge the supremacy of their mistress. Whoso of
them journeyed into foreign parts, wrote home boasting how
many times his head had been broken on behalf of the fair
Margarita ; and if this happened very often, a spirit of
burning envy was created, which compelled him, when he
returned, to verify his prowess on no less than a score of his
rivals. Not to possess a beauty-scar, as the wounds received
in these endless combats were called, became a sign of
wretchedness so abject that much voluntary maiming was
conjectured to be going on; and to obviate this piece of
treachery, minutes of fights were taken and attested, setting
forth that a certain glorious cut or crack was honourably
won in fair field ; on what occasion ; and from whom ; every
member of the White Rose Club keeping his particular
scroll, and, on days of festival and holiday, wearing it
haughtily in his helm. Strangers entering Cologne were
astonished at the hideous appearance of these strutting
striplings, and thought they never had observed so ugly a
race; but they were forced to admit the fine influence
of beauty on commerce, seeing that the consumption of beer
increased almost hourly. All Bavaria could not equal
Cologne for quantity made away with.
The chief members of the White Rose Club were
Berthold Schmidt, the rich goldsmith's son ; Dietrich Schill,
son of the imperial saddler; Heinrich Abt, Franz Endermann,
and Ernst Geller, sons of chief burghers, each of whom car-
ried a yard-long scroll in his cap, and was much too dis-
figured in person for men to require any inspection of the
document. · They were dangerous youths to meet, for the
oaths, ceremonies, and recantations they demanded from
every wayfarer, under the rank of baron, were what few might
satisfactorily perform, if lovers of woman other than the
fair Margarita, or loyal husbands; and what none save trained
heads and stomachs could withstand, however naturally manful.
The captain of the club was he who could drink most beer

without intermediate sighing, and whose face reckoned the
proudest number of slices and mixture of colours. The cap-
taincy was most in dispute between Dietrich Schill and
Berthold Schmidt, who, in the heat and constancy of conten-
tion, were gradually losing likeness to man. “Good coin,"
they gloried to reflect, “needs no stamp."
One youth in Cologne held out against the standing
tyranny, and chose to do beauty homage in his own fashion,
and at his leisure. It was Farina, and deadly oaths were
registered against him over empty beer-barrels. An axiom
of the White Rose Club laid it down that everybody must
be enamoured of Margarita, and the conscience of the club
made them trebly suspicious of those who were not members.
They had the consolation of knowing that Farina was poor,
but then he was affirmed a student of Black Arts, and from
such a one the worst might reasonably be feared. He might
bewitch Margarita !
Dietrich Schill was deputed by the club to sound the
White Rose herself on the subject of Farina, and one after-
noon in the vintage season, when she sat under the hot vine-
poles among maiden friends, eating ripe grapes, up sauntered
Dietrich, smirking, cap in hand, with his scroll trailed behind
him.
“Wilt thou ?” said Margarita, offering him a bunch.
“Unhappy villain that I am !” replied Dietrich, gesticu-
lating fox-like refusal; “if I but accept a favour, I break
faith with the club.”
“Break it to pleasure me,” said Margarita, smiling wickedly.
Dietrich gasped. He stood on tiptoe to see if any of the
club were by, and half-stretched out his hand. A mocking
laugh caused him to draw it back as if stung. The grapes
fell. Farina was at Margarita's feet offering them in return.
“ Wilt thou ?” said Margarita, with softer stress, and slight
excess of bloom in her cheeks.
Farina put the purple cluster to his breast, and clutched
them hard on his heart, still kneeling.

· Margarita's brow and bosom seemed to be reflections of the
streaming crimson there. She shook her face to the sky, and
affected laughter at the symbol. Her companions clapped
hands. Farina's eyes yearned to her once, and then he rose
and joined in the pleasantry.
Fury helped Dietrich to forget his awkwardness. He
touched Farina on the shoulder with two fingers, and mut-
tered huskily: “The club never allow that.”
Farina bowed, as to thank him deeply for the rules of the
club. “I am not a member, you know," said he, and strolled
to a seat close by Margarita.
Dietrich glared after him. As head of a club he understood
the use of symbols. He had lost a splendid opportunity, and
Farina had seized it. Farina had robbed him.
“May I speak with Mistress Margarita ?" inquired the
White Rose chief, in a ragged voice.
“Surely, Dietrich ! do speak,” said Margarita.
" Alone ?” he continued.
“Is that allowed by the club ?” said one of the young
girls, with a saucy glance.
Dietrich deigned no reply, but awaited Margarita's decision.
She hesitated a second; then stood up her full height before
him; faced him steadily, and beckoned him some steps up
the vine-path. Dietrich bowed, and passing Farina, in-
formed him that the club would wring satisfaction out of him
for the insult.
Farina laughed, but answered, “Look, you of the club!
beer-swilling has improved your manners as much as fighting
has beautified your faces. Go on; drink and fight! but
remember that the Kaiser's coming, and fellows with him
who will not be bullied.”
“What mean you ?” cried Dietrich, lurching round on
his enemy.
“Not so loud, friend,” returned Farina. “Or do you
wish to frighten the maidens? I mean this, that the club
had better give as little offence as possible, and keep their

eyes as wide as they can, if they want to be of service to
Mistress Margarita.”
Dietrich turned off with a grunt.
“Now !” said Margarita.
She was tapping her foot. Dietrich grew unfaithful to
the club, and looked at her longer than his mission warranted.
She was bright as the sunset gardens of the Golden Apples.
The braids of her yellow hair were bound in wreaths, and
on one side of her head a saffron crocus was stuck with the
bell downward. Sweetness, song, and wit hung like dews of
morning on her grape-stained lips. She wore a scarlet
corset with bands of black velvet across her shoulders. The
girlish gown was thin blue stuff, and fell short over her firm-
set feet, neatly cased in white leather with buckles. There
was witness in her limbs and the way she carried her neck
of an amiable, but capable, dragon, ready, when aroused, to
bristle up and guard the Golden Apples against all save the
rightful claimant. Yet her nether-lip and little white chin-
ball had a dreamy droop; her frank blue eyes went straight
into the speaker: the dragon slept. It was a dangerous
charm. “For,” says the minnesinger, “what ornament more
enchants us on a young beauty than the soft slumber of a
strength never yet called forth, and that herself knows not
of! It sings double things to the heart of knighthood;
lures, and warns us ; woos, and threatens. 'Tis as nature,
shining peace, yet the mother of storm." .
“There is no man,” rapturously exclaims Heinrich von
der Jungferweide, “can resist the desire to win a sweet
treasure before which lies a dragon sleeping. The very
danger prattles promise."
But the dragon must really sleep, as with Margarita.
“A sham dragon, shamming sleep, has destroyed more
virgins than all the heathen emperors,” says old Hans
Aepfelmann of Düsseldorf.
Margarita's foot was tapping quicker.
"Speak, Dietrich !” she said.

Dietrich declared to the club that at this point he muttered,
“We love you." Margarita was glad to believe he had not
spoken of himself. He then informed her of the fears enter-
tained by the club, sworn to watch over and protect her,
regarding Farina's arts.
“And what fear you ?” said Margarita.
“We fear, sweet mistress, he may be in league with
Sathanas,” replied Dietrich.
“Truly, then," said Margarita, “ of all the youths in
Cologne he is the least like his confederate.”
Dietrich gulped and winked, like a patient recovering
wry-faced from an abhorred potion.
“We have warned you, Fräulein Groschen !” he ex-
claimed. “It now becomes our duty to see that you are not
snared.”
Margarita reddened, and returned : “You are kind. But
I am a Christian maiden and not a Pagan soldan, and I do
not require a body of tawny guards at my heels.”
Thereat she flung back to her companions, and began
staining her pretty mouth with grapes anew.

THE TAPESTRY WORK.
Fair maids will have their hero in history. Siegfried was
Margarita's chosen. She sang of Siegfried all over the
house. “O the old days of Germany, when such a hero
walked !” she sang.
“And who wins Margarita,” mused Farina, "happier than
Siegfried, has in his arms Brunhild and Chrimhild together!”
Crowning the young girl's breast was a cameo, and the
skill of some cunning artist out of Welschland had wrought
on it the story of the Drachenfels. Her bosom heaved the
battle up and down.
This cameo was a north star to German manhood, but
caused many chaste expressions of abhorrence from Aunt
Lisbeth, Gottlieb's unmarried sister, who seemed instinctively
to take part with the Dragon. She was a frail-fashioned little
old lady, with a face betokening the perpetual smack of
lemon, and who reigned in her brother's household when the
good wife was gone. Margarita's robustness was beginning
to alarm and shock Aunt Lisbeth's sealed stock of virtue.
“She must be watched, such a mädl as that,” said Aunt
Lisbeth. “Ursula ! what limbs she has !"
Margarita was watched; but the spy being neither foe nor
friend, nothing was discovered against her. This did not
satisfy Aunt Lisbeth, whose own suspicion was her best
witness. She allowed that Margarita dissembled well.
“ But,” said she to her niece, “though it is good in a girl

not to flaunt these naughtinesses in effrontery, I care for you
too much not to say-Be what you seem, my little one !”
“And that am I !” exclaimed Margarita, starting up and
towering.
“Right good, my niece," Lisbeth squealed; “but now
Frau Groschen lies in God's acre, you owe your duty to me,
mind ! Did you confess last week ? ”
“ From beginning to end,” replied Margarita.
Aunt Lisbeth fixed pious reproach on Margarita's cameo.
“And still you wear that thing ?”
“Why not ? ” said Margarita.
“Girl! who would bid you set it in such a place save
Satan? Oh, thou poor lost child ! that the eyes of the idle
youths may be drawn there ! and thou become his snare to
others, Margarita ! What was that Welsh wandering
juggler but the foul fiend himself, mayhap, thou maiden of
sin! They say he has been seen in Cologne lately. He
was swarthy as Satan and limped of one leg. Good Master
in heaven, protect us ! it was Satan himself I could swear!”
Aunt Lisbeth crossed brow and breast in terror.
Margarita had commenced fingering the cameo, as if to tear
it away; but Aunt Lisbeth's finish made her laugh outright.
“Where I see no harm, aunty, I shall think the good God
is," she answered ; “and where I see there's harm, I shall
think Satan lurks."
A simper of sour despair passed over Aunt Lisbeth. She
sighed, and was silent, being one of those very weak reeds
who are easily vanquished and never overcome.
“Let us go on with the Tapestry, child,” said she.
Now, Margarita was ambitious of completing a certain
Tapestry for presentation to Kaiser Heinrich on his entry
into Cologne after his last campaign on the turbaned Danube.
The subject was again her beloved Siegfried slaying the
Dragon on Drachenfels. Whenever Aunt Lisbeth indulged
in any bitter virginity, and was overmatched by Margarita's
frank maidenhood, she hung out this tapestry as a flag of

truce. They were working it in bits, not having contrivances
to do it in a piece. Margarita took Siegfried and Aunt Lisbeth
the Dragon. They shared the crag between them. A
roughish gleam of the Rhine toward Nonnenwerth could be
already made out, Roland's Corner hanging like a sentinel
across the chanting island, as one top-heavy with long watch.
Aunt Lisbeth was a great proficient in the art, and had
taught Margarita. The little lady learnt it, with many other
gruesome matters, in the Palatine of Bohemia's family. She
usually talked of the spectres of Höllenbogenblitz Castle in
the passing of the threads. Those were dismal spectres in
Bohemia, smelling of murder and the charnel-breath of mid-
night. They uttered noises that wintered the blood, and revealed
sights that stiffened hair three feet long; ay, and kept it stiff !
Margarita placed herself on a settle by the low-arched
window, and Aunt Lisbeth sat facing her. An evening sun
blazoned the buttresses of the Cathedral, and shadowed the
work-frames of the peaceful couple to a temperate light.
Margarita unrolled a sampler sheathed with twists of divers
coloured threads, and was soon busy silver-threading Siegfried's
helm and horns.
"I told you of the steward, poor Kraut, did I not, Child ? "
inquired Aunt Lisbeth, quietly clearing her throat.
“Many times !” said Margarita, and went on humming
over her knee:
“Her love was a Baron,
A Baron so bold;
She loved him for love,
He loved her for gold.”
“He must see for himself, and be satisfied,” continued
Aunt Lisbeth; "and Holy Thomas to warn him for an
example! Poor Kraut !”
“Poor Kraut !” echoed Margarita.
“ The King loved wine, and the Knight loved wine,
And they loved the summer weather :
They might have loved each other well,
But for one they loved together."

“ You may say, poor Kraut, child !” said Aunt Lisbeth.
“ Well! his face was before that as red as this dragon's jaw,
and ever after he went about as white as a pullet's egg.
That was something wonderful !”
“ That was it !” chimed Margarita.
“O the King he loved his lawful wife,
The Knight a lawless lady :
And ten on one made ringing strife,
Beneath the forest shady."
“Fifty to one, child !” said Aunt Lisbeth. “You forget
the story. They made Kraut sit with them at the jabbering
feast, the only mortal there. The walls were full of eye-
sockets without eyes, but phosphorus instead, burning blue
and damp."
“Not to-night, aunty dear! It frightens me so," pleaded
Margarita, for she saw the dolor coming.
"Night! when it's broad mid-day, thou timid one! Good
Heaven take pity on such as thou! The dish was seven feet
in length by four broad. Kraut measured it with his eye,
and never forgot it. Not he! When the dish-cover was
lifted, there he saw himself lying, boiled !
"I did not feel uncomfortable then,' Kraut told us. It
seemed natural.'
“His face, as it lay there, he says, was quite calm, only a
little wrinkled, and piggish-looking-like. There was the
mole on his chin, and the pucker under his left eyelid. Well!
the Baron carved. All the guests were greedy for a piece of
him. Some cried out for breast; some for toes. It was
shuddering cold to sit and hear that! The Baroness said,
Cheek !'”
“Ah!” shrieked Margarita, “ that can I not bear! I will
not hear it, aunt; I will not !”
“Cheek !" Aunt-Lisbeth reiterated, nodding to the floor.
Margarita put her fingers to her ears.
“Still, Kraut says, even then he felt nothing odd. Of
course he was horrified to be sitting with spectres as you and

I should be ; but the first tremble of it was over. He had
plunged into the bath of horrors, and there he was. I've
heard that you must pronounce the names of the Virgin and
Trinity, sprinkling water round you all the while for three
minutes ; and if you do this without interruption, everything
shall disappear. So they say. 'Oh! dear Heaven of mercy!'
says Kraut, what I felt when the Baron laid his long hunting-
knife across my left cheek !'".
Here Aunt Lisbeth lifted her eyes to dote upon Margarita's
fright. She was very displeased to find her niece, with elbows
on the window-sill and hands round her head, quietly gazing
into the street.
She said severely, “Where did you learn that song you
were last singing, Margarita ? Speak, thou girl !”
Margarita laughed.
“The thrush, and the lark, and the blackbird,
They taught me how to sing :
And o that the hawk would lend his eye,
And the eagle lend his wing,"
“I will not hear these shameless songs,” exclaimed Aunt
Lisbeth.
“ For I would view the lands they view,
And be where they have been :
It is not enough to be singing
For ever in dells unseen!”
A voice was heard applauding her. “Good ! right good !
Carol again, Gretelchen! my birdie!"
Margarita turned, and beheld her father in the doorway.
She tripped towards him, and heartily gave him their kiss
of meeting. Gottlieb glanced at the helm of Siegfried.
“Guessed the work was going well; you sing so light-
somely ito-day, Grete! Very pretty! And that's Drachenfels ?
Bones of the Virgins! what a bold fellow was Siegfried, and
a lucky, to have the neatest lass in Deutschland in love
with him. Well, we muist marry her to Siegfried after all,

I believe! Aha? or somebody as good as Siegfried. So
chirrup on, my darling !”
“Aunt Lisbeth does not approve of my songs,” replied
Margarita, untwisting some silver threads.
“Do thy father's command, girl !” said Aunt Lisbeth.
“And doing his command,
Should I do a thing of ill,-
I'd rather die to his lovely face,
Than wanton at his will."
“There—there,” said Aunt Lisbeth, straining out her
fingers ; "you see, Gottlieb, what over-indulgence brings her
to. Not another girl in blessed Rhineland, and Bohemia to
boot, dared say such words !-than-I can't repeat them !
-don't ask me !-She's becoming a Frankish girl !”
“What ballad's that?” said Gottlieb, smiling.
“The Ballad of Holy Ottilia ; and her lover was sold to
darkness. And she loved him-loved him—"
“As you love Siegfried, you little one ?”
“More, my father ; for she saw Winkried, and I never
saw Siegfried. Ah! if I had seen Siegfried ! Never mind.
She loved him ; but she loved Virtue more. And Virtue is
the child of God, and the good God forgave her for loving
Winkried, the Devil's son, because she loved Virtue more,
and He rescued her as she was being dragged down-down
-down, and was half fainting with the smell of brimstone-
rescued her and had her carried into His Glory, head and
feet, on the wings of angels, before all men, as a hope
to little maidens.
“And when I thought that I was lost,
I found that I was saved,
And I was borne through blessed clouds,
Where the banners of bliss were waved.”
“And so you think you, too, may fall in love with
Devils' sons, girl ?" was Aunt Lisbeth's comment.

“Do look at Lisbeth's Dragon, little Heart! it's so like !"
said Margarita to her father.
Old Gottlieb twitted his hose, and chuckled.
“She's my girl! that may be seen,” said he, patting her,
and wheezed up from his chair to waddle across to the Dragon.
But Aunt Lisbeth tartly turned the Dragon to the wall.
“ It is not yet finished, Gottlieb, and must not be looked
at,” she interposed. “I will call for wood, and see to a
fire: these evenings of spring wax cold : ” and away
whimpered Aunt Lisbeth.
Margarita sang:
“I with my playmates,
In riot and disorder,
Were gathering herb and blossom
Along the forest border.”
“Thy mother's song, child of my heart !” said Gottlieb;
“but vex not good Lisbeth : she loves thee !'
“ And do you think she loves me ?
And will you say 'tis true ?
0, and will she have me,
When I come up to woo ?”
“ Thou leaping doe! thou chattering pie !” said Gottlieb.
" She shall have ribbons and trinkets,
And shine like a morn of May,
When we are off to the little hill-church,
Our flowery bridal way.”
“That she shall; and something more ! ” cried Gottlieb.
“But, hark thee, Gretelchen; the Kaiser will be here in
three days. Thou dear one! had I not stored and hoarded
all for thee, I should now have my feet on a hearthstone
where even he might warm his boot. So get thy best
dresses and jewels in order, and look thyself, proud as any
in the land. A simple burgher's daughter now, Grete; but
so shalt thou not end, my butterfly, or there's neither worth
nor wit in Gottlieb Groschen!”

“Three days !" Margarita exclaimed; "and the helm not
finished, and the tapestry-pieces not sewed and joined, and
the water not shaded off.-Oh! I must work night and day.”
“Child! I'll have no working at night! Your rosy
cheeks will soon be sucked out by oil-light, and you look no
better than poor tallow court beauties—to say nothing of the
danger. This old house saw Charles the Great embracing
the chief magistrate of his liege city yonder. Some swear
he slept in it. He did not sneeze at smaller chambers than
our Kaisers abide. No gold ceilings with cornice carvings,
but plain wooden beams."
“Know that the men of great renown,
Were men of simple needs :
Bare to the Lord they laid them down,
And slept on mighty deeds.”
“God wot, there's no emptying thy store of ballads, Grete :
so much shall be said of thee. Yes ; times are changing.
We're growing degenerate. Yes; yes! Look at the men
of Linz now to what they were ! Would they have let the
lads of Andernach float down cabbage-stalks to them without
a shy back ? And why? All because they funck that
brigand-beast Werner, who gets redemption from Laach,
hard by his hold, whenever he commits a crime worth
paying for. As for me, my timber and stuffs must come
down stream, and are too good for the nixen under Rhine, or
think you I would acknowledge him with a toll, the hell-
dog? Thunder and lightning! if old scores could be
rubbed out on his hide !”
Gottlieb whirled a thong-lashing arm in air, and groaned
of law and justice. What were they coming to !
Margarita softened the theme with a verse :
" And tho' to sting his enemy,
Is sweetness to the angry bee,
The angry bee must busy be,
Ere sweet of sweetness hiveth he."

The arch thrill of his daughter's voice tickled Gottlieb.
“That's it, birdie ! You and the proverb are right. I don't
know which is best-
“ Better hive
And keep alive ;
Than vengeance wake
With that you take.”
A clatter in the cathedral square brought Gottlieb on his
legs to the window. It was a company of horsemen
sparkling in harness. One trumpeter rode at the side of the
troop, and in front a standard-bearer, matted down the chest
with ochre beard, displayed aloft to the good citizens of
Cologne, three brown hawks, with birds in their beaks, on an
azure star-dotted field.
“ Holy cross !” exclaimed Gottlieb, low in his throat;
" the arms of Werner! Where got he money to mount his
men? Why, this is daring all Cologne in our very teeth !
?Fend that he visit me now! Ruin smokes in that ruffian's
track. I've felt hot and cold by turns all day.”
The horsemen came jingling carelessly along the street in
scattered twos and threes, laughing together, and singling
out the maidens at the gable-shadowed windows with
hawking eyes. The good citizens of Cologne did not look
on them favourably. Some showed their backs and gruffly
banged their doors : others scowled and pocketed their fists:
not a few slunk into the side alleys like well-licked curs,
and scurried off with forebent knees. They were in truth
ferocious-looking fellows these trusty servants of the robber
Baron Werner, of Werner's Eck, behind Andernach.
Leather, steel, and dust, clad them from head to foot; big
and black as bears; wolf-eyed, fox-nosed. They glistened
bravely in the falling beams of the sun, and Margarita
thrust her fair braided yellow head a little forward over her
father's shoulder to catch the whole length of the grim
cavalcade. One of the troop was not long in discerning the

young beauty. He pointed her boldly out to a comrade, who
approved his appetite, and referred her to a third. The rest
followed lead, and Margarita was as one spell-struck when she
became aware that all those hungry eyes were preying on
hers. Old Gottlieb was too full of his own fears to think
for her, and when he drew in his head rather suddenly, it
was with a dismal foreboding that Werner's destination in
Cologne was direct to the house of Gottlieb Groschen, for
purposes only too well to be divined.
“Devil's breeches !” muttered Gottlieb; “look again,
Grete, and see if that hell-troop stop the way outside.”
Margarita's cheeks were overflowing with the offended
rose.
“I will not look at them again, father.”
Gottlieb stared, and then patted her.
“I would I were a man, father!”
Gottlieb smiled, and stroked his beard.
“Oh! how I burn !”
And the girl shivered visibly.
“Grete! mind to be as much of a woman as you can, and
soon such raff as this you may sweep away, like cobwebs,
and no harm done."
He was startled by a violent thumping at the street-door,
and as brazen a blast as if the dead were being summoned.
Aunt Lisbeth entered, and flitted duskily round the room,
crying:
“We are lost : they are upon us ! better death with a
bodkin! Never shall it be said of me; never! the
monsters !"
Then admonishing them to lock, bar, bolt, and block up
every room in the house, Aunt Lisbeth perched herself des-
perately on the edge of a chair, and reversed the habits of
the screech-owl, by being silent when stationary.
“There's nothing to fear for you, Lisbeth,” said Gottlieb,
with discourteous emphasis.
“ Gottlieb ! do you remember what happened at the siege of

Mainz ? and poor Marthe Herbstblum, who had hoped to die
as she was; and Dame Altknöpfchen, and Frau Kaltblut,
and the old baker, Hans Topf's sister, all of them as holy as
abbesses, and that did not save them ! and nothing will from
such godless, virgin-hunting devourers.”
Gottlieb was gone, having often before heard mention of
the calamity experienced by these fated women.
“Comfort thee, good heart, on my breast,” said Margarita,
taking Lisbeth to that sweet nest of peace and fortitude.
"Margarita ! 'tis your doing ! have I not said—lure them
not, for they swarm too early upon us! And here they are !
and, perhaps, in five minutes all will be over! Herr Je !-
What, you are laughing! Heavens of goodness, the girl is
delighted !"
Here a mocking ha-ha! accompanied by a thundering
smack at the door, shook the whole house, and again the
trumpet burst the ears with fury.
This summons, which seemed to Aunt Lisbeth final,
wrought a strange composure in her countenance. She was
very pale, but spread her dress decently, as if fear had
departed, and clasped her hands on her knees.
“The will of the Lord above must be done,” said she ;
“it is impious to complain when we are given into the hand
of the Philistines. Others have been martyred, and were
yet acceptable.”
To this heroic speech she added, with cold energy : “Let
them come!”
“Aunt,” cried Margarita, “I hear my father's voice with
those men. Aunty! I will not let him be alone. I must
go down to him. You will be safe here. I shall come to
you if there's cause for alarm."
And in spite of Aunt Lisbeth's astonished shrieks of
remonstrance, she hurried off to rejoin Gottlieb.

ERE Margarita had reached the landing of the stairs, she
repented her haste and shrank back. Wrapt in a thunder of
oaths, she distinguished : “ 'Tis the little maiden we want;
let's salute her and begone ! or cap your skull with some-
thing thicker than you've on it now, if you want a whole
one, happy father !”
“Gottlieb von Groschen I am," answered her father,
" and the Kaiser-_"
“'S as fond of a pretty girl as we are! Down with her,
and no more drivelling! It's only for a moment, old
Measure and Scales !”
"I tell you, rascals, I know your master, and if you're not
punished for this, may I die a beggar !” exclaimed Gottlieb,
jumping with rage.
“ May you die as rich as an abbot! And so you will, if
you don't bring her down, for I've sworn to see her; there's
the end of it, man !”
“I'll see, too, if the laws allow this villany !” cried
Gottlieb. “Insulting a peaceful citizen ! in his own house
a friend of your emperor ! Gottlieb von Groschen!”
“Groschen ? We're cousins, then ! You wouldn't shut
out your nearest kin? Devil's lightning! Don't you know
me? Pfennig? Von Pfennig! This here's Heller: that's
Zwanziger : all of us Vons, every soul! You're not decided ?
This'll sharpen you, my jolly King Paunch !”

And Margarita heard the ruffian step as if to get swing for
a blow. She hurried into the passage, and slipping in front
of her father, said to his assailant:
“You have asked for me! I am here !”
Her face was colourless, and her voice seemed to issue from
between a tightened cord. She stood with her left foot a
little in advance, and her whole body heaving and quivering:
her arms folded and pressed hard below her bosom : her eyes
dilated to a strong blue: her mouth ashy white. A strange
lustre, as of suppressed internal fire, flickered over her.
“My name's Schwartz Thier, and so's my nature !” said
the fellow with a grin ; “ but may I never smack lips with a
pretty girl again, if I harm such a young beauty as this !
Friendly dealing's my plan o' life.”
“Clear out of my house, then, fellow, and here's money
for you," said Gottlieb, displaying a wrathfully-trembling
handful of coin.
“Pish! money! forty times that wouldn't cover my bet !
And if it did ? Shouldn't I be disgraced ? jeered at for å
sheep-heart ? No! I'm no ninny, and not to be diddled.
I'll talk to the young lady Silence, out there ! all's

my beautiful maiden ! thus it stands: We saw you at the
window, looking like a fresh rose with a gold crown on.
Here are we poor fellows come to welcome the Kaiser. I
began to glorify you. "Schwartz Thier!' says Henker
Rothhals to me, ' I'll wager you odds you don't have a kiss
of that fine girl within twenty minutes, counting from
the hand-smack 1' Done! was my word, and we clapped
our fists together. Now, you see, that's straightforward !
All I want is, not to lose my money and be made a fool of
leaving alone that sugary mouth which makes mine water;"
and he drew the back of his hand along his stubbled jaws :
“So, come ! don't hesitate ! no harm to you, my beauty, but
a compliment, and Schwartz Thier's your friend and anything
else you like for ever after. Come, time's up pretty well.”

Margarita leaned to her father a moment as if mortal
sickness had seized her. Then cramping her hands and
feet, she said in his ear, “Leave me to my own care; go,
get the men to protect thee ;” and ordered Schwartz Thier
to open the door wide.
Seeing Gottlieb would not leave her, she joined her
hands, and begged him. “The good God will protect me!
I will overmatch these men. Look, my father ! they dare
not strike me in the street : you they would fell without
pity. Go! what they dare in a house, they dare not in the
street."
Schwartz Thier had opened the door. At sight of
Margarita, the troop gave a shout.
“Now! on the door-step, full in view, my beauteous
one! that they may see what a lucky devil I am—and have
no doubts about the handing over."
Margarita looked behind. Gottlieb was still there, every
member of him quaking like a bog under a heavy heel. She
ran to him. “My father! I have a device ! wilt thou spoil
it, and give me to this beast? You can do nothing, nothing!
protect yourself and save me !”
“ Cologne ! broad day!” muttered Gottlieb, as if the
enormity had prostrated his belief in facts; and moved
slowly back.
Margarita strode to the door-step. Schwartz Thier was
awaiting her, his arm circled out, and his leering face
ducked to a level with his victim's. This rough show
of gallantry proved costly to him. As he was gently closing
his iron hold about her, enjoying beforehand with grim
mouthridges the flatteries of triumph, Margarita shot past
him through the door, and was already twenty paces beyond
the troop before either of them thought of pursuing her. At
the first sound of a hoof, Henker Rothhals seized the rider's
bridle-rein, and roared : “Fair play for a fair bet ! leave all
to the Thier!”
The Thier, when he had recovered from his amazement,

sought for old Gottlieb to give him a back-hit, as Margarita
foresaw that he would. Not finding him at hand, out
lumbered the fellow as swiftly as his harness would allow,
and caught a glimpse of Margarita rapidly fleeting up the
cathedral square.
“Only five minutes, Schwartz Thier!” some of the
troop sung out.
“The devil can do his business in one,” rang the retort,
and Schwartz Thier swung himself on his broad-backed
charger, and gored the fine beast till she rattled out a blast
of sparkles from the flint.
In a minute he drew up in front of Margarita.
“So! you prefer settling this business in the square.
Good ! my choice sweetheart !” and he sprang to her side.
The act of flight had touched the young girl's heart with
the spirit of flight. She crouched like a winded hare under
the nose of the hound, and covered her face with her two
hands. Margarita was no wisp in weight, but Schwartz
Thier had her aloft in his arm as easily as if he had tossed
up a kerchief.
“Look all, and witness !" he shouted, lifting the other arm.
Henker Rothhals and the rest of the troop looked, as they
came trotting to the scene, with the coolness of umpires :
but they witnessed something other than what Schwartz
Thier proposed. This was the sight of a formidable staff,
whirling an unfriendly halo over the head of the Thier, and
descending on it with such honest intent to confound and
overthrow him, that the Thier succumbed to its force without
argument, and the square echoed blow and fall simultaneously.
At the same time the wielder of this sound piece of logic
seized Margarita, and raised a shout in the square for all true
men to stand by him in rescuing a maiden from the clutch of
brigands and ravishers. A crowd was collecting, but seemed
to consider the circle now formed by the horsemen as in a
manner charmed, for only one, a fair slender youth, came
forward and ranged himself beside the stranger.


## p. 317 (#331) ############################################

THE WAGER.

“ Take thou the maiden: I'll keep to the staff,” said this
latter, stumbling over his speech as if he was in a foreign
land among old roots and wolfpits which had already shaken
out a few of his teeth, and made him cautious about the re-
mainder.
“Can it be Margarita !” exclaimed the youth, bending to
her, and calling to her: “Margarita ! Fräulein Groschen!”
She opened her eyes, shuddered, and said : “I was not
afraid ! Am I safe?”
“Safe while I have life, and this good friend."
“Where is my father ?”
“I have not seen him.”
“And you—who are you? Do I owe this to you ? ”
“Oh! no! no! Me you owe nothing."
Margarita gazed hurriedly round, and at her feet there lay
the Thier with his steel-cap shining in dints, and three
rivulets of blood coursing down his mottled forehead. She
looked again at the youth, and a blush of recognition gave
life to her cheeks.
“I did not know you. Pardon me. Farina! what
thanks can reward such courage ! Tell me ! shall we go ?”
The youth eyed her an instant as if he would have asked
why Paradise was to be so quickly forsaken; but recovering
himself, took a rapid survey, and called to the stranger to
follow and help give the young maiden safe conduct home.
Just then Henker Rothhals bellowed, “ Time's up !" He
was answered by a chorus of agreement from the troop.
They had hitherto patiently acted their parts as spectators,
immovable on their horses. The assault on the Thier was all
in the play, and a visible interference of fortune in favour of
Henker Rothbals. Now general commotion shuttled them,
and the stranger's keen hazel eyes read their intentions
rightly when he lifted his redoubtable staff in preparation for
another mighty swoop, this time defensive. Rothbals, and
half-a-dozen others, with a war-cry of curses, spurred their
steeds at once to ride him down. They had not reckoned

the length and good-will of their antagonist's weapon.
Scarce were they in motion, when round it whizzed, grazing
the nostrils of their horses with a precision that argued
practice in the feat, and unhorsing two, Rothhals among the
number. He dropped heavily on his head, and showed signs
of being as incapable of combat as the Thier. A cheer burst
from the crowd, but fell short. The foremost of their
number was struck flat to the earth by a fellow of the troop.
Calling on St. George, his patron saint, the stranger
began systematically to make a clear ring in his path forward.
Several of the horsemen essayed a cut at his arm with their
long double-handed swords, but the horses could not be
brought a second time to the edge of the magic circle ; and
the blood of these warriors being thoroughly up, they now
came at him on foot. In their rage they would have made
short work with the three, in spite of the magistracy of
Cologne, had they not been arrested by cries of “ Werner !
Werner !"
At the south-west end of the square, looking Rhine-
wards, rode the marauder Baron, in full armour, helm and
hauberk, with a single retainer in his rear. He had appa-
rently caught sight of the brawl, and, either because he
distinguished his own men, or was seeking his natural
element, hastened up for his share in it, which was usually
that of the king of beasts. His first call was for Schwartz
Thier. The men made way, and he beheld his man in no
condition to make military responses. He shouted for
Henker Rothhals, and again the men opened their ranks
mutely, exhibiting the two betters stretched out in diverse
directions, with their feet slanting to a common point. The
Baron glared; then caught off his mailed glove, and thrust
it between his teeth. A rasping gurgle of oaths was all they
heard, and presently surged up,-
“ Who was it?”
Margarita's eyes were shut. She opened them fascinated
with horror. There was an unearthly awful and comic

mixture of sounds in Werner's querulous fury, that was like
the noise of a complaining bear, rolling up from hollow-
chested menace to yawning lament. Never in her life had
Margarita such a shock of fear. The half gasp of a laugh
broke on her trembling lips. She stared at Werner, and
was falling; but Farina's arm clung instantly round her
waist. The stranger caught up her laugh, loud and hearty.
“As for who did it, Sir Baron,” he cried, in a cheery
tone, “I am the man! As you may like to know why-and
that's due to you and me both of us—all I can say is, the
Black Muzzle yonder lying got his settler for merry-making
with this peaceful maiden here, without her consent-an
offence in my green island they reckon a crack o' the sconce
light basting for, I warrant all company present," and he
nodded sharply about. “As for the other there, who looks
as if a rope had been round his neck once and shirked its
duty, he counts his wages for helping the devil in his busi-
ness, as will any other lad here who likes to come on and
try.”
Werner himself, probably, would have given him the
work he wanted ; but his eye had sidled a moment over
Margarita, and the hardly-suppressed applause of the crowd
at the stranger's speech failed to bring his ire into action
this solitary time.
“Who is the maiden ?” he asked aloud.
“ Fräulein von Groschen," replied Farina.
“Von Groschen! Von Groschen ! the daughter of Gottlieb
Groschen ?—Rascals !” roared the Baron, turning on his men,
and out poured a mud-spring of filthy oaths and threats,
which caused Henker Rothhals, who had opened his eyes, to
close them again, as if he had already gone to the place of
heat.
“ Only lend me thy staff, friend,” cried Werner.
“Not I! thwack 'em with your own wood," replied the
stranger, and fell back a leg.
Werner knotted his stringy brows, and seemed torn to

pieces with the different pulling (tides of his wrath. He
grasped the mane of his horse and flung abroad handfuls,
till the splendid animal reared in agony.
“You shall none of you live over this night, villains !
I'll hang you, every hag's son! My last orders were,—Keep
quiet in the city, ye devil's brood. Take that! and that!”
laying at them with his bare sword. “Off with you, and
carry these two pigs out of sight quickly, or I'll have their
heads, and make sure o' them.”
The latter injunction sprang from policy, for at the head
of the chief street there was a glitter of the city guard,
marching with shouldered spears.
“Maiden,” said Werner, with a bull's bow, “let me
conduct thee to thy father."
Margarita did not reply; but gave her hand to Farina,
and took a step closer to the stranger.
Werner's brows grew black with blood.
“Enough to have saved you, fair maid,” he muttered,
hoarsely. “Gratitude never was a woman's gift. Say to
your father that I shall make excuses to him for the conduct
of my men.”
Whereupon, casting a look of leisurely scorn towards the
guard coming up in the last beams of day, the Baron
shrugged his huge shoulders to an altitude expressing the
various conteniptuous shades of feudal coxcom bry, stuck one
leather-ruffled arm in his side, and jolted off at an easy pace.
“ Amen !” ejaculated the stranger, leaning on his staff.
" There are Barons in my old land ; but never a brute beast
in harness."
Margarita stood before him, and took his two hands.
“You will come with me to my father! He will thank
you. I cannot. You will come?”
Tears and a sob of relief started from her.
The city guard, on seeing Werner's redoubtable back
turned, had adopted double time, and now came panting up,
while the stranger bent smiling under a fresh overflow of

innocent caresses. Margarita was caught to her father's
breast.
“You shall have vengeance for this, sweet chuck,” cried
old Gottlieb in the intervals of his hugs.
"Fear not, my father; they are punished : " and Margarita
related the story of the stranger's prowess, elevating him
into a second Siegfried. The guard huzzaed him, but did
not pursue the Baron.
Old Gottlieb, without hesitation, saluted the astonished
champion with a kiss on either cheek.
“My best friend ! You have saved my daughter from
indignity! Come with us home, if you can believe that a
home where the wolves come daring us, dragging our dear
ones from our very doorsteps. Come, that we may thank
you under a roof at least. My little daughter! Is she not
a brave lass ?”
“She's nothing less than the white rose of Germany,”
said the stranger, with a good bend of the shoulders to
Margarita.
"So she's called,” exclaimed Gottlieb; "she's worthy to
be a man!"
“Men would be the losers, then, more than they could
afford,” replied the stranger, with a ringing laugh.
“Come, good friend,” said Gottlieb; "you must need
refreshment. Prove you are a true hero by your appetite.
As Charles the Great said to Archbishop Turpin, 'I
conquered the world because Nature gave me a gizzard ; for
everywhere the badge of subjection is a poor stomach.'
Come, all! A day well ended, notwithstanding !"


## p. 322 (#336) ############################################

THE SILVER ARROW.
At the threshold of Gottlieb's house a number of the chief
burgesses of Cologne had corporated spontaneously to condole
with him. As he came near, they raised a hubbub of gratu-
lation. Strong were the expressions of abhorrence and dis-
gust of Werner's troop in which these excellent citizens
clothed their outraged feelings; for the insult to Gottlieb
was the insult of all. The Rhine-stream taxes were pro-
voking enough to endure ; but that the licence of these free-
booting bands should extend to the homes of free and peaceful
men, loyal subjects of the Emperor, was a sign that the evil
had reached from pricks to pokes, as the saying went, and
must now be met as became burgesses of ancient Cologne,
and by joint action destroyed.
“ In ! in, all of you !” said Gottlieb, broadening his smile
to suit the many. “We'll talk about that in-doors. Mean-
time, I've got a hero to introduce to you: flesh and blood !

to whisper something to Farina, bringing sun and cloud over
his countenance in rapid flushes. He seemed to remonstrate
in dumb show; but she, with an attitude of silence, signified
her wish to seal the conversation, and he drooped again. On
the doorstep she paused a moment, and hung her head pen-
sively, as if moved by a reminiscence. The youth had burried
away some strides. Margarita looked after him. His arms
were straightened to his flanks, his hands clenched, and
straining out from the wrist. He had the aspect of one
tugging against the restraint of a chain that sullenly let out
link by link to his whole force.
“Farina !” she called ; and wound him back with a run.
“ Farina! You do not think me ungrateful ? I could not
tell my father in the crowd what you did for me. He shall
know. He will thank you. He does not understand you
now, Farina. He will. Look not so sorrowful. So much
I would say to you.”
So much was rushing on her mind, that her maidenly heart
became unruly, and warned her to beware.
The youth stood as if listening to a nightingale of the old
woods, after the first sweet stress of her voice was in his ear.
When she ceased, he gazed into her eyes. They were no
longer deep and calm like forest lakes; the tender-glowing
blue quivered, as with a spark of the young girl's soul, in the
beams of the moon then rising.
“Oh, Margarita !” said the youth, in tones that sank to
sighs : “what am I to win your thanks, though it were my
life for such a boon !”.
He took her hand, and she did not withdraw it. Twice
his lips dwelt upon those pure fingers.
“Margarita: you forgive me? I have been so long without
hope. I have kissed your hand, dearest of God's angels ! ”
She gently restrained the full white hand in his pressure.
“Margarita ! I have thought never before death to have
had this sacred bliss. I am guerdoned in advance for every
grief coming before death."

FARINA.
She dropped on him one look of a confiding softness that
was to the youth like the opened gate of the innocent garden
of her heart.
“You pardon me, Margarita ? I may call you my beloved ?
strive, wait, pray, hope, for you, my star of life ? ”
Her face was so sweet a charity !
“Dear love ! one word !—or say nothing, but remain, and
move not. So beautiful you are ! Oh, might I kneel to you
here; dote on you; worship this white hand for ever.”
The colour had passed out of her cheeks like a blissful
western red leaving rich paleness in the sky; and with her
clear brows levelled at him, her bosom lifting more and more
rapidly, she struggled against the charm that was on her,
and at last released her hand.
"I must go. I cannot stay. Pardon you? Who might
not be proud of your love !—Farewell !”
She turned to move away, but lingered a step from him,
hastily touching her bosom and either hand, as if to feel for
a brooch or a ring. Then she blushed, drew the silver arrow
from the gathered gold-shot braids above her neck, held it
out to him, and was gone.
Farina clutched the treasure, and reeled into the street.
Half-a-dozen neighbours were grouped by the door.
“ What's the matter in Master Groschen's house now?"
one asked, as he plunged into the midst of them. .
“ Matter? ” quoth the joy-drunken youth, catching at the
word, and mused off into raptures ; “ There never was such
happiness! 'Tis paradise within, exile without. But what ·
exile! A star ever in the heavens to lighten the road and
cheer the path of the banished one ;” and he loosened his
vest and hugged the cold shaft on his breast.
“What are you talking and capering at, fellow !” ex-
claimed another: “Can't you answer about those shrieks,
like a Christian, you that have just come out of the house?
Why, there's shrieking now! It's a woman. Thousand

... The are the other the house ineare che
thunders! it sounds like the Frau Lisbeth's voice. What
can be happening to her?”.
“Perhaps she's on fire,” was coolly suggested between
two or three.
“Pity to see the old house burnt," remarked one.
“House! The woman, man! the old woman!”
“Ah !” replied the other, an ancient inhabitant of
Cologne, shaking his head, "the house is oldest !”
Farina, now recovering his senses, heard shrieks that he
recognized as possible in the case of Aunt Lisbeth dreading
the wickedness of an opposing sex, and alarmed by the
inrush of old Gottlieb's numerous guests. To confirm him,
she soon appeared, and hung herself halfway out of one of
the upper windows, calling desperately to St. Ursula for
aid. He thanked the old lady in his heart for giving him a
pretext to enter Paradise again; but before even love could
speed him, Frau Lisbeth was seized and dragged remorse-
lessly out of sight, and he and the rosy room darkened
together.
For some time the people loitered about in expectation of
a new excitement. Whistling urchins, and a sprinkling
of graver folk came to inspect the place, where it was
bruited that old Gottlieb had been wounded by one of Baron
Werner's band in the morning. They discovered the pool
of blood, and separated with tidings that Gottlieb was
thought to die at the midnight hour; which sent another
body of anxious investigators, who reported in addition that
the Fräulein Margarita had pitched head foremost out of
window, because of her mad love for the robber Baron
Werner. Erelong the house was believed to be burnt to the
ground, and all within suffocated: not before a terrible
misfortune had befallen the Frau Lisbeth Groschen, the
nature of which was hinted by those significant upliftings of
hands and eyes which are the language of the dread
unmentionable.

FARINA.
Farina twice strode off to the Rhine-stream, impatient of
the folly that waylaid him for strict accounts of these
calamities. As many times he returned. It was hard to be
away from her. It was harder to be near and not close.
His heart flamed into jealousy of the stranger. Everything
threatened to overturn his slight but lofty structure of bliss
so suddenly shot into the heavens. He had but to remember
that his hand was on the silver arrow, and a radiance broke
upon his countenance, and a calm fell upon his breast. “It
was a plight of her troth to me," mused the youth. “She
loves me! She would not trust her frank heart to speak.
Oh, generous young girl ! what am I to dare hope for such a
prize? for I never can be worthy. And she is one who,
giving her heart, gives it all. Do I not know her? How
lovely she looked thanking the stranger! The blue of her
eyes, the warm-lighted blue, seemed to grow full on the
closing lids, like heaven's gratitude. Her beauty is wonder-
ful. What wonder, then, if he loves her? I should think
him a squire in his degree. There are squires of high birth
and low."
So mused Farina with his arms folded and his legs crossed
in the shadow of Margarita’s chamber. Gradually he fell
into a kind of hazy doze. The houses became branded with
silver arrows. All up the Cathedral stone was a glitter, and
dance, and quiver of them. In the sky mazed confusion of
arrowy flights and falls. Farina beheld himself in the service
of the Emperor watching these signs, and expecting on the
morrow to win glory and a name for Margarita. Glory and
the name now won, old Gottlieb was just on the point of
paternally blessing them, when a rude pat aroused him from
the delicious moon-dream.
"Hero by day! house-guard by night! That tells a tale,"
said a cheerful voice.
The moon was shining down the Cathedral square and
street, and Farina saw the stranger standing solid and ruddy
before him. He was at first prompted to resent such familiar

327
handling, but the stranger's face was of that bland honest
nature which, like the sun, wins everywhere back a reflection
of its own kindliness.
“You are right," replied Farina ; " so it is !"
"Pretty wines inside there, and a rare young maiden, eh?
She has a throat like a nightingale, and more ballads at
command than a piper's wallet. Now, if I hadn't a wife at
home "
“You're married ?" cried Farina, seizing the stranger's
hand.
“Surely; and my lass can say something for herself on
the score of brave looks, as well as the best of your Germain
maids here, trust me.”
Farina repressed an inclination to perform a few of those
antics which violent joy excites, and after rushing away and
back, determined to give his secret to the stranger.
“Look,” said he in a whisper, that opens the private doors
of a confidence.
But the stranger repeated the same word still more
earnestly, and brought Farina's eyes on a couple of dark
figures moving under the Cathedral.
"Some lamb's at stake when the wolves are prowling," he
added : “ 'Tis now two hours to the midnight. I doubt if
our day's work be over till we hear the chime, friend." .
“ What interest do you take in the people of this house
that you watch over them thus ?" asked Farina.
The stranger muffled a laugh in his beard.
“An odd question, good sooth. Why, in the first place,
we like well whatso we have done good work for. That
goes for something. In the second, I've broken bread in this
house. Put down that in the reckoning. In the third ;
well! in the third, add up all together, and the sum total's
at your service, young sir."
Farina marked him closely. There was not a spot on his
face for guile to lurk in, or suspicion to fasten on. He caught
the stranger's hand.

FARINA,
“You called me friend just now. Make me your friend.
Look, I was going to say: I love this maiden! I would die
for her. I have loved her long. This night she has given
me'a witness that my love is not vain. I am poor. She is
rich. I am poor, I said, and feel richer than the Kaiser with
this she has given me! Look, it is what our German girls
slide in their back-hair, this silver arrow!”
“A very pretty piece of heathenish wear !” exclaimed the
stranger.
“Then, I was going to say—tell me, friend, of a way to
win honour and wealth quickly; I care not at how rare a risk.
Only to wealth, or high baronry, will her father give her!”
The stranger buzzed his moustache in a pause of cool pity,
such as elders assume when young men talk of conquering
the world for their mistresses : and in truth it is a calm of
mind well won !
“ Things look so brisk at home here in the matter of the
maiden, that I should say, wait a while and watch your
chance. But you're a boy of pluck: I serve in the Kaiser's
army, under my lord : the Kaiser will be here in three days.
If you're of that mind then, I doubt little you may get.
posted well : but, look again ! there's a ripe brew yonder.
Marry, you may win your spurs this night even; who
knows?—'S life! there's a tall fellow joining those two
lurkers."
“Can you see into the murk shadow, Sir Squire ?"
“Ay! thanks to your Styrian dungeons, where I passed
a year's apprenticeship:
'I learnt to watch the rats and mice
At play, with never a candle-end
They play'd so well; they sang so nice;
They dubb'd me comrade; call'd me friend !!
So says the ballad of our red-beard king's captivity. All
evil has a good :

Poison plants make the sweetest oop :'

as the old wives mumble to us when we're sick. Heigho !
would I were in the little island well home again, though
that were just their song of welcome to me, as I am a
Christian.”
“Tell me your name, friend,” said Farina.
“Guy's my name, young man: Goshawk's my title. Guy
the Goshawk! so they called me in my merry land. The
cap sticks when it no longer fits. Then I drove the arrow,
and was down on my enemy ere he could ruffle a feather.
Now, what would be my nickname?
'A change so sad, and a change so bad,
Might set both Christian and heathen a sighing :
Change is a curse, for it's all for the worse :
Age creeps up, and youth is flying!!
and so on, with the old song. But here am I, and yonder's
a game that wants harrying; so we'll just begin to nose about
them a bit.”
He crossed to the other side of the street, and Farina
followed out of the moonlight. The two figures and the
taller one were evidently observing them; for they also
.changed their position and passed behind an angle of the
Cathedral.
“Tell me how the streets cross all round the Cathedral;
you know the city,” said the stranger, holding out his
hand.
Farina traced with his finger a rough map of the streets
on the stranger's hand.
“Good! that's how my lord always marks the battle-
field, and makes me show him the enemy's posts. Forward,
this way !"
He turned from the Cathedral, and both slid along close
under the eaves and front hangings of the houses. Neither
spoke. Farina felt that he was in the hands of a skilful
captain, and only regretted the want of a weapon to make
harvest of the intended surprise ; for he judged clearly that
those were fellows of Werner's band on the look-out. They

wound down numberless intersections of narrow streets with
irregular-built houses standing or leaning wry-faced in row,
here a quaint-beamed cottage, there almost a mansion with
gilt arms, brackets, and devices. Oil-lamps unlit hung at
intervals by the corners, near a pale Christ on crucifix.
Across the passages they hung alight. The passages and
alleys were too dusky and close for the moon in her brightest
ardour to penetrate ; down the streets a slender lane of white
beams could steal: “In all conscience," as the good citizens
of Cologne declared, “enough for those heathen hounds and
sons of the sinful who are abroad when God's own blessed
lamp is out." So, when there was a moon, the expense
of oil was saved to the Cologne treasury, thereby satisfying
the virtuous.
After incessant doubling here and there, listening to
footfalls, and themselves eluding a chase which their
suspicious movements aroused, they came upon the Rhine.
A full flood of moonlight burnished the knightly river în
glittering scales, and plates, and rings, as headlong it rolled
seaward on from under crag and banner of old chivalry and
rapine. Both greeted the scene with a burst of pleasure.
The gray mist of flats on the south side glimmered delightful
to their sight, coming from that drowsy crowd and press of
habitations; but the solemn glory of the river, delaying not,
heedless, impassioned-pouring on in some sublime confer-
ence between it and heaven to the great marriage of waters,
deeply shook Farina's enamoured heart. The youth could
not restrain his tears, as if a magic wand had touched him.
He trembled with love; and that delicate bliss which
maiden hope first showers upon us like a silver rain when
she has taken the shape of some young beauty and plighted
us her fair fleeting hand, tenderly embraced him.
As they were emerging into the spaces of the moon, a
cheer from the stranger arrested Farina.
"Seest thou ? on the wharf there ! that is the very one,
the tallest of the three. Lakin ! but we shall have him."

Wrapt in a long cloak, with low pointed cap and feather,
stood the person indicated. He appeared to be meditating
on the flow of the water, unaware of hostile presences, or
quite regardless of them. There was a majesty in his height
and air, which made the advance of the two upon him more
wary and respectful than their first impulse had counselled.
They could not read his features, which were mantled behind
voluminous folds : all save a pair of very strange eyes, that,
even as they gazed directly downward, seemed charged with
restless fiery liquid.
The two were close behind him : Guy the Goshawk
prepared for one of those fatal pounces on the foe that had
won him his title. He consulted Farina mutely, who nodded
readiness; but the instant after, a cry of anguish escaped
from the youth :-
"Lost ! gone ! lost! Where is it? where ! the arrow! The
Silver Arrow! My Margarita !"
Ere the echoes of his voice had ceased lamenting into the
distance, they found themselves alone on the wharf.

THE LILIES OF THE VALLEY.
“He opened like a bat !” said the stranger.
“His shadow was red !” said Farina.
“He was off like an arrow !” said the stranger.
“Oh! pledge of my young love, how could I lose thee !"
exclaimed the youth, and his eyes were misted with tears.
Guy the Goshawk shook his brown locks gravely.
“Bring me a man, and I'll stand up against him, who-
ever he be, like a man; but this fellow has an ill scent and
foreign ways about him, that he has! His eye boils all
down my backbone and tingles at my finger-tips. Jesu,
save us!”
“Save us !” repeated Farina, with the echo of a deadened
soul.
They made the sign of the cross, and purified the place
with holy ejaculations.
“I've seen him at last; grant it be for the last time !
That's my prayer, in the name of the Virgin and Trinity,”
said Guy. “And now let's retrace our steps : perchance
we shall hunt up that bauble of yours, but I'm not fit
for mortal work this night longer.”
Burdened by their black encounter, the two passed
again behind the Cathedral. Farina's hungry glances
devoured each footmark of their track. Where the moon
held no lantern for him, he went on his knees, and groped
for his fost treasure with a miser's eager patience of agony,

drawing his hand slowly over the stony kerb and between
the interstices of the thick-sown flints, like an acute-feeling
worm. Despair grew heavy in his breast. At every
turning he invoked some good new saint to aid him, and
ran over all the propitiations his fancy could suggest and
his religious lore inspire. By-and-by they reached the head
of the street where Margarita dwelt. The moon was dipping
down, and paler, as if touched with a warning of dawn.
Chill sighs from the open land passed through the spaces
of the city. On certain coloured gables and wood-crossed
fronts, the white light lingered; but mostly the houses
were veiled in dusk, and Gottlieb's house was confused in
the twilight with those of his neighbours, notwithstanding
its greater stateliness and the old grandeur of its timbered
bulk. They determined to take up their position there again,
and paced on, Farina with his head below his shoulders, and
Guy nostril in air, as if uneasy in his sense of smell.
On the window-ledge of a fair-fitted domicile stood a
flower-pot, a rude earthen construction in the form of a
river-barge, wherein grew some valley lilies that drooped
their white bells over the sides.
The Goshawk eyed them wistfully.
“I must smell those blessed flowers if I wish to be
saved !” and he stamped wooden resolve with his staff.
Moved by this exclamation, Farina gazed up at them.
“How like a company of maidens they look floating in
the vessel of life !" he said.
Guy curiously inspected Farina and the flower-pot,
shrugged, and, with his comrade's aid, mounted to a level
with it, seized the prize and redescended.
“There,” he cried, between long luxurious sniffs, “that
chases him out of the nostril sooner than aught else, the
breath of a fresh lass-like flower! I was tormented till now
by the reek of the damned rising from under me. This is
heaven's own incense, I think !”
And Guy inhaled the flowers and spake prettily to them.

FARINA.
“They have a melancholy sweetness, friend,” said Farina.
“I think of whispering Fays, and Elf, and Erl, when their
odour steals through me. Do not you?”
“Nay, nor hope to till my wits are clean gone,” was the
Goshawk's reply. “To my mind, 'tis an honest flower, and
could I do good service by the young maiden who there set
it, I should be rendering back good service done ; for if that
flower has not battled the devil in my nose this night, and
beaten him, my head's a medlar!”
“I scarce know whether as a devout Christian I should
listen to that, friend,” Farina mildly remonstrated. “Lilies
are indeed emblems of the saints ; but then they are not
poor flowers of earth, being transfigured, lustrous unfadingly.
Oh, Cross and Passion ! with what silver serenity thy glory
enwraps me, gazing on these fair bells ! I look on the white
sea of the saints. I am enamoured of fleshly anguish and
martyrdom. All beauty is that worn by wan-smiling faces.
wherein Hope sits as a crown on Sorrow, and the pale ebb of
mortal life is the twilight of joy everlasting. Colourless
peace! Oh, my beloved ! So walkest thou for my soul on
the white sea ever at night, clad in the straight fall of thy
spotless virgin linen; bearing in thy hand the lily, and
leaning thy cheek to it, where the human rose is softened to
a milky bloom of red, the espousals of heaven with earth;
over thee, moving with thee, a wreath of sapphire stars, and
the solitude of purity around !”
“Ah!" sighed the Goshawk, dandling his flower-pot; "the
moon gives strokes as well 's the sun. I' faith, moon-struck
and maid-struck in one! He'll be asking for his head soon.
This dash of the monk and the minstrel is a sure sign.
That's their way of loving in this land : they all go mad,
straight off. I never heard such talk.”
Guy accompanied these remarks with a pitiful glance at
his companion.
“Come, Sir Lover ! lend me a help to give back what
we've borrowed to its rightful owner. 'S blood ! but I feel

an appetite. This night-air takes me in the wind like a
battering ram. I thought I had laid in a stout four-and-
twenty hours' stock of Westphalian Wurst at Master
Groschen's supper-table. Good stuff, washed down with
superior Rhine wine ; say your Liebfrauenmilch for my taste;
though, when I first tried it, I grimaced like a Merry-Andrew,
and remembered roast beef and Glo'ster ale in my prayers.”
The Goshawk was in the act of replacing the pot of lilies,
when a blow from a short truncheon, skilfully flung, struck
him on the neck and brought him to the ground. With him
fell the lilies. He glared to the right and left, and grasped
the broken flower-pot for a return missile ; but no enemy was
in view to test his accuracy of aim. The deep-arched door-
ways showed their empty recesses : the windows slept.
“Has that youth played me false ?” thought the discom-
fited squire, as he leaned quietly on his arm. Farina was
nowhere near.
Guy was quickly reassured.
“ By my fay, now ! that's a fine thing ! and a fine fellow !
and a fleet foot! That lad 'll rise! He'll be a squire some
day. Look at him. Bowels of a'Becket ! 'tis a sight! I'd
rather see that, now, than old Groschen's supper-table groaning
with Wurst again, and running a river of Rüdesheimer !
Tussle on ! I'll lend a hand if there's occasion ; but you shall
have the honour, boy, an you can win it."
This crying on of the hound was called forth by a chase up
the street, in which the Goshawk beheld Farina pursue and
capture a stalwart runaway, who refused with all his might
to be brought back, striving every two and three of his tiptoe
steps to turn against the impulse Farina had got on his neck
and nether garments.
“Who'd have thought the lad was so wiry and mettle-
some, with his soft face, blue eyes, and lank locks ? but a
green mead has more in it than many a black mountain.
Hail, and well done! if I could dub you knight, I would :
trust me !" and he shook Farina by the hand.


## p. 336 (#350) ############################################

FARINA.
Farina modestly stood aside, and allowed the Goshawk to
confront his prisoner.
“So, Sir Shy-i'the-dark ! gallant Stick-i'the-back ! Squire
Truncheon, and Knight of the noble order of Quicksilver
Legs ! just take your stand at the distance you were off me
when you discharged this instrument at my head. By'r
lady! I smart a scratch to pay you in coin, and it's lucky
for you the coin is small, or you might reckon on it the same,
trust me. Now, back !”
The Goshawk lunged out with the truncheon, but the
prisoner displayed no hesitation in complying, and fell back
about a space of fifteen yards.
“I suppose he guesses I've never done the stupid trick
before," mused Guy, “or he would not be so sharp."
Observing that Farina had also fallen back in a line as
guard, Guy motioned him to edge off to the right more,
bawling, “Never mind why!”.
“Now," thought Guy, “if I were sure of notching him,
I'd do the speech part first; but as I'm not-throwing
truncheons being no honourable profession anywhere—I'll
reserve that. The rascal don't quail. We'll see how long
he stands firm."
The Goshawk cleared his wrist, fixed his eye, and swung
the truncheon meditatively to and fro by one end. He
then launched off the shoulder a mighty down-fling, calmly,
watching it strike the prisoner to earth, like an ox under
the hammer.
“ A hit !” said he, and smoothed his wrist.
Farina knelt by the body, and lifted the head on his
breast. “Berthold ! Berthold !” he cried ; “no further
harm shall hap to you, man! Speak!”
“You ken the scapegrace ?” said Guy, sauntering up.
-Tis Berthold Schmidt, son of old Schmidt, the great
goldsmith of Cologne."
“St. Dunstan was not at his elbow this time !"
“A rival of mine," whispered Farina.

“Oho!" and the Goshawk wound a low hiss at his
tongue's tip. “Well! as I should have spoken if his ears
had been open : Justice struck the blow; and a gentle one.
This comes of taking a flying shot, and not standing up
fair. And that seems all that can be said. Where lives
he?"
Farina pointed to the house of the Lilies.
“Beshrew me! the dog has some right on his side.
Whew! yonder he lives ? He took us for some night-
prowlers. Why not come up fairly, and ask my business ?
Smelling a flower is not worth a broken neck, nor defending
your premises quite deserving a hole in the pate. Now, my
lad, you see what comes of dealing with cut and run blows ;
and let this be a warning to you.”
They took the body by head and feet, and laid him at
the door of his father's house. Here the colour came to his
cheek, and they wiped off the streaks of blood that stained
him. Guy proved he could be tender with a fallen foe, and
Farina with an ill-fated rival. It was who could suggest
the soundest remedies, or easiest postures. One lent a
kerchief and nursed him ; another ran to the city fountain
and fetched him water. Meantime the moon had dropped,
and morning, gray and beamless, looked on the house-peaks
and along the streets with steadier eye. They now both
discerned a body of men, far down, fronting Gottlieb's house,
and drawn up in some degree of order. All their charity
forsook them at once.
“Possess thyself of the truncheon,” said Guy: “You see
it can damage. More work before breakfast, and a fine
account I must give of myself to my hostess of the Three
Holy Kings !"
Farina recovered the destructive little instrument.
“I am ready,” said he. “But hark! there's little work
for us there, I fancy. Those be lads of Cologne, no grunters
of the wild. 'Tis the White Rose Club. Always too late
for service.”

FARINA.
Voices singing a hunting glee, popular in that age, swelled
up the clear morning air; and gradually the words became
distinct.
The Kaiser went a-hunting,
A-hunting, tra-ra :
With his bugle-horn at springing morn,
The Kaiser trampled bud and thorn :
| Tra-ra !
And the dew shakes green as the horsemen rear,
And a thousand feathers they flutter with fear;
And a pang drives quick to the heart of the deer;
For the Kaiser's out a-hunting,
| Tra-ra!
Ta, ta, ta, ta,
Tra-ra, tra-ra,
Ta-ta, tra-ra, tra-ra !
The owner of the truncheon awoke to these reviving tones,
and uttered a faint responsive “ Tra-ra !"
“Hark again !” said Farina, in reply to the commendation
of the Goshawk, whose face was dimpled over with the
harmony.
The wild boar lay a-grunting,
A-grunting, tra-ra !
And, boom ! comes the Kaiser to hunt up me ?
Or, queak! the small birdie that hops on the tree ?
Tra-ra!
O birdie, and boar, and deer, lie tame!
For a maiden in bloom, or a full-blown dame,
Are the daintiest prey, and the windingest game,
When Kaisers go a-hunting,
Tra-ra!
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
Tra-ra, tra-ra,
Ha-ha, tra-ra, tra-ra !
The voices held long on the last note, and let it die in a
forest cadence.
"'Fore Gad ! well done. Hurrah ! Tra-ra, ha-ha, tra-ra !
That's a trick we're not half alive to at home," said Guy.
“I feel friendly with these German lads."

The Goshawk's disposition toward German lads was that
moment harshly tested by a smart rap on the shoulder
from an end of German oak, and a proclamation that he was
prisoner of the hand that gave the greeting, in the name of
the White Rose Club. Following that, his staff was wrested
from him by a dozen stout young fellows, who gave him no
time to get his famous distance for defence against numbers ;
and he and Farina were marched forthwith to the chorusing
body in front of Gottlieb Groschen's house.

Of all the inmates, Gottlieb had slept most with the day on
his eyelids, for Werner hung like a nightmare over him.
Margarita lay and dreamed in rose-colour, and if she thrilled
on her pillowed silken couch like a tense-strung harp, and
fretted drowsily in little leaps and starts, it was that a bird
lay in her bosom, panting and singing through the night,
and that he was not to be stilled, but would musically utter
the sweetest secret thoughts of a love-bewitched maiden.
Farina's devotion she knew : his tenderness she divined : his
courage she had that day witnessed. The young girl no
sooner felt that she could love worthily, than she loved with
her whole strength. Muffled and remote came the hunting-
song under her pillow, and awoke dreamy delicate curves
in her fair face, as it thinned but did not banish her dream.
Aunt Lisbeth also heard the song, and burst out of her bed
to see that the door and window were secured against the
wanton Kaiser. Despite her trials, she had taken her spell
of sleep; but being possessed of some mystic maiden belief
that in cases of apprehended peril from man, bed was a rock
of refuge and fortified defence, she crept back there, and
allowed the sun to rise without her. Gottlieb's voice could
not awaken her to the household duties she loved to perform
with such a doleful visage. She heard him open his window,
and parley in angry tones with the musicians below.

“Decoys !” muttered Aunt Lisbeth ; " be thou alive to
them, Gottlieb !”
He went downstairs and opened the street-door, whereupon
the scolding and railing commenced anew.
“Thou hast given them vantage, Gottlieb, brother mine,"
she complained ; "and the Good Heavens only can say what
may result from such indiscreetness."
A silence, combustible with shuffling of feet in the passage
and on the stairs, dinned horrors into Aunt Lisbeth's head.
“It was just that sound in the left wing of Höllenbogen-
blitz,” she said : “only then it was night and not morning.
Ursula preserve me!”
“Why, Lisbeth ! Lisbeth !” cried Gottlieb from below.
“Come down ! 'tis full five o' the morning. Here's company;
and what are we to do without the woman?”.
“Ah, Gottlieb ! that is like men! They do not consider
how different it is for us !” which mysterious sentence being
uttered to herself alone, enjoyed a meaning it would else-
where have been denied.
Aunt Lisbeth dressed, and met Margarita descending.
They exchanged the good-morning of young maiden and
old.
“Go thou first,” said Aunt Lisbeth.
Margarita gaily tripped ahead.
“Girl !” cried Aunt Lisbeth, “what's that thing in thy
back hair ?"
“I have borrowed Lieschen's arrow, aunt. Mine has had
an accident.”
“ Lieschen's arrow! An accident! Now I will see to
that after breakfast, Margarita.”
“Tra-ra, ta-ta, tra-ra, tra-ra,” sang Margarita.
“ The wild boar lay a-grunting,
A-grunting, tra-ra.”
“A maiden's true and proper ornament! Look at mine,
child ! I have worn it fifty years. May I deserve to wear

O Margarita ! trifle not with that

symbol.”
“O birdie, and boar, and deer, lie tame!'
I am so happy, aunty.”
“Nice times to be happy in, Margarita."
“'Be happy in Spring, sweet maidens all,
For Autumn's chill will early fall.'
So sings the Minnesinger, aunty; and
"A maiden in the wintry leaf
Will spread her own disease of grief.'
I love the Minnesingers ! Dear, sweet-mannered men they
are! Such lovers! And men of deeds as well as song:
sword on one side and harp on the other. They fight till set
of sun, and then slacken their armour to waft a ballad to
their beloved by moonlight, covered with stains of battle as
they are, and weary !”
“What a girl ! Minnesingers! Yes; I know stories of
those Minnesingers. They came to Höllenbogenblitz.
Margarita, a bead of thy cross is broken. I will attend to
it. Wear the pearl one till I mend this. May'st thou never
fall in the way of Minnesingers. They are not like Werner's
troop. They do not batter at doors : they slide into the
house like snakes, and before thou’rt aware !"
Aunt Lisbeth crossed herself, and leaned her head
dolorously to the left.
“ Lisbeth ! Lisbeth !” they heard Gottlieb calling impa-
tiently.
“We come, Gottlieb !” and in a low murmur Margarita
heard her say: "May this day pass without trouble and
shame to the pious and the chaste."
Margarita knew the voice of the stranger before she had
opened the door, and on presenting herself, the hero gave
her a guardian-like salute.
“One may see," he said, “that it requires better men

than those of Werner to drive away the rose from that
cheek.”
Gottlieb pressed the rosy cheek to his shoulder and
patted her.
“What do you think, Grete? You have now forty of the
best lads in Cologne enrolled to protect you, and keep
guard over the house night and day. There! What more
could a Pfalzgräfin ask, now? And voluntary service; all
to be paid with a smile, which I dare say my lady won't
refuse them. Lisbeth, you know our friend. Fear him
not, good Lisbeth, and give us breakfast, in the name of
fasting friars ! Well, sweet chuck, you're to have royal
honours paid you. I warrant they've begun good work already
in locking up that idle, moony vagabond, Farina- ”.
“Him? What for, my father? How dared they! What
has he done?”
“O, start not, my fairy maid ! A small matter of breakage,
pet! He tried to enter Cunigonde Schmidt's chamber, and
knocked down her pot of lilies : for which Berthold Schmidt
knocked him down, and our friend here, out of good
fellowship, knocked down Berthold. However, the chief
offender is marched off to prison by your trusty guard, and
there let him cool himself. Berthold shall tell you the tale
himself: he'll be here to breakfast, and receive your orders,
mistress commander-in-chief.”
The Goshawk had his eye on Margarita. Her teeth were
tight down on her nether lip, and her whole figure had a
strange look of awkwardness, she was so divided with anger.
“As witness of the affair, I think I shall make a clearer
statement, fair maiden,” he interposed. “In the first place,
I am the offender. We passed under the window of the
Fräulein Schmidt, and 'twas I mounted to greet the lilies.
One shoot of them is in my helm, and here let me present
them to a worthier holder.”
He offered the flowers with a smile, and Margarita took
them, radiant with gratitude.

FARINA.
“Our friend Berthold,” he continued, “ thought proper to
aim a blow at me behind my back, and then ran for his
comrades. He was caught, and by my gallant young hero,
Farina; concerning whose character I regret that your
respected father and I differ : for, on the faith of a soldier
and true man, he's the finest among the fine fellows I've yet
met in Germany, trust me. So, to cut the story short,
execution was done upon Berthold by my hand, for an act
of treachery. He appears to be a sort of captain of one of
the troops, and not affectionately disposed to Farina ; for the
version of the affair you have heard from your father is a
little invention of Master Berthold's own. To do him
justice, he seemed equally willing to get me under the cold
stone; but a word from your good father changed the
current; and as I thought I could serve our friend better
free than behind bars, I accepted liberty. Pshaw ! I should
have accepted it any way, to tell the truth, for your German
dungeons are mortal shivering ratty places. So rank me no
hero, fair Mistress Margarita, though the temptation to seem
one in such sweet eyes was beginning to lead me astray.
And now, as to our business in the streets at this hour,
believe the best of us.”
"I will ! I do!” said Margarita.
"Lisbeth ! Lisbeth !" called Gottlieb. “Breakfast, little
sister ! our champion is starving. He asks for Wurst, milk-
loaves, wine, and all thy rarest conserves. Haste, then, for
the honour of Cologne is at stake."
Aunt Lisbeth jingled her keys in and out, and soon
that harmony drew a number of domestics with platters of
swine flesh, rolls of white wheaten bread, the perpetual
Wurst, milk, wine, barley-bread, and household stores of
dainties in profusion, all sparkling on silver, relieved by
spotless white cloth. Gottlieb beheld such a sunny twinkle
across the Goshawk's face at this hospitable array, that he
gave the word of onset without waiting for Berthold, and
his guest immediately fell to, and did not relax in his

345
exertions for a full half-hour by the Cathedral clock,
eschewing the beer with a wry look made up of scorn and
ruefulness, and drinking a well-brimmed health in Rhine
wine all round. Margarita was pensive : Aunt Lisbeth on
her guard.. Gottlieb remembered Charles the Great's counsel
to Archbishop Turpin, and did his best to remain on earth
one of its lords dominant.
“Poor Berthold !” said he. “'Tis a good lad, and deserves
his seat at my table oftener. I suppose the flower-pot
business has detained him. We'll drink to him: eh,
Grete?”
“Drink to him, dear father !—but here he is to thank
you in person."
Margarita felt a twinge of pity as Berthold entered. The
livid stains of his bruise deepened about his eyes, and gave
them a wicked light whenever they were fixed intently; but
they looked earnest; and spoke of a combat in which he
could say that he proved no coward and was used with some
cruelty. She turned on the Goshawk a mute reproach ; yet
smiled and loved him well when she beheld him stretch a
hand of welcome and proffer a brotherly glass to Berthold.
The rich goldsmith's son was occupied in studying the horo-
scope of his fortunes in Margarita's eyes; but when Margarita
directed his attention to Guy, he turned to him with a glance
of astonishment that yielded to cordial greeting.
“ Well done, Berthold, my brave boy! All are friends
who sit at table,” said Gottlieb. “In any case, at my table :
""Tis a worthy foe
Forgives the blow
Was dealt him full and fairly,'
says the song; and the proverb takes it up with, “A generous
enemy is a friend on the wrong side ;' and no one's to blame
for that, save old Dame Fortune. So now a bumper to this
jovial make-up between you. Lisbeth! you must drink it."
The little woman bowed melancholy obedience.

·
“Why did you fling and run ?” whispered Guy to
Berthold.
“Because you were two against one."
“Two against one, man! Why, have you no such thing
as fair play in this land of yours ? Did you think I should
have taken advantage of that ?”
“How could I tell who you were, or what you would do ?”
muttered Berthold, somewhat sullenly.
“Truly no, friend! So you ran to make yourself twenty
to two ? But don't be down on the subject. I was going to
say that, though I treated you in a manner upright, 'twas
perhaps, a trifle severe, considering your youth: but an
example's everything; and I must let you know in confi-
dence, that no rascal truncheon had I flung in my life
before ; so, you see, I gave you all the chances.”
Berthold moved his white lips in reply ; but thinking of
the figure of defeat he was exhibiting before Margarita,
caused him to estimate unfavourably what chances had stood
in his favour.
The health was drunk. Aunt Lisbeth touched the smoky
yellow glass with a mincing lip, and beckoned Margarita to
withdraw.
“The tapestry, child !” she said. “Dangerous things are
uttered after the third glass, I know, Margarita."
“Do you call my champion handsome, aunt ?"
“I was going to speak to you about him, Margarita. If
I remember, he has rough, good looks, as far as they go.
Yes : but thou, maiden, art thou thinking of him ? I have
thrice watched him wink; and that, as we know, is a habit
of them that have sold themselves. And what is frail woman-
kind to expect from such a brawny animal ?"
" And oh! to lace his armour up,
And speed him to the field, -
To pledge him in a kissing-cup-
The knight that will not yield!

I am sure he is tender, aunt. Notice how gentle he looks
now and then."
“ Tender! gentle! Thou girl! Yes, I believe she is
madly in love with him. Tender, and gentle! So is the
bear when you're outside his den ; but enter it, maiden, and
try! Thou good Ursula, preserve me from such a fate.”
“Fear not, dear aunt! Have not a fear of it! Besides,
it is not always the men that are bad. You must not forget
Dalilah, and Lot's wife, and Pfalzgräfin Jutta, and the
Baroness who asked for a piece of poor Kraut. But, let us
work, let us work !"
Margarita sat down before Siegfried, and contemplated the
hero. For the first time, she marked a resemblance in his
features to Farina : the same long yellow hair scattered over
his shoulders as that flowing from under Siegfried's helm ;
the blue eyes, square brows, and regular outlines. “This is
a marvel,” thought Margarita. “And Farina! it was to
watch over me that he roamed the street last night, my best
one! Is he not beautiful ?" and she looked closer at
Siegfried.
Aunt Lisbeth had begun upon the dragon with her usual
method, and was soon wandering through skeleton halls of
the old palatial castle in Bohemia. The woolly tongue of the
monster suggested fresh horrors to her, and if Margarita had
listened, she might have had fair excuses to forget her lover's
condition; but her voice only did service like a piece of
terror-stricken clock-work, and her mind was in the prison
with Farina. She was long debating how to win his release;
and meditated so deeply, and exclaimed in so many bursts of
impatience, that Aunt Lisbeth found her heart melting to the
maiden.
“Now," said she," that is a well-known story about the
Electress Dowager of Bavaria, when she came on a visit to
Höllenbogenblitz; and, my dear child, be it a warning.
Terrible, too !” and the little woman shivered pleasantly.

“She had-I may tell you this, Margarita—yes, she had been
false to her wedded husband.—You understand, maiden; or,
no ! you do not understand : I understand it only partly,
mind-false, I say— "
“False—not true : go on, dear aunty," said Margarita,
catching the word.
"I believe she knows as much as I do!” ejaculated Aunt
Lisbeth ; "such are girls nowadays. When I was young-
oh ! for a maiden to know anything then-oh! it was general
reprobation. No one thought of confessing it. We blushed
and held down our eyes at the very idea. Well, the Electress !
she was—you must guess. So she called for her caudle at
eleven o'clock at night. What do you think that was? Well,
there was spirit in it: not to say nutmeg, and lemon, and
peach-kernels. She wanted me to sit with her, but I begged
my mistress to keep me from the naughty woman : and no
friend of Hilda of Bayern was Bertha of Böhmen, you may
be sure. Oh! the things she talked while she was drinking
her caudle. Isentrude sat with her, and said it was fearful !
—beyond blasphemy! and that she looked like a bible
witch, sitting up drinking and swearing and glaring in her
nightclothes and nightcap. She was on a journey into
Hungary, and claimed the hospitality of Höllenbogenblitz on
her way there. Both were widows. Well, it was a quarter
to twelve. The Electress dropped back on her pillow, as
she always did, when she had finished the caudle. Isentrude
covered her over; heaped up logs on the fire ; wrapped her
dressing-gown about her, and prepared to sleep. It was
winter, and the wind howled at the doors, and rattled the
windows, and shook the arras-Lord help us ! Outside was
all snow, and nothing but forest; as you saw when you
came to me there, Gretelchen. Twelve struck. Isentrude
was dozing; but she says that after the last stroke she
woke with cold. A foggy chill hung in the room. She
ooked at the Electress, who had not moved. The fire
burned feebly, and seemed weighed upon : Herr Je !-she

thought she heard a noise. No. Quite quiet! As heaven
preserve her, says she, the smell in that room grew like
an open grave, clammily putrid. Holy Virgin! This time
she was certain she heard a noise ; but it seemed on both
sides of her. There was the great door leading to the first
landing and state-room ; and opposite exactly there was the
panel of the secret passage. The noises seemed to advance
as if step by step, and grew louder in each ear as she stood
horrified on the marble of the hearth. She looked at the
Electress again, and her eyes were wide open ; but for
all Isentrude's calling, she would not wake. Only think !
Now the noise increased, and was a regular tramp-grate,
tramip-screw sound-coming nearer and nearer : Saints of
mercy! The apartment was choking with vapours.
Isentrude made a dart, and robed herself behind a curtain of
the bed just as the two doors opened. She could see
through a slit in the woven work, and winked her eyes-
which she had shut close on hearing the scream of the door-
hinges—winked her eyes to catch a sight for a moment-we
are such sinful, curious creatures :- What she saw then, she
says she shall never forget ; nor I! As she was a living
woman, there she saw the two dead princes, the Prince
Palatine of Bohemia and the Elector of Bavaria, standing
front to front at the foot of the bed, all in white armour,
with drawn swords, and attendants holding pine-torches.
Neither of them spoke. Their vizors were down; but she
knew them by their arms and bearing: both tall, stately
presences, good knights in their day, and had fought against
the Infidel. So one of them pointed to the bed, and then
a torch was lowered, and the fight commenced. Isentrude
saw the sparks fly, and the steel struck till it was shattered ;
but they fought on, not caring for wounds, and snorting
with fury as they grew hotter. They fought a whole hour.
The poor girl was so eaten up with looking on, that she
let go the curtain and stood quite exposed among them. So,
to steady herself, she rested her hand on the bed-side; and

think what she felt—a hand as cold as ice locked hers, and
get from it she could not! That instant one of the princes
fell. It was Böhmen. Bayern sheathed his sword, and
waved his hand, and the attendants took up the slaughtered
ghost, feet and shoulders, and bore him to the door of
the secret passage, while Bayern strode after— "
“Shameful !” exclaimed Margarita. “I will speak to
Berthold as he descends. I hear him coming. He shall do
what I wish.”
“ Call it dreadful, Grete! Dreadful it was. If Berthold
would like to sit and hear-Ah! she is gone. A good girl!
and of a levity only on the surface."
Aunt Lisbeth heard Margarita's voice rapidly addressing
Berthold. His reply was low and brief. “Refuses to listen
to anything of the sort,” Aunt Lisbeth interpreted it. Then
he seemed to be pleading, and Margarita uttering short
answers. “I trust 'tis nothing a maiden should not hear,” the
little lady exclaimed with a sigh. Höllenbogenblitz was strong
in her that morning, and she regarded Margarita as her own.
The door opened, and Lieschen stood at the entrance.
“For Fräulein Margarita,” she said, holding a letter half-
way out.
“Give it," Aunt Lisbeth commanded.
The woman hesitated—“'Tis for the Fräulein."
“Give it, I tell thee !” and Aunt Lisbeth eagerly seized
the missive, and subjected it to the ordeal of touch. It was
heavy, and contained something hard. Long pensive pressures
revealed its shape on the paper. It was an arrow.
“Go!” said she to the woman, and, once alone, began,
bee-like, to buzz all over it, and finally entered, for she was
small. It contained Margarita's Silver Arrow. “The art of
that girl !” And the writing said:
seemed of the sortis low and Voice rapid.
“ SWEETEST MAIDEN !
“By this arrow of our betrothal, I conjure thee to meet
me in all haste without the western gate, where, burning to

paper, now waits, petitioning the saints, thy
"FARINA."
Aunt Lisbeth placed letter and arrow in a draw ; locked it;
and always thought so.” She ascended the stairs to consult
with Gottlieb. Roars of laughter greeted her just as she
lifted the latch, and she retreated abashed. There was no
time to lose. Farina must be caught in the act of waiting for
Margarita, and by Gottlieb, or herself. Gottlieb was revelling.
“May this be a warning to thee, Gottlieb," murmured Lisbeth,
as she hooded her little body in Margarita's fur-cloak, and
determined that she would be the one to confound Farina.
Five minutes later Margarita returned. Aunt Lisbeth was
gone. The dragon still lacked a tip to his forked tongue,
and a stream of fiery threads dangled from the jaws of the
monster. Another letter was brought into the room by
Lieschen.
“For Aunt Lisbeth,” said Margarita, reading the address.
“ Who can it be from ?”
“She does not stand pressing about your letters," said the
woman; and informed Margarita of the foregoing missive.
“ You say she drew an arrow from it?” said Margarita,
with burning face. “Who brought this ? tell me !” and just
waiting to hear it was Farina's mother, she tore the letter
open, and read :-
66 DEAREST LISBETH !
“Thy old friend writes to thee; she that has scarce
left eyes to see the words she writes. Thou knowest we are
a fallen house, through the displeasure of the Emperor on my
dead husband. My son, Farina, is my only stay, and well
returns to me the blessings I bestow upon him. Some call
him idle : some think him too wise. I swear to thee, Lisbeth,
he is only good. His hours are devoted to the extraction of

essences,—to no black magic. Now he is in trouble-in
prison. The shadow that destroyed his dead father threatens
him. Now, by our old friendship, beloved Lisbeth !
intercede with Gottlieb, that he may plead for my own son
before the Emperor when he comes —”
Margarita read no more. She went to the window, and
saw her guard marshalled outside. She threw a kerchief
over her head, and left the house by the garden gate,

THE MONK.
By this time the sun stood high over Cologne. The market-
places were crowded with buyers and sellers, mixed with a
loitering swarm of soldiery, for whose thirsty natures wine-
stalls had been tumbled up. Barons and knights of the
empire, bravely mounted and thickly followed, poured hourly
into Cologne from South Germany and North. Here, staring
Suabians, and round-featured warriors of the East Kingdom,
swaggered up and down, patting what horses came across
them, for lack of occupation for their hands. Yonder, huge
Pomeranians, with bosks of beard stiffened out square from
the chin, hurtled mountainous among the peaceable in-
habitants. Troopers dismounted went straddling, in tight
hose and loose, prepared to drink good-will to whomsoever
would furnish the best quality liquor for that solemn pledge,
and equally ready to pick a quarrel with them that would
not. It was a scene of flaring feathers, wide-flapped bonnets,
flaunting hose, blue and battered steel plates, slashed woollen
haunch-bags, leather-leggings, ensigns, and imperious boots
and shoulders. Margarita was too hurried in her mind to
be conscious of an imprudence; but her limbs trembled, and
she instinctively quickened her steps. When she stood
under the sign of the Three Holy Kings, where dwelt Farina's
mother, she put up a fervent prayer of thanks, and breathed
freely.

“I had expected a message from Lisbeth,” said Frau
Farina; “but thou, good heart ! thou wilt help us ?”
“All that may be done by me I will do," replied Margarita ;
“ but his mother yearns to see him, and I have come to bear
her company."
The old lady clasped her hands and wept.
“Has he found so good a friend, my poor boy! And
trust me, dear maiden, he is not unworthy, for better son
never lived, and good son, good all ! Surely we will go to
him, but not as thou art. I will dress thee. Such throngs
are in the streets : I heard them clattering in early this
morning. Rest, dear heart, till I return.”
Margarita had time to inspect the single sitting-room in
which her lover lived. It was planted with bottles, and
vases, and pipes, and cylinders, piling on floor, chair, and
table. She could not suppress a slight surprise of fear, for
this display showed a dealing with hidden things, and a
summoning of scattered spirits. It was this that made his
brow so pale, and the round of his eye darker than youth
should let it be! She dismissed the feeling, and assumed
her own bright face as Dame Farina reappeared, bearing on
her arm a convent garb, and other apparel. Margarita
suffered herself to be invested in the white and black robes
of the denial of life.
“There !” said the Frau Farina, "and to seal assurance, I
have engaged a guard to accompany us. He was sorely
bruised in a street combat yesterday, and was billeted below,
where I nursed and tended him, and he is grateful, as man
should be—though I did little, doing my utmost-and with
him near us we have nought to fear.”
“Good,” said Margarita, and they kissed and departed.
The guard was awaiting them outside.
“Come, my little lady, and with thee the holy sister !
'Tis no step from here, and I gage to bring ye safe, as sure
as my name's Schwartz Thier!-Hey? The good sister's
dropping. Look, now! I'll carry her.”

THE MONK.
355
Margarita recovered her self-command before he could
make good this offer.
“Only let us basten there,” she gasped.
The Thier strode on, and gave them safe-conduct to the
prison where Farina was confined, being near one of the
outer forts of the city.
“Thank and dismiss him,” whispered Margarita.
“Nay! he will wait-wilt thou not, friend! We shall
not be long, though it is my son I visit here," said Frau
Farina.
“Till to-morrow morning, my little lady! The lion
thanked him that plucked the thorn from his foot, and the
Thier may be black, but he's not ungrateful, nor a worse
beast than the lion.”
They entered the walls and left him.
For the first five minutes Schwartz Thier found employ-
ment for his faculties by staring at the shaky, small-paned
windows of the neighbourhood. He persevered in this, after
all novelty had been exhausted, from an intuitive dread of
weariness. There was nothing to see. An old woman once
bobbed out of an attic, and doused the flints with water,
Harassed by increasing dread of the foul nightmare of nothing-
to-do, the Thier endeavoured to establish amorous intelligence
with her. She responded with an indignant projection of
the under-jaw, evanishing rapidly. There was no resource
left him but to curse her with extreme heartiness. The
Thier stamped his right leg, and then his left, and remem-
bered the old woman as a grievance five minutes longer.
When she was clean forgotten, he yawned. Another spouse
of the moment was wanted, to be wooed, objurgated, and
regretted. The prison-gate was in a secluded street. Few
passengers went by, and those who did edged away from the
ponderous, wanton-eyed figure of lazy mischief lounging
there, as neatly as they well could. The Thier hailed two or
three. One took to his legs, another bowed, smirked, gave
him a kindly good-day, and affected to hear no more, having

urgent business in prospect. The Thier was a faithful dog,
but the temptation to betray his trust and pursue them was
mighty. He began to experience an equal disposition to cry
and roar. He hummed a ballad :--
“I swore of her I'd have my will,
And with him I'd have my way:
I learn'd my cross-bow over the hill :
Now what does my lady say ?
Give me the good old cross-bow, after all, and none of these
umbering puff-and-bangs that knock you down oftener than
your man !
“ A cross stands in the forest still,
And a cross in the churchyard gray :
My curse on him who had his will,
And on him who had his way!
Good beginning, bad ending! 'Tisn't so always. “Many a
cross has the cross-bow built,' they say. I wish I had mine,
now, to peg off that old woman, or somebody. I'd swear
she's peeping at me over the gable, or behind some cranny.
They're curious, the old women, curse 'em! And the
young, for that matter. Devil a young one here.
“When I'm in for the sack of a town,
What, think ye, I poke after, up and down?
Silver and gold I pocket in plenty,
But the sweet tit-bit is my lass under twenty.
I should like to be in for the sack of this Cologne. I'd nose
out that pretty girl I was cheated of yesterday. Take the
gold and silver, and give me the maiden! Her neck's silver,
and her hair gold. Ah ! and her cheeks roses, and her
mouth-say no more! I'm half thinking Werner, the
hungry animal, has cast wolf's eyes on her. They say he
spoke of her last night. Don't let him thwart me.
Thunderblast him ! 'I owe him a grudge. He's beginning
to forget my plan o' life.”

THE MONK.

ahatrahat be pigeons acrosse
A flight of pigeons across the blue top of the street
abstracted the Thier from these reflections. He gaped after
them in despair, and fell to stretching and shaking himself,
rattling his lungs with loud reports. As he threw his eyes
round again, they encountered those of a monk opposite
fastened on him in penetrating silence. The Thier hated
monks as a wild beast shuns fire ; but now even a monk
was welcome.
“Halloo !” he sung out.
The monk crossed over to him.
“Friend !” said he, “weariness is teaching thee wanton-
ness. Wilt thou take service for a night's work, where the
danger is little, the reward lasting ?”
“ As for that,” replied the Thier, “danger comes to me
like greenwood to the deer, and good pay never yet was
given in promises. But I'm bound for the next hour to
womankind within there. They're my masters ; as they've
been of tough fellows before me.”
“I will seek them, and win their consent,” said the monk,
and so left him.
“Quick dealing !” thought the Thier, and grew brisker.
“ The baron won't want me to-night: and what if he does ?
Let him hang himself—tho', if he should, 'twill be a pity
I'm not by to help him.”
He paced under the wall to its farthest course. Turning
back, he perceived the monk at the gateway.
“A sharp hand !” thought the Thier.
“Intrude no question on me,” the monk began ; “ but
hold thy peace and follow : the women release thee, and
gladly.”
“ That's not my plan o' life, now ! Money down, and
then command me:" and Schwartz Thier stood with one
foot forward, and hand stretched out.
A curl of scorn darkened the cold features of the monk.
He slid one hand into a side of his frock above the girdle,
and tossed a bag of coin,

“Take it, if ’tis in thee to forfeit the greater blessing," he
cried contemptuously.
The Thier peeped into the bag, and appeared satisfied.
“I follow,” said he ; " lead on, good father, and I'll be in
the track of holiness for the first time since my mother was
quit of me."
The monk hurried up the street and into the market-place
oblivious of the postures and reverences of the people, who
stopped to stare at him and his gaunt attendant. As they
crossed the square, Schwartz Thier spied Henker Rothhals
starting from a wine-stall on horseback, and could not
forbear hailing him. Before the monk had time to utter
a reproach, they were deep together in a double-shot of query
and reply.
“Whirr !” cried the Thier, breaking on some communica-
tion. “Got her, have they ? and swung her across stream?
I'm one with ye for my share, or call me sheep !”
He waved his hand to the monk, and taking hold of the
horse's rein, ran off beside his mounted confederate, heavily
shod as he was.
The monk frowned after him, and swelled with a hard
sigh.
“Gone!” he exclaimed, “and the accursed gold with
him! Well did a voice warn me that such service was
never to be bought !”
He did not pause to bewail or repent, but returned
toward the prison with rapid footsteps, muttering: “I
with the prison-pass for two; why was I beguiled by that
bandit ? Saw I not the very youth given into my hands
there, he that was with the damsel and the aged woman?”

THE RIDE AND THE RACE.
LATE in the noon a horseman, in the livery of the Kaiser's
body-guard, rode dry and dusty into Cologne, with tidings
that the Kaiser was at Hammerstein Castle, and command-
ing all convocated knights, barons, counts, and princes, to
assemble and prepare for his coming, on a certain bare space
of ground within two leagues of Cologne, thence to swell
the train of his triumphal entry into the ancient city of his
empire.
Guy the Goshawk, broad-set on a Flemish mare, and a
pack-horse beside him, shortly afterward left the hotel of
the Three Holy Kings, and cantered up to Gottlieb's door.
“Tent-pitching is now my trade,” said he, as Gottlieb
came down to him. “My lord is with the Kaiser. I must
say farewell for the nonce. Is the young lady visible?”
“Nor young, nor old, good friend,” replied Gottlieb, with
a countenance somewhat ruffled. “I dined alone for lack
of your company. Secret missives came, I hear, to each of
them, and both are gadding. Now what think you of this,
after the scene of yesterday ?-Lisbeth too !”
“Preaches from the old text, Master Groschen ; 'Never
reckon on womankind for a wise act. But farewell ! and
tell Mistress Margarita that I take it ill of her not giving me
her maiden hand to salute before parting. My gravest
respects to Frau Lisbeth. I shall soon be sitting with you

over that prime vintage of yours, or fortune's dead against
me."
So, with a wring of the hand, Guy put the spur to his
round-flanked beast, and was quickly out of Cologne on the
rough roadway.
He was neither the first nor the last of the men-at-arms
hastening to obey the Kaiser's mandate. A string of horse
and foot in serpentine knots stretched along the flat land,
flashing colours livelier than the spring-meadows bordering
their line of passage. Guy, with a nod for all, and a greeting
for the best-disposed, pushed on toward the van, till the
gathering block compelled him to adopt the snail's pace of
the advance party, and gave him work enough to keep his
two horses from being jammed with the mass. Now and
then he cast a weather-eye on the heavens, and was soon
confirmed in an opinion he had repeatedly ejaculated, that
“the first night's camping would be a drencher.” In the
West a black bank of cloud was blotting out the sun before
his time. North-east shone bare fields of blue lightly touched
with loose-floating strips and flakes of crimson vapour. The
furrows were growing purple-dark, and gradually a low
moaning obscurity enwrapped the whole line, and muffled
the noise of hoof, oath, and waggon-wheel in one sullen
murmur.
Guy felt very much like a chopped worm, as he wriggled
his way onward in the dusk, impelled from the rear, and
reduced to grope after the main body. Frequent and deep
counsel he took with a trusty flask suspended at his belt.
It was no pleasant reflection that the rain would be down be-
fore he could build up anything like shelter for horse and
man. Still sadder the necessity of selecting his post on
strange ground, and in darkness. He kept an anxious look-
out for the moon, and was presently rejoiced to behold a
broad fire that twinkled branchy beams through an east-hill
orchard.
“My lord calls her Goddess,” said Guy, wistfully. “The

title's outlandish, and more the style of these foreigners : but
she may have it to night, an she'll just keep the storm from
shrouding her bright eye a matter of two hours."
She rose with a boding lustre. Drifts of thin pale upper-
cloud leaned down ladders, pure as virgin silver, for her to
climb to her highest seat on the unrebellious half-circle of
heaven.
“My mind's made up!” quoth Guy to the listening part
of himself. “Out of this I'll get.”
By the clearer ray he had discerned a narrow track running
a white parallel with the general route. At the expense of
dislocating a mile of the cavalcade, he struck into it. A
dyke had to be taken, some heavy fallows crossed, and the
way was straight before him. He began to sneer at the slow
jog-trot and absence of enterprise which made the fellows he
had left shine so poorly in comparison with the Goshawk, but
a sight of two cavaliers in advance checked his vanity, and
now to overtake them he tasked his fat Flemish mare with
unwonted pricks of the heel, that made her fling out and
show more mettle than speed.
The objects of this fiery chase did not at first awake to a
sense of being pursued. Both rode with mantled visages,
and appeared profoundly inattentive to the world outside
their meditations. But the Goshawk was not to be denied,
and by dint of alternately roaring at them and upbraiding
his two stumping beasts, he at last roused the younger of the
cavaliers, who called to his companion loudly: without effect,
it seemed, for he had to repeat the warning. Guy was close
up with them, when the youth exclaimed :
“Father ! holy father! 'Tis Sathanas in person !”
The other rose and pointed trembling to a dark point in
the distance as he vociferated :
“Not here ! not here ; but yonder !”
Guy recognized the voice of the first speaker, and cried :
“Stay! halt a second! Have you forgotten the Goshawk?"
“Never!” came the reply, “and forget not Farina !”

FARINA.
Spur and fleeter steeds carried them out of hearing ere
Guy could throw in another syllable. Farina gazed back on
him remorsefully, but the Monk now rated his assistant with
awful indignation.
“ Thou weak one ! nothing less than fool! to betray thy
name on such an adventure as this to soul save the saints !”
Farina tossed back his locks, and held his forehead to the
moon. All the Monk's ghostly wrath was foiled by the one
little last sweet word of his beloved, which made music in
his ears whenever annoyance sounded.
“And herein,” say the old writers, “are lovers, who love
truly, truly recompensed for their toils and pains; in that
love, for which they suffer, is ever present to ward away
suffering not sprung of love: but the disloyal, who serve not
love faithfully, are a race given over to whatso this base
world can wreak upon them, without consolation or comfort
of their mistress, Love; whom sacrificing not all to, they
know not to delight in.”
The soul of a lover lives through every member of him in
the joy of a moonlight ride. Sorrow and grief are slow dis-
tempers that crouch from the breeze, and nourish their natures
far from swift-moving things. A true lover is not one of
those melancholy flies that shoot and maze over muddy stag-
nant pools. He must be up in the great air. He must strike
all the strings of life. Swiftness is his rapture. In his
wide arms he embraces the whole form of beauty. Eagle-
like are his instincts ; dove-like his desires. Then the fair
moon is the very presence of his betrothed in heaven. So
for hours rode Farina in a silver-fleeting glory; while the
Monk, as a shadow, galloped stern and silent beside him.
So, crowning them in the sky, one half was all love and
light; one, blackness and fell purpose.


## p. 363 (#377) ############################################

THE COMBAT ON DRACHENFELS.
Not to earth was vouchsafed the honour of commencing the
great battle of that night. By an expiring blue-shot beam of
moonlight, Farina beheld a vast realm of gloom filling the
hollow of the West, and the moon was soon extinguished
behind sluggish scraps of iron scud detached from the
swinging bulk of ruin, as heavily it ground on the atmo-
sphere in the first thunder-launch of motion.
The heart of the youth was strong, but he could not view
without quicker fawning throbs this manifestation of
immeasurable power, which seemed as if with a stroke it
was capable of destroying creation and the works of man,
The bare aspect of the tempest lent terrors to the adventure
he was engaged in, and of which he knew not the aim, nor
might forecast the issue. Now there was nothing to illumine
their path but such forked flashes as lightning threw them
at intervals, touching here a hill with clustered cottages,
striking into day there a May-blossom, a patch of weed, a
single tree by the wayside. Suddenly a more vivid and
continuous quiver of violet fire met its reflection on the
landscape, and Farina saw the Rhine-stream beneath him.
“On such a night,” thought he, “Siegfried fought and
slew the dragon !”
A blast of light, as from the jaws of the defeated dragon
in his throes, made known to him the country he traversed.
Crimsoned above the water glimmered the monster-haunted

rock itself, and mid-channel beyond, flat and black to the
stream, stretched the Nuns' Isle in cloistral peace.
"Halt !” cried the Monk, and signaled with a peculiar
whistle, to which he seemed breathlessly awaiting an answer.
They were immediately surrounded by long-robed veiled figures.
“Not too late ? " the Monk hoarsely asked of them.
“Yet an hour !" was the reply, in soft clear tones of a
woman's voice.
“Great strength and valour more than human be mine,"
exclaimed the Monk, dismounting.
He passed apart from them; and they drew in a circle,
while he prayed, kneeling.
Presently he returned, and led Farina to a bank, drawing
from some hiding-place a book and a bell, which he gave
into the hands of the youth.
“For thy soul, no word !” said the Monk, speaking down
his throat as he took in breath. "Nay! not in answer to
me! Be faithful, and more than earthly fortune is thine;
for I say unto thee, I shall not fail, having' grace to sustain
this combat.”
Thereupon he commenced the ascent of Drachenfels.
Farina followed. He had no hint of the Monk's mission,
nor of the part himself was to play in it. Such a load of
silence gathered on his questioning spirit, that the outcry of
the raging elements alone prevented him from arresting the
Monk and demanding the end of his service there. That
outcry was enough to freeze speech on the very lips of a
mortal. For scarce had they got footing on the winding
path of the crags, when the whole vengeance of the storm
was hurled against the mountain. Huge blocks and boulders
were loosened and came bowling from above : trees torn by
their roots from the fissures whizzed on the eddies of the
wind : torrents of rain foamed down the iron flanks of rock,
and flew off in hoar feathers against the short pauses of dark-
ness: the mountain heaved, and quaked, and yawned a
succession of hideous chasms.

THE COMBAT ON DRACHENFELS. 365
“There's a devil in this,” thought Farina. He looked
back and marked the river imaging lurid abysses of cloud
above the mountain-summit-yea! and on the summit a
flaming shape was mirrored.
Two nervous hands stayed the cry on his mouth.
“Have I not warned thee?” said the husky voice of the
Monk. “I may well watch, and think for thee as for a dog.
Be thou as faithful !”.
He handed a flask to the youth, and bade him drink.
Farina drank and felt richly invigorated. The Monk then
took bell and book.
“But half-an-hour," he muttered, “for this combat that
is to ring through centuries.”
Crossing himself, he strode wildly upward. Farina saw
him beckon back once, and the next instant he was lost
round an incline of the highest peak.
The wind that had just screamed a thousand death-screams,
was now awfully dumb, albeit Farina could feel it lifting
hood and hair. In the unnatural stillness his ear received
tones of a hymn chanted below; now sinking, now swelling;
as though the voices faltered between prayer and inspiration.
Farina caught on a projection of crag, and fixed his eyes on
what was passing on the height.
There was the Monk in his brown hood and wrapper, con-
fronting—if he might trust his balls of sight—the red-hot
figure of the Prince of Darkness.
As yet no mortal tussle had taken place between them.
They were arguing : angrily, it was true : yet with the first
mutual deference of practised logicians. Latin and German
was alternately employed by both. It thrilled Farina's fervid
love of fatherland to hear the German Satan spoke : but
his Latin was good, and his command over that tongue
remarkable ; for, getting the worst of the argument, as usual,
be revenged himself by parodying one of the Church canticles
with a point that discomposed his adversary, and caused him
to retreat a step, claiming support against such shrewd assault.

* The use of an unexpected weapon in warfare is in itself
half a victory. Induce your antagonist to employ it as a
match for you, and reckon on completely routing him ...'
says the old military chronicle.
Come!” said the Demon with easy raillery. “You know
your game-I mine! I really want the good people to be
happy; dancing, kissing, propagating, what you will. We
quite agree. You can have no objection to me, but a foolish
old prejudice-not personal, but class; an antipathy of the
cowl, for which I pardon you! What I should find in you
to complain of—I have only to mention it, I am sure—is,
that perhaps you do speak a little too much through your
nose.”
The Monk did not fall into the jocular trap by retorting in
the same strain.
*Laugh with the Devil, and you won't laugh longest,'
says the proverb.
Keeping to his own arms, the holy man frowned.
“Avaunt, Fiend !” he cried. To thy kingdom below!
Thou hast raged over earth a month, causing blights,
hurricanes, and epidemics of the deadly sins. Parley no
more! Begone !"
The Demon smiled : the corners of his mouth ran up to his
ears, and his eyes slid down almost into one.
“Still through the nose !” said he reproachfully,
“I give thee Five Minutes !” cried the Monk.
“I had hoped for a longer colloquy,” sighed the Demon,
jogging his left leg and trifling with his tail.
“One Minute !” exclaimed the Monk.
“Truly so !” said the Demon. “I know Old Time and
his habits better than you really can. We meet every
Saturday night, and communicate our best jokes. I keep a
book of them Down There !”
And as if he had reason to remember the pavement of his
Halls, he stood tiptoe and whipped up his legs.
“Two Minutes !”

The Demon waved perfect acquiescence, and continued :
“We understand each other, he and I. All Old Ones do.
As long as he lasts, I shall. The thing that surprises me is,
that you and I cannot agree, similar as we are in temperament,
and playing for the long odds, both of us. My failure is,
perhaps, too great a passion for sport, aha! Well, 'tis a pity
you won't try and live on the benevolent principle. I am
indeed kind to them who commiserate my condition. I give
them all they want, aha! Hem! Try and not believe in
me now, aha! Ho!... Can't you? What are eyes ?
Persuade yourself you're dreaming. You can do anything
with a mind like yours, Father Gregory! And consider the
luxury of getting me out of the way so easily, as many do. It
is my finest suggestion, aha! Generally I myself nudge
their ribs with the capital idea-You're above bribes ? I was
going to observe-"
“ Three !”
-"Observe, that if you care for worldly honours, I can
smother you with that kind of thing. Several of your first-
rate people made a bargain with me when they were in the
fog, and owe me a trifle. Patronage they call it. I hook the
high and the low. Too-little and too-much serve me better
than Beelzebub. A weak stomach is certainly more carnally
virtuous than a full one. Consequently my kingdom is
becoming too respectable. They've all got titles, and object

“Not quite so fast, if you please. You want me gone.
Now, where's your charity? Do you ask me to be always
raking up those poor devils underneath? While I'm here,
they've a respite. They cannot think you kind, Father
Gregory! As for the harm, you see, I'm not the more
agreeable by being face to face with you—though some fair
dames do take to my person monstrously. The secret is, the
quantity of small talk I can command : that makes them
forget my smell, which is, I confess, abominable, displeasing
to myself, and my worst curse. Your sort, Father Gregory,
are somewhat unpleasant in that particular—if I may judge
by their Legate here. Well, try small talk. They would
fall desperately in love with polecats and skunks if endowed
with small talk. Why, they have become enamoured of
monks before now! If skunks, why not monks ? And
again—".
“Five !"
Having solemnly bellowed this tremendous number, the
holy man lifted his arms to begin the combat.
Farina felt his nerves prick with admiration of the ghostly
warrior daring the Second Power of Creation on that lonely
mountain-top. He expected, and shuddered at thought of
the most awful fight ever yet chronicled of those that have
taken place between heroes and the hounds of evil: but his
astonishment was great to hear the Demon, while Bell was
in air and Book aloft, retreat, shouting, “ Hold !”
" I surrender," said he, sullenly. “What terms ?”.
“ Instantaneous riddance of thee from face of earth.”
“Good !—Now,” said the Demon, “did you suppose I
was to be trapped into a fight? · No doubt you wish to
become a saint, and have everybody talking of my last
defeat. ... Pictures, poems, processions, with the Devil down-
most! No. You're more than a match for me."
“Silence, Darkness !” thundered the Monk, “and think
not to vanquish thy victor by flatteries. Begone !"
And again he towered in his wrath..

The Demon drew his tail between his legs, and threw the
forked, fleshy, quivering end over his shoulder. He then
nodded cheerfully, pointed his feet, and finicked a few steps
away, saying: “I hope we shall meet again.”
Upon that he shot out his wings, that were like the fins
of the wyver-fish, sharpened in venomous points.
“Commands for your people below ?” he inquired, leering
with chin awry. “Desperate ruffians some of those cowls.
You are right not to acknowledge them."
Farina beheld the holy man in no mood to let the Enemy
tamper with him longer.
The Demon was influenced by a like reflection ; for, saying,
“ Cologne is the city your Holiness inhabits, I think ?” he
shot up rocket-like over Rhineland, striking the entire
length of the stream, and its rough-bearded castle-crests,
slate-ledges, bramble-clefts, vine-slopes, and haunted valleys,
with one brimstone flash. Frankfort and the far Main saw
him and reddened. Ancient Trier and Mosel ; Heidelberg
and Neckar; Limberg and Lahn, ran guilty of him. And
the swift artery of these shining veins, Rhine, from his snow
cradle to his salt decease, glimmered Stygian horrors as the
Infernal Comet, sprung over Bonn, sparkled a fiery minute
along the face of the stream, and vanished, leaving a seam
alore the fametofitne or over
of ragged flame trailed on the midnight heavens.
Farina breathed hard through his teeth.
“ The last of him was awful,” said he, coming forward to
where the Monk knelt and grasped his breviary, “but he
was vanquished easily.”
“Easily?” exclaimed the holy man, gasping satisfaction :
“thou weakling! is it for thee to measure difficulties, or
estimate powers ? Easily ? thou worldling! and so are great
deeds judged when the danger's past! And what am I but
the humble instrument that brought about this wondrous
conquest ! the poor tool of this astounding triumph! Shall
the sword say, This is the battle I won! Yonder the enemy
I overthrew! Bow to me, ye lords of earth, and worshippers

of mighty acts ? Not so ! Nay, but the sword is honoured
in the hero's grasp, and if it break not, it is accounted trusty.
This, then, this little I may claim, that I was trusty! Trusty
in a heroic encounter! Trusty in a battle with earth's terror !
Oh! but this must not be said. This is to think too much !
This is to be more than aught yet achieved by man !”
The holy warrior crossed his arms, and gently bowed his
head.
“ Take me to the Sisters,” he said. “The spirit has gone
out of me! I am faint, and as a child !”
Farina asked, and had, his blessing.
“And with it my thanks !” said the Monk. “Thou hast
witnessed how he can be overcome! Thou hast looked upon
a scene that will be the glory of Christendom! Thou hast
beheld the discomfiture of Darkness before the voice of Light !
Yet think not much of me: account me little in this matter !
I am but an instrument ! but an instrument !-and again,
but an instrument !”
Farina drew the arms of the holy combatant across his
shoulders and descended Drachenfels.
The tempest was as a forgotten anguish. Bright with
maiden splendour shone the moon; and the old rocks,
cherished in her beams, put up their horns to blue heaven
once more. All the leafage of the land shook as to shake off
a wicked dream, and shuddered from time to time, whispering
of old fears quieted, and present peace. The heart of the
river fondled with the image of the moon in its depths.
“This is much to have won for earth,” murmured the
Monk. “And what is life, or who would not risk all, to
snatch such loveliness from the talons of the Fiend, the
Arch-foe? Yet, not I! not I! say not, 'twas I did this !”.
Soft praises of melody ascended to them on the moist
fragrance of air. It was the hymn of the Sisters.
“How sweet!” murmured the Monk. “Put it from me!
away with it!”
Rising on Farina's back, and stirruping his feet on the

thighs of the youth, he cried aloud : “I charge ye, whoso ye
be, sing not this deed before the emperor! By the breath
of your nostrils, pause ! ere ye whisper aught of the combat
of Saint Gregory with Satan, and his victory, and the marvel
of it, while he liveth ; for he would die the humble monk
he is."
He resumed his seat, and Farina brought him into the
circle of the Sisters. Those pure women took him, and
smoothed him, lamenting, and filling the night with
triumphing tones.
Farina stood apart.
“The breeze tells of dawn,” said the Monk; “we must be
in Cologne before broad day.”
They mounted horse, and the Sisters grouped and reverenced
under the blessing of the Monk.
“No word of it !” said the Monk warningly.
“We are silent, Father !” they answered.
“Cologne-ward !” was then his cry, and away he and
Farina flew.

THE GOSHAWK LEADS.
MORNING was among the gray eastern clouds as they rode
upon the camp hastily formed to meet the Kaiser. All there
was in a wallow of confusion. Fierce struggles for precedence
still went on in the neighbourhood of the imperial tent ground,
where, under the standard of Germany, lounged some veterans
of the Kaiser's guard, calmly watching the scramble. Up to
the edge of the cultivated land nothing was to be seen but
brawling clumps of warriors asserting the superior claims of
their respective lords. Variously and hotly disputed were
these claims, as many red coxcombs testified. Across that
point where the green field flourished, not a foot was set, for
the Kaiser's care of the farmer, and affection for good harvests,
made itself respected even in the heat of those jealous rivalries.
It was said of him, that he would have camped in a bog, or
taken quarters in a cathedral, rather than trample down a
green blade of wheat, or tum over one vine-pole in the
empire. Hence the presence of Kaiser Heinrich was never
hailed as Egypt's plague by the peasantry, but welcome as
the May month wherever he went.
Father Gregory and Farina found themselves in the centre
to where were he wented them
of a group ere they drew rein, and a cry rose, “The good
father shall decide, and all's fair,” followed by, “Agreed !
Hail and tempest! he's dropped down o' purpose.”
“Father,” said one, “ here it is! I say I saw the Devil
himself fly off Drachenfels, and flop into Cologne. Fritz

here, and Frankenbauch, saw him too. They'll swear to
him : so’ll I. Hell's thunder! will we. Yonder fellows
will have it 'twas a flash o' lightning, as if I didn't see him,
horns, tail, and claws, and a mighty sight 'twas, as I'm a
sinner.”
A clash of voices, for the Devil and against him, burst on
this accurate description of the evil spirit. The Monk sank
his neck into his chest.
“Gladly would I hold silence on this, my sons,” said he,
in a supplicating voice.
“Speak, Father," cried the first spokesman, gathering
courage from the looks of the Monk.
Father Gregory appeared to commune with himself deeply.
At last, lifting his head, and murmuring, “It must be,” he
said aloud:
"'Twas Satan, O my sons! Him this night in mortal
combat I encountered and overcame on the summit of
Drachenfels, before the eyes of this youth; and from Satan
I this night deliver ye! an instrument herein as in all other.”
Shouts, and a far-spreading buzz resounded in the camp.
Hundreds had now seen Satan flying off the Drachenstein.
Father Gregory could no longer hope to escape from the
importunate crowds that beset him for particulars. The
much-contested point now was, as to the exact position of
Satan's tail during his airy circuit, before descending into
Cologne. It lashed like a lion's. 'Twas cocked, for certain!
He sneaked it between his legs like a lurcher! He made it
stumpy as a brown bear's! He carried it upright as a pike !
“O my sons ! have I sown dissension ? Have I not given
ye peace ?" exclaimed the Monk.
But they continued to discuss it with increasing frenzy.
Farina cast a glance over the tumult, and beheld his friend
Guy beckoning earnestly. He had no difficulty in getting
away to him, as the fetters of all eyes were on the Monk
alone.
The Goshawk was stamping with excitement.

“Not a moment to be lost, my lad,” said Guy, catching
his arm. “Here, I've had half-a-dozen fights already for
this bit of ground. Do you know that fellow squatting
there ?"
Farina beheld the Thier at the entrance of a tumble-down
tent. He was ruefully rubbing a broken head.
“Now," continued Guy, “to mount him is the thing;
and then after the wolves of Werner as fast as horse-flesh
can carry us. No questions ! Bound, are you? And what
am I? But this is life and death, lad! Hark !”
The Goshawk whispered something that sucked the blood
out of Farina's cheek.
“Look you—what's your lockjaw name? Keep good
faith with me, and you shall have your revenge, and the
shiners I promise, besides my lord's interest for a better
master: but, sharp! we won't mount till we're out of sight
o'the hell-scum you horde with.”
The Thier stood up and staggered after them through the
camp. There was no difficulty in mounting him : horses
were loose, and scampering about the country, not yet delivered
from their terrors of the last night's tempest.
" Here be we, three good men !” exclaimed Guy, when
they were started, and Farina had hurriedly given him the
heads of his adventure with the Monk. “Three good men !
One has helped to kick the devil: one has served an appren-
ticeship to his limb: and one is ready to meet him foot to
foot any day, which last should be myself. Not a man
more do we want, though it were to fish up that treasure
you talk of being under the Rhine there, and guarded by I
don't know how many tricksy little villains. Horses can be
ferried across at Linz, you say?”
“Ay, thereabout,” grunted the Thier.
“ We're on the right road, then !” said Guy. “Thanks
to you both, I've had no sleep for two nights--not a wink,
and must snatch it going—not the first time.”
The Goshawk bent his body, and spoke no more. Farina

THE GOSHAWK LEADS.

"Punch shook his calu, Instant befond. The Goshez
could not get a word further from him. By the mastery he
still had over his rein, the Goshawk alone proved that he
was of the world of the living. Schwartz Thier, rendered
either sullen or stunned by the latest cracked crown he had
received, held his jaws close as if they had been nailed.
At Linz the horses were well breathed. The Goshawk,
who had been snoring an instant before, examined them
keenly, and shook his calculating head.
“Punch that beast of yours in the ribs," said he to
Farina. “Ah! not a yard of wind in him. And there's
the coming back, when we shall have more to carry. Well:
this is my lord's money; but i' faith, it's going in a good
cause, and Master Groschen will make it all right, no
doubt ; not a doubt of it.”
The Goshawk had seen some excellent beasts in the
stables of the Kaiser's Krone; but the landlord would make
no exchange without an advance of silver. This done, the
arrangement was prompt.
“Schwartz Thier !—I've got your name now,” said Guy,
as they were ferrying across, “ you're stiff certain they left
Cologne with the maiden yesternoon, now ?”.
“Ah, did they! and she's at the Eck safe enow by this
time.”
“And away from the Eck this night she shall come,
trust me!”
“Or there will I die with her !” cried Farina.
“Fifteen men at most, he has, you said,” continued Guy,
“Two not sound, five true as steel, and the rest shilly-shally.
Slife, one lock loose serves us; but two saves us : five we're
a match for, throwing in bluff Baron ; the remainder go with
victory."
“Can we trust this fellow?” whispered Farina.
“Trust him !” roared Guy. “Why, I've thumped him,
lad ; pegged and pardoned him. Trust him ? trust me! If
Werner catches a sight of that snout of his within half-a-mile
of his hold, he'll roast him alive."

He lowered his voice : “Trust him? We can do nothing
without him. I knocked the devil out of him early this
morning. No chance for his Highness anywhere now. This
Eck of Werner's would stand a siege from the Kaiser in
person, I hear. We must into it like weasels; and out as
we can.”
Dismissing the ferry-barge with stern injunctions to be in
waiting from noon to noon, the three leapt on their fresh nags.
“Stop at the first village," said Guy; “we must lay in
provision. As Master Groschen says, 'Nothing's to be done,
Turpin, without provender.'”
“Goshawk !” cried Farina ; " you have time ; tell me how
this business was done,”
The only reply was a soft but decided snore, that spoke,
like a voluptuous trumpet, of dreamland and its visions.
At Sinzig, the Thier laid his hand on Guy's bridle, with
the words, “Feed here," a brief, but effective, form of
signal, which aroused the Goshawk completely. The sign
of the Trauben received them. Here, Wurst reeking with
garlic, raw eggs, black bread, and sour wine, was all they
could procure. Farina refused to eat, and maintained his
resolution, in spite of Guy's sarcastic chiding.
“Rub down the beasts, then, and water them,” said the
latter. “Made a vow, I suppose," muttered Guy. “That's
the way of those fellows. No upright manly take-the-
thing-as-it-comes; but fly-sky-high whenever there's a dash
on their heaven. What has his belly done to offend him?
It will be crying out just when we want all quiet. I
wouldn't pay Werner such a compliment as go without
a breakfast for him. Not I! Would you, Schwartz Thier?”
“Henker! not I !” growled the Thier. “He'll lose one
sooner.”
“First snatch his prey, or he'll be making, God save us !
a meal for a Kaiser, the brute.”
Guy called in the landlady, clapped down the score, and
abused the wine.

“Sir,” said the landlady, "ours is but a poor inn, and we
do our best.”
“So you do," replied the Goshawk, softened ; "and I
say that a civil tongue and rosy smiles sweeten even sour
wine."
The landlady, a summer widow, blushed, and as he was
stepping from the room, called him aside.
“I thought you were one of that dreadful Werner's band,
and I hate him."
Guy undeceived her.
“He took my sister,” she went on, “and his cruelty killed
her. He persecuted me even in the lifetime of my good
man. Last night he came here in the middle of the storm
with a young creature bright as an angel, and sorrowful "
“He's gone, you're sure ? ” broke in Guy.
“Gone! Oh, yes! Soon as the storm abated he dragged
her on. Oh! the way that young thing looked at me, and I
able to do nothing for her.”
“Now, the Lord bless you for a rosy Christian !” cried
Guy, and, in his admiration, he flung his arm round her and .
sealed a ringing kiss on each cheek.
“No good man defrauded by that ! and let me see the
fellow that thinks evil of it. If I ever told a woman a
secret, I'd tell you one now, trust me. But I never do, so
farewell! Not another?”
Hasty times keep the feelings in a ferment, and the land-
lady was extremely angry with Guy and heartily forgave him,
all within a minute.
“No more,” said she, laughing : “but wait; I have some-
thing for you."
The Goshawk lingered on a fretting heel. She was quickly
under his elbow again with two flasks leaning from her
bosom to her arms.
“There ! I seldom meet a man like you; and, when I do,
I like to be remembered. This is a true good wine, real
Liebfrauenmilch, which I only give to choice customers.”

“Welcome it is !” sang Guy to her arch looks; “but I
must pay for it."
“Not a pfennig !” said the landlady.
“Not one ?”
“Not one !” she repeated, with a stamp of the foot.
“In other coin, then," quoth Guy; and folding her waist,
which did not this time back away, the favoured Goshawk
registered rosy payment on a very fresh red mouth, receiving
in return such lively discount, that he felt himself bound in
conscience to make up the full sum a second time.
“What a man !" sighed the landlady, as she watched the
Goshawk lead off along the banks ; "courtly as a knight,
open as a squire, and gentle as a page!”

WERNER’S ECK.
A LEAGUE behind Andernach, and more in the wintry circle
of the sun than Laach, its convenient monastic neighbour,
stood the castle of Werner, the Robber Baron. Far into the
South, hazy with afternoon light, a yellow succession of sand-
hills stretch away, spouting fire against the blue sky of an elder
world, but now dead and barren of herbage. Around is a
dusty plain, where the green blades of spring no sooner peep
than they become grimed with sand and take an aged look, in
accordance with the ungenerous harvests they promise. The
aridity of the prospect is relieved on one side by the lofty
woods of Laach, through which the sun setting burns golden-
red, and on the other by the silver sparkle of a narrow
winding stream, bordered with poplars, and seen but a
glistening mile of its length by all the thirsty hills. The
Eck, or Corner, itself, is thick-set with wood, but of a stunted
growth, and lying like a dark patch on the landscape. It
served, however, entirely to conceal the castle, and mask every
movement of the wary and terrible master. A trained eye
advancing on the copse would hardly mark the glimmer of
the turrets over the topmost leaves, but to every loophole of
the walls lies bare the circuit of the land. Werner could rule
with a glance the Rhine's course down from the broad rock
over Coblentz to the white tower of Andernach. He claimed
that march as his right; but the Mosel was no hard ride's
distance, and he gratified his thirst for rapine chiefly on that

river, delighting in it, consequently, as much as his robber
nature boiled over the bound of his feudal privileges.
Often had the baron held his own against sieges and
restrictions, bans and impositions of all kinds. He boasted
hat there was never a knight within twenty miles of him
that he had not beaten, nor monk of the same limit not in
his pay. This braggadocio received some warrant from his
yearly increase of licence; and his craft and his castle
combined, made him a notable pest of the region, a scandal
to the abbey whose countenance he had, and a frightful
infliction on the poorer farmers and peasantry.
The sun was beginning to slope over Laach, and threw the
shadows of the abbey-towers half-way across the blue lake-
waters, as two men in the garb of husbandmen emerged from
the wood. Their feet plunged heavily and their heads hung
down, as they strode beside a wain mounted with straw,
whistling an air of stupid unconcern ; but a close listener
might have heard that the lumbering vehicle carried a human
voice giving them directions as to the road they were to take,
and what sort of behaviour to observe under certain events.
The land was solitary. A boor passing asked whether toll
or tribute they were conveying to Werner. Tribute, they
were advised to reply, which caused him to shrug and curse
as he jogged on. Hearing him, the voice in the wain
chuckled grimly. Their next speech was with a trooper,
who overtook them, and wanted to know what they had in
the wain for Werner. Tribute, they replied, and won the
title of “brave pigs " for their trouble.
“But what's the dish made of ?" said the trooper, stirring
the straw with his sword-point.
“Tribute," came the answer.
“Ha! You've not been to Werner's school," and the
trooper swung a sword-stroke at the taller of the two,
sending a tremendous shudder throughout his frame; but he
held his head to the ground, and only seemed to betray
animal consciousness in leaning his ear closer to the wain.

WERNER'S ECK.

“Blood and storm! Will ye speak?” cried the trooper.
“Never talk much; but an ye say nothing to the
Baron,"—thrusting his hand into the straw—"here's what's
better than speaking.”
“Well said !Eh! Liebfrauenmilch ? Ho, ho! a rare
bleed!”
Striking the neck of the flask on a wheel, the trooper
applied it to his mouth, and ceased not deeply ingurgitating
till his face was broad to the sky and the bottle reversed.
He then dashed it down, sighed, and shook himself.
“Rare news! the Kaiser's come: he'll be in Cologne by
night; but first he must see the Baron, and I'm post with
the order. That's to show you how high he stands in the
Kaiser's grace. Don't be thinking of upsetting Werner yet,
any of you; mind, now !”
“ That's Blass-Gesell,” said the voice in the wain, as the
trooper trotted on: adding, “'gainst us.”
“Makes six,” responded the driver.
Within sight of the Eck, they descried another trooper
coming toward them. This time the driver was first to
speak.
“Tribute! Provender! Bread and wine for the high
Baron Werner from his vassals over Tönnistein.”
"And I'm out of it ! fasting like a winter wolf,” howled
the fellow.
He was in the act of addressing himself to an inspection
of the wain's contents, when a second flask lifted in air, .
gave a sop to his curiosity. This flask suffered the fate of
the former.
“A Swabian blockhead, aren't you ?”
“Ay, that country,” said the driver. “May be, Henker
Rothhals happens to be with the Baron ?”
“To hell with him ! I wish he had my job, and I his, of
watching the yellow-bird in her new cage, till she's taken out
to-night, and then a jolly bumper to the Baron all round.”
The driver wished him a fortunate journey, strongly

recommending him to skirt the abbey westward, and go by
the Ahr valley, as there was something stirring that way,
and mumbling, “Makes five again," as he put the wheels in
motion.
“Goshawk!” said his visible companion ; "what do you
say now?"
“I say, bless that widow !”
“Oh! bring me face to face with this accursed Werner
quickly, my God!” gasped the youth.
“ Tush! 'tis not Werner we want—there's the Thier
speaking. No, no, Schwartz Thier! I trust you, no doubt;
but the badger smells at a hole, before he goes inside it.
We're strangers, and are allowed to miss our way."
Leaving the wain in Farina's charge, he pushed through a
dense growth of shrub and underwood, and came crouching
on a precipitous edge of shrouded crag, which commanded a
view of the stronghold, extending round it, as if scooped
clean by some natural action, about a stone's-throw distant,
and nearly level with the look-out tower. Sheer from a
deep circular basin clothed with wood, and bottomed with
grass and bubbling water, rose a naked moss-stained rock, on
whose peak the castle firmly perched, like a spying hawk.
The only means of access was by a narrow natural bridge of
rock flung from this insulated pinnacle across to the main-
land. One man, well disposed, might have held it against forty.
“Our way's the best," thought Guy, as he meditated
every mode of gaining admission. “A hundred men an
hour might be lost cutting steps up that steep slate; and
once at the top we should only have to be shoved down again."
While thus engaged, he heard a summons sounded from
the castle, and scrambled back to Farina.
“The Thier leads now," said he, “and who leads is
captain. It seems easier to get out of that than in. There's a
square tower, and a round. I guess the maiden to be in the
round. Now, lad, no crying out—You don't come in with
us; but back you go for the horses, and have them ready

and fresh in yon watered meadow under the castle. The
path down winds easy.”
“ Man!” cried Farina, “what do you take me for ?-go
you for the horses."
“Not for a fool,” Guy rejoined, tightening his lip; “but
now is your time to prove yourself one."
“ With you, or without you, I enter that castle !”
“Oh! if you want to be served up hot for the Baron's
supper-mess, by all means.”
“Thunder !” growled Schwartz Thier, “ aren't ye
moving ?”
The Goshawk beckoned Farina aside.
“Act as I tell you, or I'm for Cologne.”
“ Traitor !” muttered the youth.
“Swearing this, that if we fail, the Baron shall need a
leech sooner than a bride."
“That stroke must be mine!"
The Goshawk griped the muscle of Farina's arm till the
youth was compelled to slacken it with pain.
“Could you drive a knife through a six-inch wood-wall ?
I doubt this wild boar wants a harder hit than many a bes
man could give. Sblood ! obey, sirrah. How shall we keep
yon fellow true, if he sees we're at points ? ”
“I yield,” exclaimed Farina with a fall of the chest;
“but hear I nothing of you by midnight-Oh! then think
not I shall leave another minute to chance. Farewell !
haste! Heaven prosper you! You will see her, and die
under her eyes. That may be denied to me. What have I
done to be refused that last boon?”.
“Gone without breakfast and dinner,” said Guy in
abhorrent tones.
A whistle from the wain, following a noise of the castle-
gates being flung open, called the Goshawk away, and he
slouched his shoulders and strode to do his part, without
another word. Farina gazed after him, and dropped into
the covert.

THE WATER-LADY.
*BIRD of lovers! Voice of the passion of love ! Sweet,
deep, disaster-toning nightingale !'sings the old minnesinger;
who that has not loved, hearing thee is touched with the
wand of love's mysteries, and yearneth to he knoweth not
whom, humbled by overfulness of heart; but who, listening,
already loveth, heareth the language he would speak, yet
faileth in ; feeleth the great tongueless sea of his infinite
desires stirred beyond his narrow bosom; is as one stript of
wings whom the angels beckon to their silver homes : and
he leaneth forward to ascend to them, and is mocked by his
effort : then is he of the fallen, and of the fallen would he
remain, but that tears lighten him, and through the tears
stream jewelled shafts dropt down to him from the sky,
precious ladders inlaid with amethyst, sapphire, blended
jasper, beryl, rose-ruby, ether of heaven flushed with softened
bloom of the insufferable Presences : and lo, the ladders
dance, and quiver, and waylay his eyelids, and a second time
he is mocked, aspiring : and after the third swoon standeth
Hope before him with folded arms, and eyes dry of the delu-
sions of tears, saying, Thou hast seen! thou hast felt ! thy
strength hath reached in thee so far! now shall I never die
in thee !!
For surely,' says the minstrel, “Hope is not born of
earth, or it were perishable. Rather know her the offspring
of that embrace strong love straineth the heavens with.

This owe we to thy music, bridal nightingale! And the
difference of this celestial spirit from the smirking phantasy
of whom all stand soon or late forsaken, is the difference
between painted day with its poor ambitious snares, and
night lifting its myriad tapers round the throne of the
eternal, the prophet stars of everlasting time! And the one
dieth, and the other liveth; and the one is unregretted, and
the other walketh in thought-spun raiment of divine melan-
choly; her ears crowded with the pale surges that wrap this
shifting shore ; in her eyes a shape of beauty floating dimly,
that she will not attain this side the water, but broodeth on
evermore.
Therefore, hold on thy cherished four long notes, which
are as the very edge where exultation and anguish melt,
meet, and are sharpened to one ecstasy, death-dividing bird !
Fill the woods with passionate chuckle and sob, sweet chap-
lain of the marriage-service of a soul with heaven! Pour out
thy holy wine of song upon the soft-footed darkness, till,
like a priest of the inmost temple, 'tis drunken with fair
intelligences !' .
Thus the old minstrels and minnesingers.
Strong and full sang the nightingales that night Farina held
watch by the guilty castle that entombed his living beloved.
The castle looked itself a denser shade among the moon-
thrown shadows of rock and tree. The meadow spread like
a green courtyard at the castle's foot. It was of lush deep
emerald grass, softly mixed with gray in the moon's light,
and showing like jasper. Where the shadows fell thickest,
there was yet a mist of colour. All about ran a brook, and
babbled to itself. The spring crocus lifted its head in moist
mid-grasses of the meadow, rejoiced with freshness. The
rugged heights seemed to clasp this one innocent spot as their
only garden-treasure ; and a bank of hazels hid it from the
castle with a lover's arm.'
“ The moon will tell me," mused Farina ; "the moon will

signal me the hour! When the moon hangs over the round
tower, I shall know 'tis time to strike.”
The song of the nightingales was a full unceasing throb.
It went like the outcry of one heart from branch to branch.
The four long notes, and the short fifth which leads off to
that hurried gush of music, gurgling rich with passion, came
thick and constant from under the tremulous leaves.
At first Farina had been deaf to them. His heart was in
the dungeon with Margarita, or with the Goshawk in his
dangers, forming a thousand desperate plans, among the red-
hot ploughshares of desperate action. Finally, without a
sense of being wooed, it was won. The tenderness of his
love then mastered him.
“God will not suffer that fair head to come to harm !” he
thought, and with the thought a load fell off his breast.
He paced the meadows, and patted the three pasturing
steeds. Involuntarily his sight grew on the moon. She
went so slowly. She seemed not to move at all. A little
wing of vapour flew toward her; it whitened, passed, and
the moon was slower than before. Oh! were the heavens
delaying their march to look on this iniquity ? Again and
again he cried, “Patience, it is not time !” He flung himself
on the grass, and watched the stillness in alien trance. The
next moment he climbed the heights, and was peering at the
mass of gloom that fronted the blue sky with blackness. It
reared such a mailed head of menace, that his heart was
seized with a quivering, as though it had been struck.
Behind lay scattered some small faint-twinkling stars on
sapphire fields, and a stain of yellow light was in a breach of
one wall.
He descended. What was the Goshawk doing? Was he
betrayed ? It was surely now time? No; the moon had
not yet smitten the face of the castle. He made his way
through the hazel-bank among flitting night-moths, and
glanced up to measure the moon's distance. As he did so, a
first touch of silver fell on the hoary flint.

“Oh, young bird of heaven in that Devil's clutch !"
Sounds like the baying of boar-hounds alarmed him.
They whined into silence.
He fell back. The meadow breathed peace, and more and
more the nightingales volumed their notes. As in a charmed
circle of palpitating song, he succumbed to languor. The
brook rolled beside him fresh as an infant, toying with the
moonlight. He leaned over it, and thrice waywardly dipped
his hand in the clear translucence.
Was it his own face imaged there?
Farina bent close above an eddy of the water. It whirled
with a strange tumult, breaking into lines and lights a face
not his own, nor the moon's; nor was it a reflection. The
agitation increased. Now a wreath of bubbles crowned the
pool, and a pure water-lily, but larger, ascended wavering.
He started aside; and under him a bright head, garlanded
with gemmed roses, appeared. No fairer figure of woman
had Farina seen. Her visage had the lustrous white of
moonlight, and all her shape undulated in a dress of flashing
silver-white, wonderful to see. The Lady of the Water smiled
on him, and ran over with ripples and dimples of limpid
beauty. Then, as he retreated on the meadow grass, she
swam toward him, and taking his hand, pressed it to her.
After her touch the youth no longer feared. She curved her
finger, and beckoned him on. All that she did was done
flowingly. The youth was a shadow in her silver track.
Her own shadow was but the fainter effluence of her form,
and moved pale as she passed like a harmless wave over the
closed crocuses; but the crocuses shivered and swelled their
throats of streaked purple and argent as at delicious rare sips
of a precious wine. Breath of violet, and ladysmock, and
valley-lily, mingled and fluttered, at whiles faint, and again
fresh, about her. Farina was as a man working the day's
intent in a dream. He could see the heart in her trans-
lucent, hanging like a cold dingy ruby. By the purity of his
nature he felt that such a presence must have come but to
help. It might be Margarita's guardian fairy !

They passed the hazel-bank, and rounded the castle-crag,
washed by the brook and, beneath the advancing moon,
standing in a ring of brawling silver. The youth with his
fervid eyes marked the old weather-stains and scars of long
defiance coming into colour. That mystery of wickedness
which the towers had worn in the dusk, was dissolved, and
he endured no more the almost abashed sensation of com-
peting littleness that made him think there was nought to do,
save die, combating single-handed such massive power. The
moon shone calmly superior, like the prowess of maiden
knights; and now the harsh frown of the walls struck
resolution to his spirit, and nerved him with hate and the
contempt true courage feels when matched against fraud and
villany.
On a fallen block of slate, cushioned with rich brown moss
and rusted weather-stains, the Water-Lady sat, and pointed
to Farina the path of the moon toward the round tower.
She did not speak, and if his lips parted, put her cold finger
across them. Then she began to hum a soft sweet monotony
of song, vague and careless, very witching to hear. Farina
caught no words, nor whether the song was of days in dust
or in flower, but his mind bloomed with legends and sad
splendours of story, while she sang on the slate-block under
sprinkled shadows by the water.
He had listened long in trance, when the Water-Lady
hushed, and stretched forth a slender forefinger to the moon.
It stood like a dot over the round tower. Farina rose in
haste. She did not leave him to ask her aid, but took his
hand and led him up the steep ascent. Half-way to the
castle, she rested. There, concealed by bramble-tufts, she
disclosed the low portal of a secret passage, and pushed it
open without effort. She paused at the entrance, and he
could see her trembling, seeming to wax taller, till she was
like a fountain glittering in the cold light. Then she dropped,
as drops a dying jet, and cowered into the passage.
Darkness, thick with earth-dews, oppressed his senses.

He felt the clamor guiding bounday. Pas
He felt the clammy walls scraping close on him. Not the
dimmest lamp, or guiding sound, was near; but the lady
went on as one who knew her way. Passing a low-vaulted
dungeon-room, they wound up stairs hewn in the rock, and
came to a door, obedient to her touch, which displayed a
chamber faintly misted by a solitary bar of moonlight. Farina
perceived they were above the foundation of the castle. The
walls gleamed pale with knightly harness, habergeons gaping
for heads, breast-plates of blue steel, halbert, and hand-axe,
greaves, glaives, boar-spears, and polished spur-fixed heel-
pieces. He seized a falchion hanging apart, but the lady
stayed his arm, and led to another flight of stone ending in
a kind of corridor. Noises of laughter and high feasting
beset him at this point. The Lady of the Water sidled her
head, as to note a familiar voice; and then drew him to a
looped aperture.
Farina beheld a scene that first dazzled, but, as it grew into
shape, sank him with dismay. Below, and level with the
chamber he had left, a rude banqueting-hall glowed, under the
light of a dozen flambeaux, with smoking boar's flesh, deer's
flesh, stone-flagons, and horn-beakers. At the head of this
board sat Werner, scarlet with furious feasting, and on his
right hand, Margarita, bloodless as a beautiful martyr bound
to the fire. Retainers of Werner occupied the length of the
hall, chorusing the Baron's speeches, and drinking their own
· healths when there was no call for another. Farina saw his
beloved alone. She was dressed as when he parted with her
last. The dear cameo lay on her bosom, but not heaving
proudly as of old. Her shoulders were drooped forward, and
contracted her bosom in its heaving. She would have had a
humbled look, but for the marble sternness of her eyes. They
were fixed as eyes that see the way of death through all
carthly objects.
“Now, dogs!” cried the Baron, “ the health of the night!
and swell your lungs, for I'll have no cat's cry when Werner's
bride is the toast. Monk or no monk's leave, she's mine.

Ay, my pretty one ! it shall be made right in the morning, if
I lead all the Laach rats here by the nose. Thunder! no
disrespect to Werner's bride from pope or abbot. Now, sing
out !-or wait ! these fellows shall drink it first."
He tossed a beaker of wine right and left behind him, and
Farina's despair stiffened his limbs as he recognised the
Goshawk and Schwartz Thier strapped to the floor. Their
beards were already moist with previous libations similarly
bestowed, and they received this in sullen stillness; but
Farina thought he observed a rapid glance of encouragement
dart from beneath the Goshawk's bent brows, as Margarita
momentarily turned her head half-way on him.
“Lick your chaps, ye beasts, and don't say Werner stints
vermin good cheer his nuptial-night. Now," continued the
Baron, growing huskier as he talked louder : “Short and
ringing, my devil's pups :-Werner and his Bride ! and may
she soon give you a young baron to keep you in better order
than I can, as, if she does her duty, she will."
The Baron stood up, and lifted his huge arm to lead the toast.
“ Werner and his Bride!”.
Not a voice followed him. There was a sudden intimation
of the call being echoed; but it snapped, and ended in
shuffling tones, as if the hall door had closed on the response.
“What's this?" roared the Baron, in that caged wild-beast
voice Margarita remembered she had heard in the Cathedral
Square.
No one replied.
“Speak! or I'll rot you a fathom in the rock, curs ! ”
“Herr Baron !” said Henker Rothhals impressively; “ the
matter is, that there's something unholy among us.”
The Baron's goblet flew at his head before the words were
uttered.
“I'll make an unholy thing of him that says it," and
Werner lowered at them one by one.
“Then I say it, Herr Baron !” pursued Henker Rothhals,
wiping his frontispiece : “ The Devil has turned against you

at last. Look up there—Ah, it's gone now; but where's the
man sitting this side saw it not ?"
The Baron made one spring, and stood on the board.
“Now! will any rascal here please to say so ?”
Something in the cruel hang of his threatening hatchet
jaw silenced many in the act of confirming the assertion.
“Stand out, Henker Rothhals !”
Rothhals slid a hunting-knife up his wrist, and stepped
back from the board.
“Beast !” roared the Baron, “I said I wouldn't shed
blood to-night. I spared a traitor, and an enemy-
“Look again !” said Rothhals; “ will any fellow say
he saw nothing there ? ”.
While all heads, including Werner's, were directed to
the aperture which surveyed them, Rothhals tossed his
knife to the Goshawk unperceived.
This time answers came to his challenge, but not in
confirmation. The Baron spoke with a gasping gentleness.
“So you trifle with me? I'm dangerous for that game.
Mind you of Blassgesell? I made a better beast of him by
sending him three-quarters of the road to hell for trial.”
Bellowing—“Take that !” he discharged a broad blade,
hitherto concealed in his right hand, straight at Rothhals.
It fixed in his check and jaw, wringing an awful breath
of pain from him as he fell against the wall.
“There's a lesson for you not to cross me, children !"
said Werner, striding his stumpy legs up and down the
crashing board, and puffing his monstrous girth of chest and
midriff. “Let him stop there awhile, to show what comes
of thwarting Werner !—Fire-devils ! before the baroness,
too !-Something unholy is there! Something unholy in
his jaw, I think !-Leave it sticking !-He's against me at
last, is he? I'll teach you who he's for !-Who speaks ?”
All hung silent. These men were animals dominated by
a mightier brute.
He clasped his throat, and shook the board with a jump,

as he squeaked, rather than called, a second time—“ Who
spoke?”
He had not again to ask. In this pause, as the Baron
glared for his victim, a song, so softly sung that it sounded
remote, but of which every syllable was clearly rounded,
swelled into his ears, and froze him in his angry posture.
“The blood of the barons shall turn to ice,
And their castle fall to wreck,
When a true lover dips in the water thrice,
That runs round Werner's Eck.
“Round Werner's Eck the water runs;
The hazels shiver and shake :
The walls that have blotted such happy suns,
Are seized with the ruin.quake.
“And quake with the ruin, and quake with rue,
Thou last of Werner's race !
The hearts of the barons were cold that knew
The Water-Dame's embrace.
“For a sin was done, and a shame was wrought,
That water went to hide :
And those who thought to make it nought,
They did but spread it wide.
“Hold ready, hold ready to pay the price,
And keep thy bridal cheer :
A hand has dipped in the water thrice,
And the Water-Dame is here."

THE RESCUE.
THE Goshawk was on his feet. “Now, lass,” said he to
Margarita, “now is the time !" He took her hand, and led
her to the door. Schwartz Thier closed up behind her.
Not a man in the hall interposed. Werner's head moved
round after them, like a dog on the watch; but he was dumb.
The door opened, and Farina entered. He bore a sheaf of
weapons under his arm. The familiar sight relieved Werner's
senses from the charm. He shouted to bar the prisoners'
passage. His men were ranged like statues in the hall.
There was a start among them, as if that terrible noise com-
municated an instinct of obedience, but no more. They
glanced at each other, and remained quiet.
The Goshawk had his eye on Werner. “Stand back,
lass !” he said to Margarita. She took a sword from Farina,
and answered, with white lips and flashing eyes, “I can
fight, Goshawk!"
“And shall, if need be; but leave it to me now," returned
Guy.
His eye never left the Baron. Suddenly a shriek of steel
rang. All fell aside, and the combatants stood opposed on
clear ground. Farina took Margarita's left hand, and placed
her against the wall between the Thier and himself. Werner's
men were well content to let their master fight it out. The
words spoken by Henker Rothhals, that the Devil had

forsaken him, seemed in their minds confirmed by the weird
song which every one present could swear he heard with his
ears. “Let him take his chance, and try his own luck,”
they said, and shrugged. The battle was between Guy, as
Margarita’s champion, and Werner.
In Schwartz Thier's judgement, the two were well matched,
and he estimated their diverse qualities from sharp experience.
“For short work the Baron, and my new mate for tough
standing to't !” Farina's summary in favour of the Goshawk
was, “A stouter heart, harder sinews, and a good cause."
The combat was generally regarded with a professional eye,
and few prayers. Margarita solely there asked aid from
above, and knelt to the Virgin; but her, too, the clash of
arms and dire earnest of mortal fight aroused to eager eyes.
She had not dallied with heroes in her dreams. She was as
ready to second Siegfried on the crimson field as tend him in
the silken chamber.
It was well that a woman's heart was there to mark the
grace and glory of manhood in upright, foot-to-foot encounter.
For the others, it was a mere calculation of lucky hits. Even
Farina, in his anxiety for her, saw but the brightening and
darkening of the prospect of escape in every attitude and
hard-ringing blow. Margarita was possessed with a painful
exaltation. In her eyes the bestial Baron now took a nobler
form and countenance; but the Goshawk assumed the
sovereign aspect of old heroes, who, whether persecuted or
favoured of heaven, still maintained their stand, remembering
of what stuff they were, and who made them.
"Never,' say the old writers, with a fervour honourable
to their knowledge of the elements that compose our being,
never may this bright privilege of fair fight depart from
us, nor advantage of it fail to be taken! Man against man,
or beast, singly keeping his ground, is as fine rapture to the
breast as Beauty in her softest hour affordeth. For if woman
taketh loveliness to her when she languisheth, so surely doth

man in these fierce moods, when steel and iron sparkle
opposed, and their breath is fire, and their lips white with
the lock of resolution; all their faculties knotted to a point,
and their energies alive as the daylight to prove themselves
superior, according to the laws and under the blessing of
chivalry.'
For all,' they go on to improve the comparison, 'may
admire and delight in fair blossoming dales under the blue
dome of peace ; but 'tis the rare lofty heart alone compre-
hendeth, and is heightened by, terrific splendours of tempest,
when cloud meets cloud in skies black as the sepulchre, and
Glory sits like a flame on the helm of Ruin.'
For a while the combatants aired their dexterity, con-
tenting themselves with cunning cuts and flicks of the sword-
edge, in which Werner first drew blood by a keen sweep
along the forehead of the Goshawk. Guy had allowed him
to keep his position on the board, and still fought at his face
and neck. He now jerked back his body from the hip, and
swung a round stroke at Werner's knee, sending him in
retreat with a snort of pain. Before the Baron could make
good his ground, Guy was level with him on the board.
Werner turned an upbraiding howl at his men. They
were not disposed to second him yet. They one and all
approved his personal battle with Fate, and never more
admired him and felt his power; but the affair was exciting,
and they were not the pillars to prop a falling house.
Werner clenched his two hands to his ponderous glaive,
and fell upon Guy with heavier fury. He was becoming not
unworth the little womanly appreciation Margarita was.
brought to bestow on him. The voice of the Water-Lady
whispered at her heart that the Baron warred on his destiny,
and that ennobles all living souls.
Bare-headed the combatants engaged, and the head-piece
was the chief point of attack. No swerving from blows was
possible for either : ward, or take ; a false step would have

ensured defeat. This also induced cauiion. Many a double
stamp of the foot was heard, as each had to retire in
turn.
“Not at his head so much, he'll bear battering there all
night long,” said Henker Rothhals in a breathing interval.
Knocks had been pretty equally exchanged, but the Baron's
head certainly looked the least vulnerable, whereas Guy ex-
hibited several dints streaming freely. Yet he looked, eye
and bearing, as fresh as when they began, and the calm,
regular heave of his chest contrasted with Werner's quick
gasps. His smile, too, renewed each time the Baron paused
for breath, gave Margarita heart. It was not a taunting
smile, but one of entire confidence, and told all the more on
his adversary. As Werner led off again, and the choice was
always left him, every expression of the Goshawk's face
passed to full light in his broad eyes.
The Baron's play was a reckless fury. There was nothing
to study in it. Guy became the chief object of speculation.
He was evidently trying to wind his man. He struck wildly,
some thought. Others judged that he was a random hitter,
and had no mortal point in aim. Schwartz Thier's opinion
was frequently vented. “Too round a stroke--down on
him! Chop-not slice !"
Guy persevered in his own fashion. According to Schwartz
Thier, he brought down by his wilfulness the blow that took
him on the left shoulder, and nigh broke him. It was a
weighty blow, followed by a thump of sound. The sword-
edge swerved on his shoulder-blade, or he must have been
disabled. But Werner's crow was short, and he had no time
to push his success. One of the Goshawk's swooping under.
hits half severed his right wrist, and the blood spirted across
the board. He gasped and seemed to succumb, but held to
it still, though with slackened force. Guy now attacked.
Holding to his round strokes, he accustomed Werner to
guard the body, and stood to it so briskly right and left, that
Werner grew bewildered, lost his caution, and gave ground.

Suddenly the Goshawk's glaive flashed in air, and chopped
sheer down on Werner's head. So shrewd a blow it was
against a half-formed defence, that the Baron dropped without
a word right on the edge of the board, and there hung,
feebly grasping with his fingers.
“Who bars the way now ? " sang out Guy.
No one accepted the challenge. Success clothed him with
terrors, and gave him giant size.
“Then fare you well, my merry men all,” said Guy.
“ Bear me no ill-will for this. A little doctoring will right
the bold Baron.”
He strode jauntily to the verge of the board, and held his
finger for Margarita to follow. She stepped forward. The
men put their beards together, muttering. She could not
advance. Farina doubled his elbow, and presented sword-
point. Three of the ruffians now disputed the way with
bare steel. Margarita looked at the Goshawk. He was
smiling calmly curious as he leaned over his sword, and gave
her an encouraging nod. She made another step in defiance.
One fellow stretched his hand to arrest her. All her
maidenly pride stood up at once. “What a glorious girl ! "
murmured the Goshawk, as he saw her face suddenly flash,
and she retreated a pace and swung a sharp cut across the
knuckles of her assailant, daring him, or one of them, with
hard, bright eyes, beautifully vindictive, to lay hand on a
pure maiden.
“You have it, Bärenleib !” cried the others, and then to
Margarita : “Look, young mistress ! we are poor fellows,
and ask a trifle of ransom, and then part friends."
“Not an ace !” the Goshawk pronounced from his post.
“Two to one, remember.”
“ The odds are ours,” replied the Goshawk confidently.
They ranged themselves in front of the hall-door. Instead
of accepting this challenge, Guy stepped to Werner, and
laid his moaning foe lengthwise in an easier posture. He
then lifted Margarita on the board, and summoned them

with cry of “Free passage !” They answered by a sullen
shrug and taunt.
“Schwartz Thier! Rothhals ! Farina! buckle up, and
make ready then,” sang Guy.
He measured the length of his sword, and raised it. The
Goshawk had not underrated his enemies. He was tempted
to despise them when he marked their gradually lengthening
chaps and eyeballs.
Not one of them moved. All gazed at him as if their
marrows were freezing with horror.
" What's this?” cried Guy.
They knew as little as he, but a force was behind them
irresistible against their efforts. The groaning oak slipped
open, pushing them forward, and an apparition glided past,
soft as the pallid silver of the moon. She slid to the Baron,
and put her arms about him, and sang to him. Had the
Water-Lady laid an iron hand on all those ruffians, she could
not have held them faster bound than did the fear of her
presence. The Goshawk drew his fair charge through them,
followed by Farina, the Thier, and Rothhals. A last glimpse
of the hall showed them still as old cathedral effigies staring
at white light on a fluted pillar of the wall.

THE PASSAGE OF THE RHINE.
Low among the swarthy sandhills behind the Abbey of
Laach dropped the round red moon. Soft lengths of misty
yellow stole through the glens of Rhineland. The
nightingales still sang alone. Closer and closer the moon
came into the hushed valleys.
There is a dell behind Hammerstein Castle, a ring of
basking sward, girdled by a silver slate-brook, and guarded
by four high-peaked hills that slope down four long wooded
corners to the grassy base. Here, it is said, the elves and
earthmen play mad pranks, dancing in circles with laughing
feet that fatten the mushroom. They would have been
fulfilling the tradition now, but that the place was occupied
by a sturdy group of mortals, armed with staves. The
intruders were sleepy, and lounged about on the inclines.
Now and then two got up, and there rang hard echoes of
oak. Again all were calm as cud-chewing cattle, and the
white water sang pleased with quiet,
It may be that the elves brewed mischief among them ;
for the oaken blows were becoming more frequent. One
complained of a kick : another demanded satisfaction for a
pinch. “Go to," drawled the accused drowsily in both
cases, “ too much beer last night! too much !” Within
three minutes, the company counted three broken heads.
There was a plastering pause. The East was winning on the

West in heaven, and the dusk was thinning. They began
to mark, each, whom he had cudgelled. A noise of some-
thing swiftly in motion made them alert. A roebuck rushed
down one of the hills, and scampered across the sward. The
fine beast went stretching so rapidly away as to be hardly
distinct.
“Sathanas once more !” they murmured, and drew
together.
“ Sathanas! Sathanas !” passed through them like a
watchword.
“ Not Sathanas this time,” cried the two new-comers,
emerging from the foliage. “He's safe under Cologne—the
worse for all good men who live there ! But come ! follow
to the Rhine! there's work for us on the yonder side, and
sharp work.”
“Why," answered several, “ we've our challenge with
the lads of Leutesdorf and Wied to-day.”
“D’ye see this?” said the foremost of the others, pointing
to a carved ivory white rose in his cap.
"Brothers !” he swelled his voice, “follow with a will,
for the White Rose is in danger ! ”
Immediately they ranked, and followed zealously through
the buds of young bushes, and over heaps of damp dead
leaves, a half-hour's scramble, when they defiled under
Hammerstein, and stood before the Rhine. Their leader led
up the river, and after a hasty walk, stopped, loosened his
hood, and stripped.
“Now," said he, strapping the bundle to his back, “let.
me know the hound that refuses to follow his leader when
the White Rose is in danger.”
“Long live Dietrich !” they shouted. He dropped from
the bank, and waded in. He was soon supported by the
remainder of the striplings, and all struck out boldly into
mid-stream.
Never heard history of a nobler Passage of the Rhine than
this made between Andernach and Hammerstein by members

of the White Rose Club, bundle on back, to relieve the
White Rose of Germany froni thrall and shame!
They were taken far down by the rapid current, and
arrived panting to land. The dressing done, they marched
up the pass of Tönnistein, and took a deep draught at the
spring of pleasant waters there open to wayfarers. Arrived
at the skirts of Laach, they beheld two farmer peasants
lashed back to back against a hazel. They released them,
but could gain no word of information, as the fellows, after
a yawn and a wink, started off, all heels, to make sure of
liberty. On the shores of the lake the brotherhood descried
a body of youths, whom they hailed, and were welcomed
to companionship.
“Where's Berthold ?” asked Dietrich.
He was not present.
“The more glory for us, then,” said Dietrich.
It was here seriously put to the captain, whether they
should not halt at the abbey, and refect, seeing that great
work was in prospect.
“Truly," quoth Dietrich, “dying on an empty stomach
is heathenish, and cold blood makes a green wound gape.
Kaiser Conrad should be hospitable, and the monks honour
numbers. Here be we, thirty and nine; let us go !”
The West was dark blue with fallen light. The lake-
waters were growing gray with twilight. The abbey stood
muffled in shadows. Already the youths had commenced
battering at the convent doors, when they were summoned
by the voice of the Goshawk on horseback. To their con-
fusion they beheld the White Rose herself on his right hand.
Chapfallen Dietrich bowed to his sweet mistress.
“We were coming to the rescue,” he stammered.
A laugh broke from the Goshawk. “You thought the
lady was locked up in the ghostly larder; eh ?”
Dietrich seized his sword, and tightened his belt. “The
club allow no jesting with the White Rose, Sir Stranger."
Margarita made peace. “I thank you all, good friends.

But quarrel not, I pray you, with them that save me at the
risk of their lives."
“Our service is equal," said the Goshawk, flourishing-
“Only we happen to be beforehand with the club, for
which Farina and myself heartily beg pardon of the entire
brotherhood.”
“Farina !” exclaimed Dietrich. “Then we make a
prisoner instead of uncaging a captive.”
“ What's this?” said Guy.
“So much," responded Dietrich. “Yonder's a runaway
from two masters : the law of Cologne, and the conqueror of
Sathanas; and all good citizens are empowered to bring him
back, dead or alive."
“Dietrich! Dietrich ! dare you talk thus of the man who
saved me?” cried Margarita.
Dietrich sullenly persisted.
“Then, look !” said the White Rose, reddening under the
pale dawn; "he shall not, he shall not go with you."
One of the club was here on the point of speaking to the
White Rose,-a breach of the captain's privilege. Dietrich
felled him unresisting to earth, and resumed: “It must be
done, Beauty of Cologne ! the monk, father Gregory, is
now enduring shame and scorn for lack of this truant
witness.”
“Enough ! I go!” said Farina.
“You leave me?" Margarita looked tender reproach.
Weariness and fierce excitement had given a liquid flame to
her eyes and an endearing darkness round their circles that
matched strangely with her plump youth. Her features had
à soft white flush. She was less radiant, but never looked
so bewitching. An aspect of sweet human languor caught
at the heart of love, and raised tumults.
" It is a duty,” said Farina.
“Then go," she beckoned, and held her hand for him to
kiss. He raised it to his lips. This was seen of all the
club.

As they were departing with Farina, and Guy prepared to
demand admittance into the convent, Dietrich chanced to ask
how fared Dame Lisbeth. Schwartz Thier was by, and
answered, with a laugh, that he had quite forgotten the little
lady.
“We took her in mistake for you, mistress! She was a one
to scream! The moment she was kissed---mum as a cloister.
We kissed her, all of us, for the fun of it. No harm—no
harm! We should have dropped her when we found we had
the old bird 'stead of the young one, but reckoned ransom, ye
see. She's at the Eck, rattling, I's wager, like last year's nut
in the shell !”
“Lisbeth! Lisbeth ! poor Lisbeth; we will return to her.
Instantly,” cried Margarita.
“ Not you,” said Guy.
“Yes! I!”
“No !” said Guy.
“ Gallant Goshawk ! best of birds, let me go !”
“Without me or Farina, never! I see I shall have no
chance with my lord now. Come, then, come, fair Irresistible !
come, lads. Farina can journey back alone. You shall have
the renown of rescuing Dame Lisbeth.”
"Farina ! forget not to comfort my father,” said Margarita.
Farina bowed.
Between Margarita's society, and Farina's, there was little
dispute in the captain's mind which choice to make. Farina
was allowed to travel single to Cologne ; and Dietrich, petted
by Margarita, and gently jeered by Guy, headed the club
from Laach waters to the castle of the Robber Baron.

of recedies of clou the sun here
MONK GREGORY was pacing the high road between the
Imperial camp and suffering Cologne. The sun had risen
through interminable distauces of cloud that held him
remote in a succession of receding mounds and thinner veils,
realm beyond realm, till he showed fireless, like a phantom
king in a phantom land. The lark was in the breast of
morning. The field-mouse ran along the furrows. Dews
hung red and gray on the weedy banks and wayside trees.
At times the nostril of the good father was lifted, and he
beat his breast, relapsing into sorrowful contemplation.
Passed any citizen of Cologne, the ghostly head slunk into
its cowl. “There's a black raven !” said many. Monk
Gregory heard them, and murmured, “Thou hast me,
Sathanas! thou hast me !"
It was noon when Farina came clattering down from the
camp.
"Father,” said he, “I have sought thee.”
“My son!” exclaimed Monk Gregory with silencing
hand, “ thou didst not well to leave me contending against
the tongues of doubt. Answer me not. The maiden ! and
what weighed she in such a scale ?—No more! I am
punished. Well speaks the ancient proverb:
'Beware the back-blows of Sathanas!'

of self-incense. I hear the demons shouting their chorus-
Here comes Monk Gregory, who called himself Conqueror
of Darkness !' In the camp I am discredited and a scoff;
in the city I am spat upon, abhorred. Sathanas, my
son, fights not with his fore-claws. 'Tis with his tail he
fights, O Farina !-Listen, my son ! he entered to his king-
dom below through Cologne, even under the stones of the
Cathedral Square, and the stench of him abominably re-
maineth, challenging the nostrils of holy and unholy alike.
The Kaiser cannot approach for him; the citizens are
outraged. Oh! had I held my peace in humbleness, I had
truly conquered him. But he gave me easy victory, to
inflate me. I shall not last. Now this only is left, my son ;
that thou bear living testimony to the truth of my statement,
as I bear it to the folly!”
Farina promised, in the face of all, he would proclaim and
witness to his victory on Drachenfels.
“That I may not be ranked an impostor ! ” continued
the Monk. “And how great must be the virtue of them
that encounter Sathanas ! Valour availeth nought. But if
virtue be not in ye, soon will ye be puffed to bursting with
that devil's poison, self-incense. Surely, my son, thou art
faithful, and for this service I can reward thee. Follow me
yet again.”
On the road they met Gottlieb Groschen, hastening to the
camp. Dismay rumpled the old merchant's honest jowl.
Farina drew rein before him.
“Your daughter is safe, worthy Master Groschen,” said
he.
“Safe ? ” cried Gottlieb; " where is she, my Grete ?"
Farina briefly explained. Gottlieb spread out his arms, and
was going to thank the youth. He saw Father Gregory,
and his whole frame narrowed with disgust.
“Are you in company with that pestilent animal, that
curse of Cologne !”

“You are leagued with him, then, sirrah! Expect no
thanks from me. Cologne, I say, is cursed! Meddling
wretches ! could ye not leave Sathanas alone? He hurt us
not. We were free of him. Cologne, I say, is cursed !
The enemy of mankind is brought by you to be the deadly
foe of Cologne."
So saying, Gottlieb departed.
“Seest thou, my son,” quoth the Monk, “they reason
not!”
Farina was dejected. Willingly would he, for his part,
have left Sathanas a loose rover for the sake of some
brighter horizon to his hope.
No twinge of remorse accompanied Gottlieb. The Kaiser
had allotted him an encampment and a guard of honour for
his household while the pestilence raged, and there Gottlieb
welcomed back Margarita and Aunt Lisbeth on the noon
after his meeting with Farina. The White Rose had rested
at Laach, and was blooming again. She and the Goshawk
came trotting in advance of the club through the woods of
Laach, startling the deer with laughter, and sending the
hare with her ears laid back all across the country. In vain
Dietrich menaced Guy with the terrors of the club : Aunt
Lisbeth begged of Margarita not to leave her with the foot
men in vain. The joyous couple galloped over the country,
and sprang the ditches, and leapt the dykes, up and down
the banks, glad as morning hawks, entering Andernach at a
round pace; where they rested at a hostel, now bearing the
name of the Lily, and as capable of producing good Rhine
and Mosel wine then as now. Here they had mid-day's
meal laid out in the garden for the angry club, and some-
what appeased them on their arrival with bumpers of the
ancient Armbruster's best Scharzhofberger and Liebfrauen-
milch. After a refreshing halt, three boats were hired.
On their passage to the river, they encountered a procession
of monks headed by the Archbishop of Andernach, bearing
a small figure of Christ carved in blackthorn and varnished:

said to work miracles, and a present to the good town from
two Hungarian pilgrims.
“ Are ye for Cologne ?” the monks inquired of them.
“Direct down stream !” they answered.
“Send, then, hither to us Gregory, the conqueror of
Sathanas, that he may know there is gratitude on earth
and gratulation for great deeds,” said the monks.
So with genuflexions the travellers proceeded, and
entered the boats by the Archbishop's White Tower.
Hammerstein Castle and Rheineck they floated under ;
Salzig and the Ahr confluence; Rolandseck and Nonnenwerth;
Drachenfels and Bonn; hills green with young vines ; dells
waving fresh foliage. Margarita sang as they floated.
Ancient ballads she sang that made the Goshawk sigh
for home, and affected the club with delirious love for the
grand old water that was speeding them onward. Aunt
Lisbeth was not to be moved. She alone held down her
head. She looked not Gottlieb in the face as he embraced
her. Nor to any questioning would she vouchsafe reply.
From that time forth, she was charity to woman; and the
exuberant cheerfulness and familiarity of the men toward her
soon grew kindly and respectful. The dragon in Aunt Lisbeth
was destroyed. She objected no more to Margarita's cameo.
The Goshawk quickly made peace with his lord, and
enjoyed the commendation of the Kaiser. Dietrich Schill
thought of challenging him; but the club had graver
business : and this was to pass sentence on Berthold
Schmidt for the crime of betraying the White Rose into the
hands of Werner. They had found Berthold at the Eck,
and there consented to let him remain until ransom was paid
for his traitorous body. Berthold in his mad passion
was tricked by Werner, and on his release, by payment of
the ransom, submitted to the judgement of the club, which
condemned him to fight them all in turn, and then endure
banishment from Rhineland; the Goshawk, for his sister's
suke, interceding before a harsher tribunal.

THE ENTRY INTO COLOGNE.
SEVEN days Kaiser Heinrich remained camped outside
Cologne. Six times in six successive days the Kaiser
attempted to enter the city, and was foiled.
“Beard of Barbarossa !” said the Kaiser, “this is the
first stronghold that ever resisted me.”
The warrior bishops, electors, pfalzgrafs, and knights of
the Empire, all swore it was no shame not to be a matchi
for Sathanas.
“If,” said the reflective Kaiser, “we are to suffer below
what poor Cologne is doomed to undergo now, let us, by all
that is savoury, reform and do penance.”
The wind just then setting on them dead from Cologne
made the courtiers serious. Many thought of their souls for
the first time.
This is recorded to the honour of Monk Gregory.
On the seventh morning, the Kaiser announced his
determination to make a last trial.
It was dawn, and a youth stood before the Kaiser's tent,
praying an audience.
Conducted into the presence of the Kaiser, the youth,
they say, succeeded in arousing him from his depression, for,
brave as he was, Kaiser Heinrich dreaded the issue. Forth-
with order was given for the cavalcade to set out according
to the rescript, Kaiser Heinrich retaining the youth at his

right hand. But the youth had found occasion to visit
Gottlieb and Margarita, each of whom he furnished with a
flask, curiously shaped, and charged with a distillation.
As the head of the procession reached the gates of Cologne,
symptoms of wavering were manifest.
Kaiser Heinrich commanded an advance, at all cost.
Pfalzgraf Nase led the van, and pushed desperately across
the draw-bridge.
Hesitation and signs of horror began to assail the assemblage ·
round the Kaiser's person. The Kaiser and the youth at his
right hand were cheery. Not a whit drooped they! Several
of the heroic knights begged the Kaiser's permission to fall
back.
“Follow Pfalzgraf Nase !" cried the Kaiser.
Great was the wonderment of the people of Cologne to
behold Kaiser Heinrich riding in perfect stateliness up the
main street toward the Cathedral, while right and left of
him bishops and electors were dropping incapable.
The Kaiser advanced till by his side the youth rode sole.
“ Thy name ?” said the Kaiser.
He answered: “A poor youth, unconquerable Kaiser !
Farina I am called.”
“Thy recompense ?” said the Kaiser.
He answered : “ The hand of a maiden of Cologne, most
gracious Kaiser and master !”
“She is thine !” said the Kaiser.
Kaiser Heinrich looked behind him, and among a host
grasping the pommels of their saddles, and reeling van-
quished, were but two erect, a maiden and an old man.
“ That is she, unconquerable Kaiser !” Farina continued,
bowing low.
“It shall be arranged on the spot," said the Kaiser.
A word from Kaiser Heinrich sealed Gottlieb's com-
pliance.
Said he: “Gracious Kaiser and master! though such a
youth could of himself never have aspired to the possession

FARINA.
of a Groschen, yet when the Kaiser pleads for him, objection
is as the rock of Moses, and streams consent. Truly he has
done Cologne good service, and if Margarita, my daughter,
can be persuaded—”
The Kaiser addressed her with his blazing brows.
Margarita blushed a ready autumn of rosy-ripe acquiescence.
“A marriage registered yonder !” said the Kaiser, pointing
upward.
“I am thine," murmured Margarita, as Farina drew near
her.
“ Seal it ! seal it !” quoth the Kaiser, in hearty good
humour; “take no consent from man or maid without a
seal."
Farina tossed the contents of a flask in air, and saluted
his beloved on the lips.
This scene took place near the charred round of earth
where Sathanas descended to his kingdom below.
Men now pervaded Cologne with flasks, purifying the
atmosphere. It became possible to breathe freely.
“We Germans,” said Kaiser Heinrich, when he was again
surrounded by his courtiers, “may go sometimes wrong, if
we always follow Pfalzgraf Nase." Whereat there was
obsequious laughter.
The Pfalzgraf pleaded a susceptible nostril,
“ Thou art, I fear, but a timid mortal,” said the Kaiser.
“Never have I been found so on the German Field,
Imperial Majesty ! ” returned the Pfalzgraf. "I take glory
to myself that the reek of Sathanas overcomes me.”
“Even that we must combat, you see !” exclaimed Kaiser
Heinrich ; “but come all to a marriage this night, and take
brides as soon as you will, all of you. Increase, and give us
loyal subjects in plenty. I count prosperity by the number
of marriages in my empire !”
The White Rose Club were invited by Gottlieb to the
wedding, and took it in vast wrath until they saw the
Kaiser, and such excellent stout German fare present, when

immediately a battle raged who should do the event most
honour, and was in dispute till dawn: Dietrich Schill being
the man, he having consumed Wurst the length of his arm,
and wine sufficient to have floated a St. Goar salmon; which
was long proudly chronicled in his family, and is now un-
earthed from among the ancient honourable records of
Cologne.
The Goshawk was Farina's bridesman, and a very spiriting
bridesman was he! Aunt Lisbeth sat in a corner, faintly
smiling.
“Child !” said the little lady to Margarita when they
kissed at parting, “your courage amazes me. Do you think?
Do you know? Poor sweet bird, delivered over hand and
foot !”
“I love him! I love him, aunty! that's all I know," said
Margarita : “ love, love, love him!”
“Heaven help you !" ejaculated Aunt Lisbeth.
“Pray with me,” said Margarita.
The two knelt at the foot of the bride-bed, and prayed very
different prayers, but to the same end. That done, Aunt
Lisbeth helped undress the White Rose, and trembled, and
told a sad nuptial anecdote of Höllenbogenblitz, and put her
little shrivelled hand on Margarita's heart, and shrieked.
“ Child ! it gallops !” she cried.
- 'Tis happiness,” said Margarita, standing in her hair.
“May it last only !” exclaimed Aunt Lisbeth.
“It will, aunty! I am humble : I am true;" and the
fair girl gathered the frill of her nightgown.
“Look not in the glass,” said Lisbeth; “not to-night!
Look, if you can, to-morrow."
She smoothed the White Rose in her bed, tucked her up,
and kissed her, leaving her as a bud that waits for sunshine.

CONCLUSION.
The shadow of Monk Gregory was seen no more in Cologne.
He entered the Calendar, and ranks next St. Anthony. For
three successive centuries the towns of Rhineland boasted
his visits in the flesh, and the conqueror of Sathanas caused
dire Rhenish feuds.
Sathanas repeated his famous Back-blow on Farina. The
youth awoke one morning and beheld warehouses the exact
pattern of his own, displaying flasks shaped even as his own
and twelve Farinas to right and left of him. In a week,
they were doubled. A month quadrupled them. They
increased.
“Fame and Fortune," mused Farina, “come from man
and the world. Love is from heaven. We may be worthy,
and lose the first. We lose not love unless unworthy.
Would ye know the true Farina? Look for him who walks
under the seal of bliss : whose darling is for ever his young
sweet bride, leading him from snares, priming his soul with
celestial freshness. There is no hypocrisy can ape that aspect.
Least of all, the creatures of Sathanas! By this I may be
known."
Seven years after, when the Goshawk came into Cologne
to see old friends, and drink some of Gottlieb's oldest
Rüdesheimer, he was waylaid fifty times by false Farinas;
and only discovered the true one at last, by chance, in the
music-gardens near the Rhine, where Farina sat, having on
one hand Margarita, and at his feet three boys and one girl,
over whom both bent lovingly, like the parent vine fondling
its grape-bunches in summer light.
THE END.
