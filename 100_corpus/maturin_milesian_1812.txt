Wise wretch, with too much learning to be taught,
With too much thinking to have common thought,
You purchase pain with all that joy can give,
And die of nothing, but a rage to live.

IN the winter of - the royal fa-
mily of Naples were driven to seek for re-
fuge in their Sicilian dominions. The pre-
ceding autumn had been marked by un-
common splendour and gaiety. The ap-
proaching darkness of the political hori-
zou seemed to have no effect on the spirits
of a dissipated court, except to contrast
their strange and inauspicious brilliancy.
But of all the fêtes given at that period,

that of Lord Montclare, an English no-
bleman, lately arrived at Naples, was the
most distinguished. His villa, at a little
distance from the city, commanded the
most exquisite scenery of the bay: every
recess of the apartments displayed chef-
d'oeuvres of ancient art and modern lux-
ury; yet the splendid crowd gazed care-
lessly on all these wonders. His daugh-
ter had not yet appeared.
This young female had been seen but
once since her arrival in Naples ; but
report had already represented her as
uniting in her mind and form the charms
of all the muses and all the graces. She
bad appeared one night at the English
ambassador's; but some accident had
prevented the exhibition of her talents ;
when, after much importunity, she con-
sented to sing : the indisposition of the
principal accompaniment compelled her,
after a few bars, suddenly to stop. A
circle of literati then collected round her,
and she was beginning to converse,

when the entrance of one of the royal
family, who was passionately fond of
dancing, put an end to conversation.
She then stood up to dance, but had
hardly joined the set, when her father,
who was in the balcony conversing with
a monk, suddenly fainting, she hurried
away to attend him, and was seen do
more : yet this imperfect display of her
powers, the few words she had uttered,
the few notes she had sung, and her
figure, as it hovered on the verge of the
dance half-ready for flight, had left such
an impression, that all who could
procure
admission crowded to Lord Montclare's
villa that night, in hopes of seeing her
again.
Till she appeared every one was em.
ployed in making or answering inquiries
about her and her father. Of Lord
Montclare little was known, but that he
was an English peer who had resided
many years in Italy, married an Italian of

rank, and was now a widower with an
only daughter.
It was said that since the death of his
wife he had been immersed in melancholy.
He perpetually changed his residence:
he was pursued every where by a monk,
whose presence sometimes produced the
most terrible effects on him, and that no
object appeared to excite him but the
cultivation of his daughter's talents,
whom he had surrounded from infancy
with the first mastèrs, and in whose edu-
cation he had required them to combine
every thing brilliant, seductive, and com-
manding :-to make her sing like a muse,
dance like a grace, compose like a Sap-
pho, and declaim like an Aspasia.
At this moment Lord Montclare bimself
appeared, conversing with the very monk,
and an English officer whom he had re-
cognized as, his nephew, and led him
into another apartment to introduce him
to his daughter.

The monk joined a group of Italians
who were speaking of their host, and
expressing their surprise that with such
a daughter Lord Montclare could ever
be the victim of that dejection his fea-
tures betrayed.
Splendid talents,” said the monk,
" often cause more uneasiness than tri.
umph: she has too much genius, perhaps
too much pride, to be happy: her talents
and her sensibility have been refined till
neither her own excellence or the applausés
of others afford her any further pleasure.”
The Italians inquired if her talents
were really so various and powerful as
they were reported.
“ Yes," said the monk, “ her talents
are real, but her character is artificial,
Nature intended her for a superior being,
a genius ; but pride, flattery, and an
ambitious education, have made her
mere woman. There she stands," he con-
tinued, suddenly pointing to the music-
room, which was just thrown open, and

every eye instantly followed the direction
of his hand:
A young female, whose exquisite
figure seemed to exceed the maturity of
her years, which could hardly be eigh-
teen, was leaning on an instrument in the
music-room. The blazing orchestra in
which she stood strongly contrasted and
defined her light but marked figure, the
simplicity of her white dress, and dark
folded hair, and the marble paleness and
contour of her face: she was reading
some music which a composer had just
presented to her ; and the transient
gleams of expression, and the imperfect
movements of pleasure, that played like
beautiful coruscations over her face and
figure, as the passages she read struck or
pleased her, developed resources in her
figure such as could not be imagined
from a first view of it. Her attitude
and appearance were simple, yet there
was a prophetic repose in her dark eyes
when she raised them, and a kind of

proud consciousness, mixed with indolence
and melancholy in her looks, that verified
the character given her by the monk,
Shortly after she turned to speak to
the English officer, whom her father in-
troduced as her kinsman, and the Italians
for the first time heard the music of her
voice.
The Englishman addressed some com-
mon-place flattery to her, such as he
tbought would please a vain, pedantic
female ; but the hauteur which she sud-
denly assumed disconcerted him, and be,
was silent.
She bowed to him with something of
female insolence in her air, and then
glancing at her dress, hastened from the
room.
“ And does she always appear with,
this careless simplicity?" said the Ita-
lians, surprised at the light and girlish
figure they had beheld.
Frequently,” said the monk; "often

her to appear, she enters habited as you
saw her to-night, whilst the arrangement
of her light drapery, the placing of an
antique ornament, the very manner in
which she folds her long hair, gives so
exquisite a resemblance of some classical
model, that she draws every eye from the
sparkling signoras around her.”
Two of the company, who had seen ber
at Rome, now joined them, and confirmed
the monk's observations,
“I was at a musical assembly," said
one of them, " where Armida was expect-
ed, and we all waited anxiously for her
appearance : she entered late, resisted all
importunity to sing, and at length ascend-
ed the orchestra with a mixture of timi.
dity and negligence that confounded the
spectators. She sung the first part of
the air Solto Voce, and kept the bearers
in a state between surprise and distrust,
till almost at the close she uttered a few
notes with so piercing, so potent an ex-
pression, that the susceptible sbivered and

wept, and the judges felt she was mistress
of all the wonders of her art."
Often," said the other, " at an as-
sembly where the first literary characters
were assembled to meet her, Armida has
remained silent and absent till almost
forgotten, when a single remark, an allu-
sion, an illustration that appeared to
escape from her lips almost unconsciously,
penetrated at once into the depth of the
subject of which the rest had only been
hovering on the surface; and while the
room echoed with praise, she appeared to
retreat from those praises as if they were
bestowed on exertions far inferior to what
she was capable of, whilst her bending
head, her silent deprecation, the retiring
consciousness of her whole figure, spoke
more pride than the most ostentatious
avidity of praise."
"Such is her character," said the
monk. “Though her mother was an Ita-
lian, she was born in England, and af-
terwards educated here; and this accounts

for the mixture of English pride and
Italian indolence that her character ex-
bibits, combined with a voluptuous me-
lancholy, the result of both climate and
education."
The apartments were now full: the
company, to avoid the intense heat, had
many of them retired to a balcony that
admitted the sea breeze. The English
officer was standing apart, when a cur-
tain, suddenly raised, discovered a scene
of such beauty, that every one felt Ar-
mida was the artist.
It was a small apartment, which her
paintings had converted into a kind of
theatre, and to which they had given a
range of view and a depth of perspective
that delighted even the scientific Ita-
lians. It represented the garden of an
oriental palace: the sides filled with
flowers, whose lofty and luxuriant clus-
ters seemed to rise above the height of
the apartment, and whose deep and sunny
hues were softened by the magic diffusion

of the lights ; and the perspective, ter-,
minated in an arch, beyond which was
caught a view of the ruins of Persepolis.
Charactered with all the spectral gran-
deur, the prostrate dignity of antiquity,
they presented that mixture of deviation
and decay that combines our admiration,
of greatness with our interest in debility:
The daring and gigantic style of the
ruins seemed to realize the idea of the
modern Persians, that the “palace of
forty pillars” is the work of super-human
hands, and the haunt of the spirits of
former ages.
The sculptures and relics were
touched with a legendary truth that
proved an equal knowledge of history
and design ; but the luxury of colouring,
the picturesque associations, and the
fairy touches of invention, made the
artist
every
where felt through the work.
The perspective, prolonged through a
range of pillars and arches, of fragments
and foliage, was flushed with that rich

and lovely light that displayed the powers
of the most inspired imagination embo-
dying the glories of the most resplendent
climate.
Armida advanced on the stage alone :
she was in the oriental dress, and she had
-an instrument in her hand resembling the
lute. Wandesford gazed with astonish-
ment: the pale, slight, simply clad girl
he had lately seen was transformed into
the most brilliant female in the world.
The colour which applause brought to
her cheek mantled richly through the
tinge of rouge she had put on to conceal
the effects of her exertions.
She appeared as the oriental muse, and
recited a poem she had translated from
the Persian, sometimes accompanying
herself on the instrument in her hand.
The Scavans could easily discover how
much the poem was indebted to the trans-
lator; and the resources she displayed
filled them with astonishment. The

touched on, or spared, with that familia-
rity which implies volumes ; and the
wonders of eastern fable were decorated
with all the melodious pomp of Italian
modulation : but the critics remarked
that she dwelt much on description and
little on passion, and seemed fonder of
displaying the powers that dazzle the
imagination than those that touch and
enchain the heart : but all power of
criticism was forgot, when, at the close of
the poem, she burst into a song of tri-
umph to congratulate the victory of her
hero. She hung her lute on one of the
pillars of the scene, and, accompanied by
a band concealed behind it, gave herself
up to the display of those amazing vocal
powers which she had suppressed during
the recitation. The torrent of sound
that she now poured forth, the beight to
which she soared, the rapidity with
which she traversed intervals that con-
nected the widest extremes of human
voice, the precision with which she

marked their minutest subdivisions, and,
above all, the ease of attitude and expres-
sion which she preserved amid her exer-
tions, like a skilful cbarioteer, who com-
mands and enjoys the flight of his cours-
ers, whilst their speed terrifies the spec-
tators, filled the Italians with a sensation
which applause could neither express or
exhaust.
Armida retired amid these applauses
overcome with fatigue and emotion, but
still preserving a proud triumph of ex-
pression through her faltering steps and
exhausted frame.
Amid the tumult of delight Wandes-
ford alone remained silent. The first
impression that he felt was that he had
witnessed a piece of mechanism : the mu-
sic, the paintings, the graces of motion,
and the radiations of genius he had wit-
Dessed, seemed the result of a deception

opportunity : but his resolution was de-
feated in a moment by the appearance
of
Armida, who was discovered, as the cur-
tain again was unfolded, in the costume
of the Grecian muse.
The local scenery was taken from
Athens, and the parthenon and the tem-
ple of the wiods 'were sketched in the
perspective with the boldness of a master,
and the graphic precision of an historian.
Among the picturesque and indefinite
touches of the scenery the Italians ob-
served almost every ruin of classic cele-
brity, the pediments, the entablatures,
the urns that formed the ornament of their
cabinets, and the study of their anti-
quaries.
The antique truth of the pictures, the
mellow light that was artfully effused
over them; the severity of the architec-
ture, and the chaster brilliancy of the
climate, were a refreshing contrast to the
luxuriant colours and lavish magnificence
of the oriental landscape; and the per-

fect and regular beauty of Armida was
more visible amid the scene that surround-
ed her, and in the white, simple, statue-
like, drapery she wore.
She made a few
remarks on the ancient drama, on their
powers of expressing passions by attitude,
and she alluded to some classical
passages
which describe a long and varied narra-
tive, represented by the gestures of a
single performer. The novelty of hearing
the laws of the Greek drama discussed
by a girl of eighteen with the elocution
and
grace of an Aspasia was forgot even
by Wandesford, as he gazed on her
beautiful figure, whose attitudes, like
the chords of an instrument, seemed sus.
ceptible of every modulation that the
endless varieties of passion can give or
require. The Italians were delighted to
bebold those models of grace and ex-
pression which had so long been confined
to painting and marble revived in the
figure before them, with all the animation
of life, and the magic graces of motion ;

and they were amazed at the facility with
which she passed from the rigid and
breathless calm of a vestal to the luxu-
rious frenzy of a bacchante. But she
had reserved all her strength for the last
exertion, in which she represented the
story of Niobe. The spectators felt the
very wounds, of which each seemed to
pierce her through : they looked to every
variation of the action as a respite from
their sensations, yet each was more pain-
ful than the preceding. But when the
last blow was aimed, when her dark,
speaking eye was fixed, as if by fascina-
tion, on the winged death that approach-
ed, when shrinking into herself she seem-
ed trying to hide her last child within her
very vitals, when with short and hopeless
catchings she spread to more than its ut-
most extent the vain defence of her robe,
and the rigid agony of her limbs almost
shewed the beginning encroachments of
the stone upon the principles of life, a
conyulsive shudder pervaded the whole

assembly, nor was it till after some mo.
ments that it was perceived she had fainted
from her exertions. In the confusion that
followed, Wandesford tried to recover
hișnself. Cold, selfish, unprincipled, and
unfeeling, he had never suffered so much
disturbance either from pleasure or pain
before. The first sight of Arinida had
banished his usual indifference to female
beauty: with the first sentence she ut-
tered had ceased his usual contempt for
female understanding. As her astonish-
ing talents were developed, he expected
to see some vanity, some female art, or
weakness developed along with them, that
would console him for the superiority he
was compelled to acknowledge. He could
discover none.
Yet amid her most bril-
liant moments there appeared a melan-
choly, an abstraction, a gloom of mor-
tality, which, united with her beauty and
extreme youth, made her the most inter-
esting creature he had ever beheld. Al-
most every one had now quitted the

without imagining or wishing for other
sources of trappiness.
He turned away from the monk. The
company, invited by the moonlight beauty
of the gardens, wandered through them
in groups, and he joined them: every
where he heard the praises of Armida,
but no where could he see her. He
wandered into the remoter parts of the
garden: it was midnight: he stood on
the bank of a canal shaded by orange-
trees; all above was brightness, all
around was fragrance, all below was
calm-even Wandesford was touched:
he thought of Armida almost with the
delicacy of passion. At that moment the
sound of a harp issued from the bowery
clusters of an Arabian jessamine beside
him. He turned, and saw Armida seated
alone in a recess forined by its rich and
odorous flowers: her attitude was that
of fatigue and melancholy, yet from
time to time she touched her harp with
an impulse that seemed to echo some

real emotion, and he repeated his fear
that such exertions were too much for
her.
“ I feel they are,” said Armida, calm-
ly; " I feel they will perhaps be fatal to
me; I almost wish they may.” She
paused, and looked up to the sparklinga
sky that seemed tremulous with the light
of ten thousand stars : “ I wish to pour
my last breath into a strain of music, and
waken to the harmony which those bright
worlds make to the ears of spirits-to
pass to heaven from those scenes which al
this earth resemble heaven."
“ Talk not of dying to go to heaven,"
said Wandesford, with profane gallantry,
“ for where you are must be heaven."
Armida seemed disconcerted at his
warmth, and still more that she had been
answered with common-place flattery.
Here,” said Armida, “I wished to
represent the difference between the east-
ern and western muse: I brought my
harp, and intended to have sung to it 2

poem of Ossian's I had translated amid
scenery that would have recalled the
sombrous imagery and luxurious melan-
choly of the bard, but I felt myself in-
capable of further exertion.” She con-
tinued to speak of Ossian, and her figure,
and the motion of her white arms, that
involuntarily touched her harp, seemed
to realize the visions of the “ soul of
song." She knew not that she was ad-
dressing a man who had never read Ossian
in his life, and the whole of whose poeti-
cal reading bad been confined to political
satires and bagatelles of the day.
But though Wandesford was insensible
to her genius, he was entranced by her
beauty, heightened as it was by the scene-
ry, the perfumed air, by an expression
of languid consciousness, and by her rich
seductive accents that rose like music on
the night. His vanity too mistook the
constraiot which she laid on her natural
indolence to converse with a stranger and
her kinsman for something of a stronger

interest, and he suddenly poured out his
feelings with a warmth which even sur-
prised himself, and with an energy of
expression that left Armida no power of
mistaking it for that general admiration
to which she was accustomed.
“ Let us join the company, signor,"
said she, calmly, but decisively, with-
drawing the hand which he had seized;
“ we have remained here too long."
“Yes,” said Wandesford, rising proud-
ly (for he had knelt),
have remained here too long, yet I feel
the impressions I have received here will
remain for ever : you are impatient to
join the company; you live but for crowds
and for their clamours. Pardon me,
beautiful Armida," he continued, "pro-
voked to speak with force, pardon me if
I wonder how such depravity of taste
can be united with such perfection of
talents."
“ If my taste is depraved,” said Ar-
mida, calmly, “ I am not to blame, but
yes, I feel I

those who educated me: if they have
taught me false pleasures and a false am-
bition, let me retain them. Perhaps if
you knew the lassitude, the gloom that
succeed the most triumphant moments of
my existence, you would not envy the
few I enjoy. The refinement which has
been the result of my acquirements has
deprived me of their enjoyment, and I
am like the bird, who, when he has filled
his nest with perfumes, consumes himself
with them and dies."
Wandesford was touched by this con-
fession; but again the selfishness of his
heart returned, and he believed it only
another wile of seduction the art of an
all-endowed deceiver, who could com-
bine the colours of manner as skilfully
as those of painting, and pass in a mo-
ment, for effect's sake, from the glare of
talent to the soft shade of sentiment.

spells, he fouņd their influence more ir-
resistible

to gaze and to listen, while he believed
every attitude the result of study, and
every
word the dictate of art; but he was
deceived by himself. Armida, always
too proud for concealment, and too con-
scious of great ideas to hide them, uttered
merely what she felt in one of those gloomy
moments which she owed to the very ex-
cess of her talents, the companionless and
magoificent solitude of her mind.
“I am wretched," she continued,
except in the tumultuous illusions of
a crowd that make me forget myself, or
those moments of lonely enthusiasm that
make me forget the world.” She at-
tempted to quit him as she spoke, but
Wandesford, whose feelings were ungo-
vernable, again threw himself at her feet
with the most rapturous expressions of
passion, while pride, and even resentment,
visibly struggled through his reluctant
homage.

it has inspired. Go to the lovely women

At this moment, the company, who had je

he was mortified to leave her the next
moment conversing with the Italians,
with that mixture of ease and abstraction
that marked her manner.
Refreshments were dispersed through
the gardens in recesses half concealed by
flowers, and shaded with the foliage of
trees, that seemed to shed their fruits on
the tables, and mingle their fragrance
with the rich wines that sparkled on
them.
Armida and a select party, principally
musical, partook of ices and fruits on
the bank of the canal, whose breezes
were the sweetest luxury of the night : it
was here she felt herself, and was resolved
to make all around feel her resistless.
The moonlight in which she sat seem-

and even her mind : she was more soft,
more solemn, and more touching than the
very light in which she sat. Fatigued

Homer in Darius's casket, breathed the
soul of genius from a vehicle of perfume,
she exhibited a soft soppression, a veiled
and waning splendour, not so dazzling
to the senses, but more touching to the
heart.
Music resounded from various parts
of the garden, accompanied only by the
echo and the stilly rushing of the breeze.
Armida was pressed to sing alone: she
declined it from the fatigue of her late
exertions, but from time to time she
joined in the harmony with tones whose
rich and tempered fulness was like the
sounds of some invisible instrument; and
sometimes in the pause of the voices she
executed a cadence so rapid, and sweet
aod subtle, as if a spirit in his passage

caught the sounds and carried them
beyond human hearing.
Wandesford sat near her in the orange
bower, the only one there whose sensation
was not unmixed delight: his senses were
indeed intranced, but his heart, or his
passions rather, were agitated almost to
frenzy: one moment he viewed her with
rapture, the next almost with hatred, and
the elegant but haughty politeness which
marked her manner when she spoke to
him mortified him more than the most
obvious displeasure.
As the saffron light of an Italian sud-
rise broke on the garden, Wandesford
retired, repeating to himself :"She is a
woman, therefore must be wooed ; she is a
woman, therefore
may
be won."
The moment that the intense heat of
the following day rendered visiting prac-
ticable, Wandesford flew to the villa of
Lord Montclare. In the portico all was
silent and solitary: with difficulty he
procured admission. An old female

“ Where are Lord Montclare and bis

“ This morning, signor, they quitted
Naples on their way to France, from
thence they propose to visit England, but
never will return to Italy.",
Wandesford in silence returned to
Naples.

M. MAINTENOX.
ARMIDA IN ENGLAND,
For several days Wandesford remain-
ed in a state of reverie : at first he ima.
gined the impression would wear off, and
his pride for a moment encouraged him
in this hope ; but after a few days ex-
perience of that silent and restless tor-
ment, which a spirit too proud for com-
munication, and too impetuous for re-
straint, feels when compelled to suffer,
he determined to pursue her in spite of
rejection.
The restraints of his profession were
soon removed by his interest and con-
nexions, and taking advantage of the
peace, he arrived in Paris, without a
hint escaping him of the object of his

expedition. His first inquiry was for
Lord Montclare. On learning that his
lordship and Miss Fitzalban had quitted
Paris about a week before for England,
bis natural impatience broke out into
fury, and be execrated Armida and her
father with as much rage as if their
invitation had brought him to France:
but a few moments convinced him that
the absence of this extraordinary female,
whom he alternately seemed to love and
hate, rendered France as insupportable as
Italy, 'and he resolved to follow her to
Eogland, almost with a sentiment of re-
venge in the pursuit.
In the meantime Armida had been
hurried by her father through Italy and
France, without explanation, and almost
without rest. Long accustomed to his
sudden movements and rapid journeys,
she felt little surprise at being compelled
to quit Italy the morning after the
splendid fête at Naples ; but she was
terrified at the paroxysms, almost amount-

ing to insanity, with which her father
was visited during their progress, and
this mystery of her fate, into which she
had never inquired, seemed already to
menace existence with future storms, like
those dark spots which in the brilliant
atmosphere of the west portend the ap-
proaching vengeance amid sun-shine and
security.
It was an auspicious period for her
arrival in France. Paris was just then
filled with the plunder of Italy: her
galleries groaned with the weight of
their paintings, their statues, and their
busts: every where were scattered io-
scriptions unexplored, and antiqués un-
defined: literature, furniture, women,
every thing at Paris was a la grecq.
Armida's form revived all the images of
classic beauty: Armida's songs recalled
all the wonders of the classic fables :
Armida's genius realized the glories of
classic, antiquity ; but though delighted
by the applauses she met in France, her

English mind and character were revolt-
ed by their frivolity, and from every
other sentiment but admiration she re-
treated with precipitation.
But it was with strong emotion she
prepared to visit England; the country
of her ancestors, the country of her birth,
the country where the mind, alike of man
and woman, neither shackled by slavery
or distorted by superstition, is permitted
to attain its full growth, and appear in its
grandest dimensions.
She arrived, tremblingly alive with the
tumult of pride and hope, of ambition
and solicitude: she had heard that the
English were a 'reserved, phlegmatic
people, slow in recognizing genius, and
cautious in distributing praise.
But conscious of her powers, she col-
lected them with confidence, enlarged her
acquaintance with English literature, but
awaited in a kind of silent inspiration the
signal to run her race of glory on a wider
plain,and before moreillustrious witnesses.

But what was the astonishment, the
horror, of the beautiful, intelligent, and
ambitious foreigner, on her first introduc-
tion to fashionable life in London: lost
amid a crowd wbere beauty could not be
distinguished ; stunned by a buz of
nothings, where mind could not be dis-
played'; elbowed by rouged, naked, dash-
ing dowagers; suffered to stand unnoticed,
or eyed through a glass by yawning,
lounging bucks of ton; sinking amid
the crowd, to be permitted to help her-
self to refreshments, or to want them; to
be without conversation, though a mis-
tress of half the dead and living lan-
guages, from her ignorance of fashionable
jargon; to walk down a set with a part-
ner who appeared to be debating whether
it would not be high ton to drop asleep
during the exercise-what a reception
for a woman who had seen at her feet
Italy and France contending to scatter
the laurels of fame and the roses of
pleasure. At first she shrunk back

almost in terror, till her pride came to her
relief, and she determined to display her
talents in spite of rudeness or apathy, for she
still believed she had only to display them
to command in a moment that admiration
of which the absence was insupportable,
though while possessing it she had felt
its emptiness. But she soon found it
was not to gaze on beauty and grace, or
to listen to eloquence and harmony, that
the fashionable crowds of London were
collected. In a crowded ball-room she
could not display the various phases of
her beautiful figure, which required
rather - a theatre than an assembly for
their exhibition. When she sung, the rage
of gaming abated for a moment in the
adjacent rooms; but after a few stares
and bravos, the conversation turned on
Moore's Ballads, or Braham's Anglo-
Italian songs. The connoisseurs indeed
-applauded, but not like the coppoisseurs of
Italy: there was no suspended respiration,
no uplifted eyes, no outspread hands, as

if to support her in her ærial flights :
nothing of that enthusiasm which gives
the performer the powers it applauds.
Her paiutings gave still less delight, for
still fewer are judges of good painting
than of good music, and to herself they
seemned as if their colours had darkened
since she brought them from Italy. Her
beauty was indeed admired by al, and
her taste in drapery admitted to be ex-
quisite; but still she looked like none of
the women of the day: her fantastic ele-
gance was more the result of taste than
of prescription: she wanted the uniform
of the corps of fashion, that identity of
costume wbich for a season transforms
the whole female world into the represen-
tation of one figure.
When she attempted to collect around
her an intellectual circle, the diffidence
of her first repulse still sat heavy on her
spirits, and she felt the difference be-
tween addressing foreigners, superficial,
ardent, and fond of admiring, and Engr

Her thoughts, her language, became con-

might avoid bursting into tears. In
those moments of dejection, amazed and
shocked at the change in her existence,
she began to fear that her faculties were
impaired, and terrified by this apprehen-
sion, the brilliant and haughty Armida

suddenly became the most reserved and
timid of her sex.
It was at this period that Wandesford
arrived in England, still eager in the
pursuit that had led him from Naples to
London : he expected to see the same
splendid and commanding character that
he had beheld at the Italian fête, whose
scenes still floated before him like the
visions of enchantment. What was his
astonishment at being shewn into a
crowded assembly, where all was gaming,
frenzy, and riot; females fainting ;
beside ice-eating beaux, a chaos of roug-
ed wrinkles, opera hats, quizzing glasses,
and gossamor drapery. Armida, alone,
unattended, unadmired, addressed by no
tongue, defended by no arm from the
crowd that bore her on like an uprooted
flower in a boisterous flood, seeming from
her beauty, and from her loneliness feel-
ing like the inhabitant of another world.
Wandesford paused to assure himself that
it was she herself whom he saw. He

pressed through the crowd to join her:
there was an independence in her thus
refusing to compromise her superiority
for the frivolity of fashion that made
her more congenial than ever to the pride
and hauteur of Wandesford. He re-
mained near her the wbele evening : her
character developed itself more fully to
him ; and his mind, well worn as it was
with the objects of the world, was
strongly excited by one so new._A young
female, so beautiful, so highly endowed, the
so ambitiously conscious of genius, so
tremblingly alive to fame, yet so shaded in
by melancholy, and a kind of proud de-
jection, like that of an abdicated
monarch, turning forth the silver lining
of her sable cloud of sadness every mo-
ment, and gladdening the spectator with 32
unexpected brightness, then again re-
treating behind it, as if she mocked their
admiration and her own lustre.

himself was not insensible of the pleasure
of having all bis faculties called out, and
tasked to support a conference with a
beautiful female hardly twenty. Ar-
mida’s refulgent eyes flashed with the
fire of awakened genius once more, and
when they turned to him they shone
through the brilliant dews of grateful
sensibility. She was grateful for his at-
tention, and, accustomed only to praise,
felt herself involuntarily revived by his:
she felt the pleasure of having a com-
papion in the crowded solitude of a
fashionable party : when she spoke it was
with the certainty of one delighted
listener, and when she sung she could
distinguish the rapturous applause of
Wandesford. Vanity and interest ena-
bled Wandesford to act the part of an as-
siduous lover for a whole winter, in spite
of his patural indolence and selfish sur-
liness: at the end of that period he
offered her his hand in the most timid
language of respectful adoratiep.

Lord Montclare eagerly accepted his
proposal, and urged them on his daugh-
ter with an importunity scarce inferior to
that of Wandesford himself. ' Importun.
ed, flattered, persecuted, by Wandesford,
her father, and the eternał monk, she
consented ; but as she pronounced the
words, a coldness, like that of death,
seemed to seize on her heart, and amid
Wandesford's raptures she shocked him
by bursting into tears. Lord Montclare,
who had only waited her decision, im-
mediately announced to Armida and
Wandesford that their marriage should
'take place in Ireland, where he purposed
going in a few days, and spending, he
added in a faltering voice, the remainder
of his days. Accustomed as Armida was
to fly from one region to another, she
trembled at the thoughts of the savage
country she was to visit. Wandesford,
who was anxious for the eclat of his
marriage, suppressed his murmurs with
difficulty, but at length it was arranged

to Connaught, where Lord Montclare's
estate lay, and receive the hand of Ar-

of the Atlantic,

ARMIDA IN IRELAND.
The next day at an early hour Lord
Montclare and his daughter quitted Lon-
dop: the pomp and tumult of the equi-
page, the crowd of servants, and the speed
of their journey, as if they were flying
to some region of happiness, formed a
strange contrast to the gloom and de-
jection of the travellers. Accustomed
only to the eclat of a capital, and to pass
from one scene of luxury to another,
Armida felt a desolation of heart at the

prospect of the Irish journey she had
never known before.
She supk back in the carriage, and
covering her face with her handkercbief,
resigned herself almost to despair. From
the moment of their arrival in Ireland
Lord Montclære's spirits seemed to re-
vive, and at the close of the third day's
journey, as Armida, exhausted with
fatigue and dejection, sat with her eyes
fixed on the bleak waste of bog, scarce
seen through the rain that beat heavily
against the carriage windows, Lord
Montclare suddenly said :-
“ Do you know, Armida, that you
have relations in Ireland ?"
- Have I, my lord," was the answer,
and nothing more was said for two hours :
Lord Montclare then, apparently forc-
ing himself to proceed, added :-
- Yes you have, and it is necessary
you
should know something about
them."
Armida appeared to listen, and her

father, with many pauses of strong
emotion, informed her that the estate in
Ireland had been purchased from a ruin-
ed Milesian family ; that going thirty
years ago to take possession, his sister,
who accompanied him, had unfortunate-
ly become attached to the son of the
ancient proprietor, whom he described as
living among his tenants in all the pride,
poverty, and sloth, of a true Milesian ; .
that immediately on her disgraceful
marriage she had been renounced not
only by her own family, but by her
husband's father, who was irreparably
offended at his son marrying the sister
of the man whom he considered rather as
the usurper than the purchaser of his
property.
"I quitted Ireland immediately," con-
tinued Lord Montclare, “and the first
notice I ever took of them since was in
consequence of a letter I received from
my unfortunate sister about a year ago,
upon her death-bed : bad I pot known

the circumstances under which it was
written I would never have perused it.
She described the misery in which she
and her husband had liógered through
many years of indigence, the loss of most
of their children through actual want of
sustenance : she entreated my compassion
for her wretched husband, who had
fallen into the lowest habits of dissolute
poverty, and my protection for her two
surviving children, whom she described
as kneeling, scarcely clad, beside her
dying bed of straw.”
· Armida shuddered.
“ My resentment was appeased,” con-
tinued her father. " I wrote to Ireland
to inquire about them: I learned that
the old sayage had taken bis eldest
grandson to starve with him amid the
ruins of his castle, that the second was
running wild about the bogs in the
neighbourhood, and that their father
was living with any of the tenants who
could afford to share the shelter of their

pize him as my brother-in-law, or them
as my nephews, I did not wish to be in-

went to Italy to join Wandesford's regi-
ment, in which I got him a commission.

don; he came one morning into the libra-
ry to thank me. I dismissed him as soon
as possible. His likeness to his mother

Lord Montclare viewed his daughter
well for a moment, but he perceived she
was speaking with her imagination, not
her feeling : she was thinking more of
the picture than of the man; yet it struck
him that the removal of his nephew was
not improvident, and that the figure of
this forlorn boy might in solitude have
recalled the images of classic beauty too
strongly to Armida's imagination. Lord
Montclare then pursued bis invectives
against the pride and insolence of the
old savage grandfather, the dissolute ab-
jectness of the son, and the poverty of
the grandsons, for it appeared that he
had no other crime to object to these
desolate young men. Armida mused in
silence on the picture, drawn by a rough,
unfavourable hand as it was: it was the
first subject that occupied her mind
during the journey; the inflexible pride
and high-thoughted poverty of the old

almost servile, within the walls of which
he was born to be the master; and the
two youths, her cousins, nursed amid the
strife of pride and want, so favourable to
the romantic spirit that appeases the tale

seat till it smells beyond it, and stands ''s
forth amid the fragments dilated and re-
vealed, terrifying the intrusion of modern
usurpers. Again she thought of the
elder brother, who persisted in remaining
with his grandfather : the image had
struck her-a young man thus clinging li
with romantic attachment, with ancient
duty, to an aged relative in want and je
abasement, in solitude and sorrow, wast-

Again she inquired about this eldest son.
Her father could tell her no more: he
only knew that he had resisted the impor-
tunities of his father and brother to quit
his grandfather, and share with them the
protection of Lord Montclare. He was
proud, solitary, and repulsive, and de-
clined all assistance from the gentlemea
of the country.
“Such is the family," said Lord Mont-
clare," with whom till to-day yon knew
not your relationship.”
" And was it for the purpose of recog-
nizing it your lordship took the trouble
of coming to Ireland ?” said Armida.
No, not for that purpose, not altoge-
ther. The purpose for which I came to
Ireland is not yet to be told,” said Lørd
Montclare, with strong emotion. It was
upobserved by Armida, for at that mo-
ment the view opening on the sea drew
even from her a cry of admiration,

deurdark, desolate, and stormy gran-

winds, dashed its grey waves along a
line of rocky coast with a violence that
seemed even in the absence of a storm to
announce perpetual war and unexhausted
winter. The dark clouds, though they

part of the rock it stood on.
A solitary
tower or two, perched on a bare rock,
and a few islands near the shore, appeared
to be contending for their existence amid
the loud and restless war of waters.
To Armida, accustomed only to the
sunny regions of Italy, or the cultivated
fields of England, the effect of such a
scene was like that of a new world. She
shuddered at the idea of becoming the
inhabitant of such a country; and she
thought she felt already the wild trans-
forming effect of its scenery.
As the carriages wound along the steep
road the castle rose to her view, a rude,
shapeless, wide-spreading structure, the
work of different ages : part of it had
been repaired for their reception : yet it
still retained its old and warlike charac-
ter, its bastions hoary with the foam of
the sea, and its battlements that seemed
fit for the nests of eagles. As they passed

strewn with fragments of its once embat-
tled wall, Armida, looking backward on
the precipice on whose very edge it stood,
saw far below a number of people on a
rock. Through the strait between them,
steep and narrow, the sea rushed with a
violence that whitened the cliffs to their
summit: yet they stood, and Armida
could perceive that their looks were fixed
intently on the train that was entering
the castle. At this moment the servants
gathered round the carriage with looks
of fear, and Lord Montclare learned
from them with difficulty that the group
consisted of the old Irish prince, support-
ed by his grandson, and still attended by
a few followers, who stood there to take
a last view of their ancient seat, from
which the arrival of the new possessor
had excluded them for ever. Lord
Montclare, throwing himself back in the
carriage, impatiently bid them drive on:

low. Lord Montclare and his daughter
shuddered, and scarcely thought them-
selves safe within their castle. It was a
sound that expressed all the wild feelings
of a savage people, mixed with grief,
despair, and agonized attachment. The
rocks, the towers, and the shores rung
again. The spirited horses that drew
the carriage became terrified and ungo-
vernable in a moment, and tormented by
the broken pavement, they reared back-
vard, till the carriage, driven beyond
the arch, hung on the edge of the preci-
pice. Lord Montclare, leaping out, call-
ed on his servants to assist his daughter,
in vain: the horses wheeliog round, be-
gan to gallop down the precipice with
frightful fury.
Armida beheld her death inevitable;
but at the moment she
gave herself

figure darted from the opposite rock, and
approached on the very side of danger

with a rapidity almost equal to that with
which she was whirled along. Her ima.
gigation full of terror, she thought that
the Irish prince was rushing forward to
seize and dash her from the precipice;
and as the figure approached she scream-
ed aloud to him to spare her life. Her
senses failed her when she felt him snatch
her from the carriage through the door,
which was still opens nor did she recover
them until she found herself in her fa.

lection of a tall figure bending over her,
and a long curl of raven hair touching
her cheek as in a dream. She tremblingly
inquired how she had been preserved, and
learned that when ber danger had driven
even her father to a distance, the man
who she supposed meant to murder had
saved her life at the hazard of his own,
in and after supporting her in his arms till
her servants thought it safe to approach

much swiftness as he flew to save her.
No one knew who he was, but from his
silence, his figure, and a romantic dress
which none of them could describe, all
concluded him to be the grandson of the
old Milesian.
As Armida, pale and exhausted, was
borne once more through the court by the
servants, at a frightful distance below
she saw the mangled horses wallowing
amid the fragments of the carriage from
which she had been snatched but a few
moments before it was dragged down the
precipice : again she fainted, and was
carried insensible to her apartment.

It was midnight before Armida was
restored to perfect recollection. Broken,
uneasy slumbers followed her swoons :
at length she started up, and looked
around her. The splendid furniture
which Lord Montclare had ordered from
England was not yet arrived, and the
apartment she was in bore the aspect of
preceding centuries : its dark spacious-
ness, its wainscotting of oak black as
ebony, its coved ceiling, and huge win-
dows with small dim panes, were scarcely
seen by the lights that burned on a table
of black marble beside her bed. Her
foreign servants were sitting pale and
aghast by an immense turf fire that burn-

ed on the hearth, for grates were un-
known in this Irish castle.
Armida inquired for her father : he
had retired to rest, “ And so have all the
people in the castle," said the women,
"except ourselves.”
“ Has every one retired ?" cried Ar-
mida, listening " What noise is that I
hear then, so deep, and so continued ?"
“ It is the noise of the sea,” said the
women : "the tide is coming in, and the
waves they say often dash against the walls
of this melancholy old castle.”
Armida dismissed her attendants, who,
wearied by their journey, gladly retired.
She tried to compose herself to rest: it
was impossible: her mind was agitated
- by the events of the day. She rose, and
going to the huge casement, which re..
quired all her strength to open, threw
herself on a seat beside it. All was still,
dark, and vast. No sight of human habita-
tion, no sound of human life--the sky, the
rocks, the ocean, and the moon-nothing

else above or below. Heg mind was awed
into a kind of passiveness that resembled
repose; and though chilled by the night
breeze, she continued to gaze on, till she
saw a figure moving on the rocks below.
It approached till nearly opposite her
casement. Neither shape nor dress were
T
distinguishable ; but the stature appear:
ed more than human.
A thousand gloomy thoughts of Irish
atrocity rushed into her mind-What if
the Milesian prince or his grandson were
come to curse the usurpers of their cas-
tle by the only light their pride would
permit them to view its alienated walls I
by! For a moment she thought of call-
ing for assistance, till the recollection
that she knew nothing of the immense edi-
fice she was in checked her. She watch-
ed the figure in silence. In a few mi-
nutes she saw another approach, whose
stooping frame and feeble steps marked
extreme age.
Armida could not distins
guish his motions, but in a few moments !!

she heard the sound of an instruments
faint, tremulous, and wild. It was the
Irish harp, touched by a native on his
own wild shores, and accompanied by a
voice, which, though broken by age,
sounded like music in despair. The
taller figure threw himself at his length
on the rock, and seemed to listen to for-
getfulness. The instrument was defec-
tive, and the hand of the performer weak
with age; but Armida forgot all science
while she listened to him, and felt the
effect of the scenery united with the
sound.
The music, though unlike
any
she had
ever praised as excellent, had a charm
superior to that excellence: it had a cha-
racter impossible to define, but impossi-
ble to resist: it appealed from rules to
the heart, and its simplicity made the
appeal resistless, as the inarticulate ery
of infancy affects more deeply than the
utmost eloquence of distress.

of Italian melody, wept as she listened to
the rude song of the Irish bard. Once,
oppressed by a variety of emotions, she
sobbed aloud. The tall figure started,
and turned at the sound, and then hastily
retired with his companion. At that
moment the moon shone bright on the
rock, and she distinguished the figure.
It was the young Milesian, who had
wandered forth under the shadow of his
hereditary walls, attended by his bard,
to listen to tales of other days, and feed
his soul with visions of pride and me-
lancholy.
“ Strange, inconsistent being !” said
Armida : “ he can hazard his life for a
stranger; he can feast on the luxuries of
midnight music ; and he flies from the
sound of gratitude or sympathy.".
She felt no wish to remain at the case-
ment after he was gone, and retired to
bed, which she did not quit till sum-
moned to dinner on the following day.
As she entered the room, she observed at

oned to her by the name of Mr. Randall
O'Morven, and whom from his conversa-
tion she soon discovered to be her uncle.
Neither his past distress, the coldness of
Lord Montclare, or the degradation of
taking his place under the roof he was
born to inherit as a kind of upper servant
to its present possessor, appeared to make
the least impression on this man, who pos-
séssed the worst kind of Irish character, a
character of unfeeling, unworthy self-en-
joyment, not destitute of affection, but
wholly without dignity. He talked,
laughed, ate and drank, with a vulgar
ease, and seemed to forget both his father
and his children, till Lord Montclare
happened to mention his second son, who
was in Wandesford's regiment, and with
it was daily expected in Ireland.

fellow is brave enough, but then so wild
and so proud, that I'll engage he never
stayed so much as to be thanked for it.
Why you might as well get a word from
one of those goats that are scampering
on the cliffs there ; and he is just as mute
and as active as them. Why now, your

within these walls since your lordship
purchased them : and, simple as you
sit
there, my lord, he considers you as an
usurper of bis natural rights, and would
scorn to eat the bread from your hand

Armida, wearied and shocked, now
rose to withdraw one of the windows of
the great Gothic hall in which they
dined, opening on a terraced rock that
had formerly been one of the ramparts of
the castle. She wandered along it till
she reached a flight of steps, which, after
many windings, led to the shore, and when

the tide was in were often covered with

was now dry, the evening calm though
gloomy, the heavy clouds level with the
horizon. She walked on till she reached
a solitary rock, covered with mosses,
shells, and
spars,
whose
green
and spark-
ling beauty amid such solitude made it
seem like the throne of the spirit of the
waters. Here she sat, and for some
hours sunk into the deep absence of mind,
that, though it precludes reflection, does
pot shut out pain.
The strange destiny that in the space
of a year had changed a brilliant native
of Italy, surrounded by crowds, Aattery,
and intellectual luxury, into a solitary
wanderer on the rude and barren shores
of Ireland, seemed to chill her very mind.
Her thoughts did not move; they lay
under the load : urged by the pressure,
her mind at length recurred to the image
of Wandesford as the companion of her
future life, as the only resource that pre-

sented itself to her imagination, wrested
from all its usual objects. It was then
she discovered the secret of her heart.
His image was not the image to which
the mind delights to turn in solitude,
She thought of him with complete apa-
thy, and in the desolation of her heart
wept aloud. The encreasing murmurs
of the sea at length aroused her. She
looked round. During her long reverie,
the tide coming rapidly in, already sur-
rounded her, and completely intercepted
her return to the shore she had quitted.
In the first confusion of her fear she
escaped through a shallow water to a
rock, on which it bad not yet encroach-
ed, but gazing round, she saw with terror
the one she had quitted in a few 'mo-
ments covered by the waves, which now
almost rose to the summit of that she
stood on: every other between her and
the shore had disappeared, and the castle
itself scarcely showed its dim towers
through the twilight, darkened as it was

by a gathering storm. The terror of her
situation every moment encreased. The
waves, though not deep, would have com-
pletely exhausted her strength in the at-
tempt to wade through them. The hol-
low sweeping of the surge mocked every
effort to be heard at that distance. The
waves already reached her feet, though
she had retreated to the highest point of
the rock that yet remained uncovered,
and their sullen sound as they reached
her seemed to announce that their next
summons would not be in vain.
Gloomy as life had appeared but a
moment before, the thoughts of death,
and of such a death, were beyond expres-
sion horrible. She exerted her utmost
strength to scream for assistance, and
waved the sbawl she had thrown over
her; but the echo and the wind seemed
to sport with them only to aggravate her
despair.
Far to the left there was a chain of
rocks, stretching to the shore; but to

reach them was impossible; yet she con-
tinued to gaze on them as if they could
help her, when she suddenly descried a
figure bounding along them from point
to point with an activity and force that
seemed more than human. Strong as
was her wish for life, the darkness, the
perfect silence, the super-human speed
of this figure, terrified her, and she
shrieked, as plunging from the nearest
point of the rock he swam towards her,
with a bold and rapid arm, and the next
moment ascended the crag, where she
still clung, caught her in his arms, and
while she despaired of life, placed her
beyond the reach of danger. They were
still, however, far from the castle; but
neither rocks nor waves seemed to im
pede her preserver, who darted on with
a speed that even terrified her, though it
saved her.
They were now within a short distance
of the castle, when Armida at once felt
the necessity of thanking the stranger,

and felt she was unable to do so: his
silence, his repulsive character, and the
circumstances of terror and danger under
which she had twice met him (for she
knew it was the young Milesian), awed
and depressed her. Eloquent and po-
lished as she was, she felt all the embar-
rassment of ignorance; and the strong
pulsation of his heart, which she felt dis.
tinctly while in his arms, whether caused
by emotion or speed, seemed to commu-
nicate its agitation to ber own.
In the
confusion she produced her purse, and
timidly offered it to his acceptance. It
was dark, and as the stranger stood at
some distance from her, she did not see
the haughtiness with which he retreated
from her. She followed him, and only
remembering his poverty, repeated her
request.
“ I am an O'Morven," said the young
man, proudly, " of a race, who, though
they have nothing now to bestow, have
not yet learned how to receive. To me

an act of humanity is no effort, nor could
I risk any thing of less value to me than
life.”
Armida, now insulted in her turn, hur.
ried with faltering steps to the castle,
from which the servants had been dis-
patched in every direction in quest of
her; and when she reached her apartment
dismissed her terrified attendants, who
crowded round ber, unwilling to betray
the conflict of emotions that divided her
mind.
“ Let him go,” said she, at length,
when she found herself alone; "the
proud savage; let him go, since his pride
can thus insult those whom his courage
and his humanity astonish and subdue.
How he tried to degrade the effort he had
made, that he might degrade the object
of it: it was mere humanity, and I was
of no more value in his eyes than a
perishing mendicant: it was not so in
Italy.” And the tears of pride and anger
gushed fast from her eyes.

harmony of his voice, though she had
heard it in anger, came to her ear in the
pauses of the storm that bowled round
the castle, and when she rose, she deter-

Wandesford, that she might exclude the
thoughts that filled her mind too much
with the stranger. The next day, how-
ever, the visits of the neighbourhood,
whom curiosity had rendered impatient
to see her, left her not a moment's leisure.
The impressions which she gave and re-
ceived will be best described by the fol-
lowing letters, the first of which was
written by an ancient dowager, who re-
sided a few miles from the castle.

words for the music. You will think
me an enthusiast, dear uncle, but unless I
wrote in poetry I cannot describe the
etherial goddess-like character of her
beauty, yet I cannot tell the peculiar
charm that affects you: she has no natural
colour, no vivacity, she speaks little, and
her dress was the simplest in the room.
She was in white muslin, but she had
some rich ornaments on her arms and
neck, and the beauty of her dark hair,
the taste with which it was arranged, and
her light dress, that seemed like drapery
thrown over a statue, gave a kind of poe-

tical character to her figure that made it
hardly seem'substantial. Just opposite to
us Lady Gabriella was seated ; beautiful
indeed, and glowing with youth and
spirits, but with her showy vivacity, her
high complexion, and all the colours of
Flora or Pomona in her dress : what a
contrast to the Doric graces of Armida.
She spoke but little, and only to me: her
manners though cold are exquisitely
polished, and they have a commanding
ease, which, though the result of pride,
gives her hearer a kind of confidence. In
the evening there was some general
conversation, and literature was men-
tioned: then at length she spoke, and
though evidently with no effort, it still
seemed painful to her reserve and
languor. After much importunity sbe

ignorance of foreign music, for though
some passages made me shiver, and some
made me weep, I felt I was not judge
enough to appreciate the powers she
displayed. In some parts of her voice I
felt as if I was mounting a precipice
with her, and grew bewildered and giddy
with the difficulties of the way: after
all, there was one low and simple song, ba
which a connoisseur would laugh if he
heard me say I preferred, but it came. he
over me like moonlight after the glare he
of a burning day, and drew from me the sho

« But not for all her talents would I
feel the lassitude with which she retired
to her seat, and seemed by some strange
exemption to be the only one there who
could give delight, but who could not
feel it. She has been destroyed by flat-
tery, intellectual luxury, and a too strong
and too early excitement of her sensibi-
lity, that like a flower' torn open in the
bud, has withered before it has blown.

After her performance, think, my dear
uncle, of Lady Gabriella singing, and
exhibiting her wretched drawings, which
Lady Kilcarrick had brought in the car-
riage. Armida listened, and looked with
painful politeness: her mind is too great
for ridicule, or she might bave 'fooled
them to the top of their bent,' but she
has no female littleness of heart: if her
character was more common she might
be more bappy: she must have thought
both music and drawings execrable, but
she bowed and was silent: after her,
what followed was to me insupportable;
and while the company were occupied
with Lady Gabriella's portfolio, I was
examining Armida's beautiful paintings
with which the room was filled, till I
was afraid of suggesting an invidious
comparison to them; and taking a book
that lay on one of the tables, I retired to
a little boudoir where the scent of the
orange-flowers invited me, and forgotten
by all, forgot myself, till I heard Miss

an
Fitzalban's voice, who had entered the
boudoir alone, inquiring what employed
me so intently. At first I was going to
shut the book ; but the next moment,
urged by an impulse for which I could
not account, I gave it to her, and pointed
out the very passage I was reading. It
was in the Adventurer, the beautiful tale
of Almerine and Shelimah: But Al-
merine, whom ambition was thus ready
to obey, who was reverenced by hoary
wisdom, and beloved by youthful beauty,
was perhaps the most wretched of her
sex. Perpetual adulation had made her
haughty and proud : her penetration and
delicacy rendered almost every object of-
fensive. She was disgusted with imper-
fections which others could not disco-

After giving her the
book, I stood before her trembling like a
criminal before a judge. I felt I had
behaved with unpardonable audacity ac-
cording to common rules. She read the
passage through with an unbreken voice,

and then returned the book to me...
• The voice of sincerity ought to be
pleasing to me,' said she, from its no-
velty, for from my birth till now I believe
I have never heard it. You must stay
with me. I need not ask you to be my
friend, for that you have dared to be al-
ready in the lesson you have given me to-
night.' Whether my late temerity had
exhausted me I cannot tell, but I made
po opposition. Lady Kilcarrick gave an
ungracious assent, and I have since re-
mained at the castle. I know not yet
how I feel, or what to think of my situa-
tion. At times the superiority of her
character overpowers and dazzles me, and
at others her habitual lassitude and me,
lancholy places me a thousand degrees
above her in the scale of happiness. Lord
Montclare is sufficiently 'polite, and any
other female humble as I am would be
happy; yet at times, my dear 'uncle, I

"I am now sitting in a turret of this
ancient castle : the waves of the Atlantic
are roaring around me : the grey clouds
are sailing above my head. I see nothing
but the foam, that rises to the very case-
ment: I hear nothing but the whistling
wind and the solitary scream of the sea-
fowl. In the calmest day the wind is
heard loudly among these rocks, and
through the long passages of the castle.
Sometimes the sun breaks out for a mo-
ment, and sheds a green light on the dis-
tant grassy hills, like a ray of imagination
playing on a withered heart; but I see
far off the sweeping shadows of the
clouds, that come to extinguish it, and
feel it gone before it disappears. This
solitude might be favourable to deep re-
flection, but I have so much real melano
choly in my heart I am afraid to think.
In Italy, amid her roseate landscapes and
purpureal lights, I often indulged a lux-
urious melancholy, because amid such
scenes there was no danger in the indul.

brilliant picture that was before me. But
here there is no contrast between my
mind and my situation, and I feel like an
enchantress who has gone beyond her
circle, and dreads to raise the spirits
she can no longer govern.
6 Yet here I have met with a character
that has to alliance with the climate, a
young female, whose constant and natu-
ral animation I admire, even more than
the sincerity and simplicity of her cha-
racter. I am amazed at the perseverance
with which she reads, works, and sings,
without any excitement, any impulse of
flattery or imagination ; how she flies
over the rocks for exercise, and catches
spirits from the breeze, whose coldness
seems to chill my very mind. While
reading only plunges me into reverie, and
music bring's images to 'me, like those of
a dream, which I try in vain to define,

never has ventured to play or sing for
company in her life. Her talents are
mediocre: a thousand times a day I feel
the superiority of my mind to her's, but
what avails a superiority that does not
procure happiness.
I am convinced I am an object of com-
passion to her-have Ithen been mistaken,
Wandesford, or have those who made me
what I am been mistaken in their esti-
mate of life ? Are genius and imagination
the enemies of happiness? Does intellec-
tual luxury debilitate and disease the
mind as it does the frame? If it be so, if
I must die of this atrophy of the heart,
let me not die here at least. In that
happy climate, whose luxuries feast both
the heart and the senses, where the sink-
ing column is hid with roses, and the
brilliant air at once breathes melody and
perfumes, there let me resign an existence
which the talents that could not adorn
máy perhaps commemorate, and to which
the sensibility that has destroyed it

enough to compensate its loss."
Twice, on finishing her letter, Armida

young Milesian, for she felt it like a
breach of confidence to Wandesford to
say nothing of the man of whom she
thought so much, but she found her.

finished, the castle clock struck three,
and she was preparing to retire to rest,
when she heard the trampling of horses
on the rocky road that wound under her
apartment, and the next moment the
heavy jarring of the great gates, as they
were slowly unclosed by the half-wakened
domestics. Surprised by the arrival of
any one at so late an hour, she hastened
into the gallery, and at the opposite end
of the vast hall into which it opened
saw a figure in a military dress pass to
Lord Montclare's apartment.
" It is
young Mr. O'Morven, madam,” said the
servants, who saw her leaning from the

arrival of Colonel Wandesford : the regi-
ment has come to Ireland. Mr. O'Morven
came with the first detachment, and the
colonel will be here in a few days.”
“ Wandesford here in a few days !”. re-
peated Armida mechanically.” A chill
like that of death came over her, and at
that moment the monotonous existence
of which she had been complaining in
ber letter appeared happiness compared
to the event of Wapdesford's arrival.
She remained for several minutes clinging
to the gallery, as if it could have pro-
tected her from her own thoughts, till
the approach of a quick light step re-
called her to herself: it was young
O'Morven, followed by his father, who
was persuading him not to quit the castle
at so late an hour. The young man
gently but firmly declined his father's
importunities, who retired in some dis-
pleasure, and Armida then recognised
the sunny locks, the heaven blue eyes

th
and the dazzling and etherial bloom of
the figure she had once seen in London.
In the dim light in which sbe stood he
could ouly discover it was a female, and
he bowed to her with an air in which
military pride was mixed with youthful
humility. As she bowed to him, she
could not help contrasting his youth,
spirit, and softness, with the gloomy pride
of his brother, and she inquired of the
domestics, who were still in the hall, why
he quitted the castle at so late an hour.
“ To visit his brother." " Visit his bro-
ther at this hour !” repeated Armida.
“ It is the only hour they can meet,” said
an Irish seryant: “ the old grandfather
wou't suffer the eldest to set foot within
these walls, nor the youngest to come
near the old ruin where he lives himself,
so the poor lads can only get sight of each
other by night, on the bare rocks, and it
is there they will meet now.” In the
meantime, Desmond O'Morven was tra-
versing the sea-worn path that led from

the castle to the lonely tower where his
brother resided. From the period that
his father and he had put themselves
under the protection of Lord Montclare
his implacable grandfather had forbid the
brothers to meet, and confined the elder
almost entirely to the ruin in which they
resided, The night was dark, and the
rough, wind dashed the spray of an ebbing
tide across his path at every step; but to
Desmond the way was marked by traces
he had never forgotten. He climbed the
rude natural steps that led to the tower
with a beating heart. On a crag of the
rock, against which the waves were
beating their white foam, scarce visible
from time to time in the moon, whose
pale, and watery ray touched his form
with something like a supernatural light,
stood Coppal O'Morven. The brothers
rushed to each other's arms; but when
Connal felt the weak and trembling frame
of his brother, and remembered his re-
cent wounds in Italy, he reproached

one as bleak and comfortless as himself:
one who has not even a roof to lead you
under; who has nothing but a bare arm
to shelter you.” " It was to feel that
arm folded round me,” said Desmond,
" that I quitted a roof where, except
that, I bad not a wish ungratified."
“Sit on this stone, at least,” said Con-
pal, “it is all I have to offer you. This
is a desolate meeting," said he, as he
placed himself between Desmond and the
cold wind: “I cannot even see your
face: the moon has set, and I long to see
it. I long to feel the recollections which
your voice and your touch has awakened
confirmed by your looks." “ They are
much changed,” said Desmond in an
altered voice : “ I am not the wild rustic
that I was, buroing with health and spi-
rits; but though the blood has almost
left my cheek, I feel it as warm at my

mond, you soften mine too much,” said
Connal, turning away. Desmond could
not see the wildness of his expression as
he spoke, but he marked the sublime and
daring character of his brother's figure,
as it stood braving the blast like his na-
tive tower that stood in the distance,
dark, and stern, and desolate, Desmond
felt his military enthusiasm revive as he
gazed on him : he rose, and extended to
its full length the giant arm of his bro.
ther that hung on his shoulder.
“ But you are altered, Connal, since we
parted : even by this light I can see how
much you are altered: how tall and strong
you are: I feel myself like a willow be-
side an oak." “ Yes," said Connal, slowly
withdrawing his arm,
but not like the oak; I have grown like
the sea-weed on these rocks, or the foliage
that has spread among the battlements of
that old tower, tall, worthless, and un:
cultivated, to sigh to the blast, and

Connal,” said Desmond,
lancholy language gives me more pain
than my absence from you." "I am
seldom guilty of a murmur,” said Counal,
proudly recollecting himself: “ the only
part left me is that of stern endurance;
yet there are moments, when, pressed by
my hard fate, my heart, like Joseph in
the Bible, amid all his constraint, will
long at the sight of a brother, to fall on
his neck, and even weep there." He threw
himself on Desmond as he spoke, but
Desmond, who was trembling with con-
cealed emotions, eagerly seized on his
brother's words to make a discovery,
which since the first moment of their in-
terview had pressed on his heart like a
crime.
* Yes, Connal, there are such mo-
ments, and such are the present: I long,
and yet I fear.” At the word fear,
Connal gave his brother a look, of which
the other felt the expression, though in

the dark. “I know not what I fear,"
said Desmond, " for I have nothing to
disclose, It began and ended like a
dream, but such a dream, that I could
sleep for ever to have it once more." At
that moment the slow-passing light of a
meteor shewed to Connal his brother's
figure: its youthful perfection, even at
eighteen, and the pale visionary light that
fell op it, gave him an appearance almost
aërial; and though Connalsaw those light,
luxuriant curls of gold, and that waxen
skin, unchanged by war or a foreiga eli-
mate, yet be saw Desmond's bloom was
gone, and there was a voluptuous me-
lancholy in his full blue eyes that spoke
a premature change in his feelings.
Touched by this expression, Conpal spoke
to him in a voice of encouragement, and
Desmond poured out the secret with
which his young heart was full, .

often seen her attendants, but never could
obtain a sight of her or her daughter :
that there was a daughter I was con-
vinced, for sometimes of a mild vight I
saw two figures moving slowly along the
deck, habited apparently alike, and con-
versing in whispers ; and the broken and
mellow murmurs of their harmonious
language, floating on the sea-breeze,
were the pleasantest sounds that ever
came to my ear. Sometimes, but very
rarely, I heard the sound of a musical
instrument coming from their cabin; and
once, very late at night, while gazing at a
beautiful star in the west, that seemed
to shine on my native shore, I heard
voices from below, of such rich, melan-
choly, oppressive sweetness, that I almost
thought as I listened the songs of spirits
floated past me on the waters. A few
nights after, as I was walking op deck,
thinking of all I ever loved, my father
and
you,
I heard a sudden shriek from
the opposite side : I rushed forward, and

heard that some one had fallen overboard.
The vessel was making rapid way; I could
hear or see nothing distinctly, but I
plunged overboard in a moment." Con-
nal pressed his brother's hand with the
silent gratulation of a brave spirit.
“ The object I had rescued was the
daughter of the Italian lady, but the
attendants crowded round us, and she
was taken from my arms the moment I
reached the vessel. I then hurried to my
cabin, where, without taking off my
drenched clothes, or swallowing the spi-
rits the sailors pressed on me, I sat for
hours thinking on the burthen my arms
had just relinquished : it was but for a
moment, and in the darkness and struggle
I had scarce seen her; but I thought the
hand I held for that moment was the
coldest, softest, whitest thing I ever
felt or saw; and the face, as it lay on my
breast for a moment, by the light of a
common lantern, it seemed to have nothing
like life in it, but nothing in life ever

was so lovely. When I thought of tháč
hand touching mine, of that face resting
on my bosom, a strange kind of trembling
seized me : sometimes I wished the whole
scene would occur again, and sometimes
I wished it had never occurred at all.
“ The next and for several days I' was
in a fever, but it was more of mind
than body: every day messages of in-
quiry came from the Italian lady, and
when I recovered, a monk, whom I had
seen among her attendants, came to in-
form me that the signora wished to re-
turn her personal thanks to the preserver
of her child. My breath seemed sus-
pended while he spoke, and after some
Tain attempts to answer, I followed him
to the signora's cabin ; and though I was
disappointed, I was relieved by findiog

" I have seen her,” said Connal.
“ And what do you think of her ?" said.
Desmond, eagerly.
" Why should I think of her ?” said
Condal, evading the question : “ they say

O’Morven buries his blasted youth and

No, my affectionate boy: I sigh not

ARMIDA was awoke the next morning

curtains with looks of terror, exclaimed
that Lord Montclare had passed the
night in agonies, and was now dying.

the sentence: screaming, and almost mad
with horror, she threw on a loose dress,
and flew to her father's apartment; but
he gave positive orders that none. but
bis attendants should be admitted till the

it would be safe for him to see his family.
Accustomed to this exclusion, it gave her
no additional pain, and she now hurried

found in a country so savage. In the dread-
ful interval that preceded their arrival
Armida was almost in despair ; between
her and her father there had never sub.
sisted either the affection of a parent or
the confidence of a child; but he had been
indulgent to her even to profusion, and
his sudden danger, combined with the
desolateness of her situation, and the
reflexion that her talents, though they
gratified his pride, had seldom been ex-
erted for his pleasure, were almost too
much for a mind bitherto untried by cala-
mity: at length the expresses that bad

with their patient. Armida walked up

over she heard an articulate sound ; at
length they came out, and she saw her

the inquiring agony of her silence they
could only answer that Lord Montclare's
disease was the gout; that in consequence
as it appeared of some violent emotion of
mind, it had been driven into his stomach ;
that he was in imminent danger, and the
sooner he saw his family and settled his
worldly concerns the better.
Armida rushed into her father's apart-
ment, which she never quitted till his
sufferings caused her to be carried from
it senseless : it was at this moment she felt
the value of Rosine's inferior character,
while the very impetuosity of her feel-
ing made her mistake every order and
confuse every medicine. Rosine with
steady gentleness palliated the patient's
sufferings even to himself, soothed his
impatience, controuled the distraction of
the attendants, and repressed the execra-
tions that pain every moment forced from
his lips: the paroxysm at length ended
in a deep sleep, such as in those cases
often precedes the approach of death.

not describe pressed on her heart, and
she was involuntarily convinced that her
father's death would be attended with
some terrible discovery.
Sick with unspeakable forebodings,
on returning to her apartment she threw
open her casement for air, and sat beside
it breathless with fear and fancy. It
was now night; all below was dark and
still; nothing was heard but the light
tread of a domestic, or a sound that from
time to time she imagined to be the
moans of her father. About midnight
she was startled by the sound of carri-
ages, horses, and attendants, rapidly driv-
ing into the court of the castle ; her
casement looked into it, and expecting
the arrival of more physicians, she lean-
ed forward: by the light of the flam-
beaux, with which the court was now
illuminated, she saw alight from one of the
carriages Father Morosini, who had left

England; and from another two figures
whom she could not distinguish; a third
carriage was full of female servants; and
a number of attendants, who appeared to
be foreigners, followed them into the
castle. The sound of many steps was
heard passing to Lord Montclare's apart-
ment; the door was then shut, and total
silence followed. No one came near
Armida, who, though wondering, was too
weak to make inquiries, and two hours
elapsed before she was again summoned
to her father. When she entered he was
alone; physicians, attendants, all had re-
tired : the lights were dim, and the
dreadful silence made her almost think
it the chamber of death.
" Come near, Armida, I have a secret
to disclose,” said Lord Montclare; “I
wish you to hear it from no other lips
than mine while they can utter it: you

years

of my son, if, as I believed, I should not
survive the recognition myself. Goaded
by my conscience, my broken health, and
the harassings of Morosini, I determined
on burying myself in Ireland, and making
the discovery in a country where I was
little known, and where the judgment of
my character was indifferent to me from
my contempt for its inhabitants. Here
therefore I came, but when I heard Lady

On quitting her apartment for the first
time, several days after, Armida found a
total change had taken place in the cas-
tle. The Irish and English servants had
been all dismissed, and their places filled
by the foreign domestics who had ac-
companied Lady Montclare: a general
air of constraint perraded the whole
household. Father Morosini appeared
the major-domo again. Mr. O'Morven
retained the situation of agent, and Des-
mond, to whom Lady Montclare was
lavish in her professions of gratitude, was
entreated to continue an inmate of the
castle while his regiment remained in its
neighbourhood; and but for those per-
sons who were lately so indifferent to her,
Armida would have believed herself
among total strangers. Her mother, to

whom she had at first flown with all the
energy of her disposition, received her
indeed with the most fascinating sweet-
ness; but it was that kind of sweetness
which we practise towards an enemy we
want to circumvent or disarm, rather than
a child whom we love. Her brother, the
most pensive and dejected boy that ever
lived, she did not feel herself much at-
tracted by, and if she had, he was so
watched by his mother and Morosini,
that the least intercourse between them
was utterly impossible. Chilled and dis-
appointed, Armida resigned herself al-
most to solitude; and one evening as she
sat in her lonely apartment, Lady Mont-
clare entered eagerly~" My dear Ar-
mida, I have charming intelligence for
you: Colonel Wandesford is in Ireland,
he will be here to-night.”
Before she could answer, the tumult
in the castle announced the arrival of
Wandesford. With all her pride and
insensibility, Armida trembled, and the

tone in which she inquired if it were
necessary that she should see him that
night betrayed all the depression of
her heart. But Lady Montclare, was
resolved not to permit her to retreat, and
in a few moments Armida found herself
in the presence of Wandesford. He im-
mediately flew to her with the most rap-
turous vehemence, and before she could
even reach the seat which her faltering
steps were seeking, persecuted her for a
verbal and immediate confirmation of his
hopes with such importunity, that Ar-
mida, shocked, harassed, and abashed,
again repeated her promise, and appealed
to Lady Montclare for its confirmation.
She then pleaded her recent calamity as
an excuse for retirement, and returned to
her apartment.
The following evening Armida and
Rosine wandered out on the rocks; Wan-
desford soon followed them, and Armida,
though she saw his approach with re-
luctance, tried to conceal it, and pointed

out some of the striking and original
scenery around, perhaps to draw bis at-
tention from herself. Wandesford could
not help allowing its wild, Salvator
beauty, but he spoke the cold, technical
language of a man whose claims to taste
were derived only from his having been

abroad. Armida in vain tried to com-
municate to him some of the enthusiasm,
the dulcia vitia of her mind. Wandes-
ford, after whistling vacantly for a mo-
ment, observed the extraordinary effect
- of the echo among those rocks, and coldly
importuned Armida to sing for him.
"! Ah! it is impossible,” said she, “ to
make an effort that demands sensibility
and imagination, while conscious that
they do not exist within you, or within
those who listen to you: I cannot sing in
this cold climate. I require to be sur-
rounded, as I once was, with groves of
orange, wakened into fragrance by the
breeze, and touched with the magic of
moonlight, every pause filled with the

delight. Oh! then I have felt the in-
spiration of music: then I have resigned
my
whole soul to sounds, which, but for
their effect, I was scarce conscious I ut-
tered : then I have breathed notes that
never will be heard from these lips again.”
“ But I was never more prepared to
admire and to enjoy than at this moment," }
said Wandesford.
“ When we prepare for the reception
of pleasure," said Armida, "pleasure
never arrives. Recollect any moment of
exquisite enjoyment, and you will find it
has had as little resemblance to the mo-
ments that preceded it as the meteor to
the cloud that it brightens for an instant.
A few fugitive notes breathed in a sudden
pause; an impassioned sentiment suggested
by a withering flower, or an evening
cloud ; an unfinished picture with some
brilliant touches that make you think it
will be more than perfect when fivished,
and hide from you that its principal charm

true sources of pleasure: in whatever
pleases man there must be something
in that resembles his nature, something im-
perfect, that awaits a fuller develop-
ment.”
i Yet when she had uttered her feelings,
1 she was so startled by the angry gloom
di of Wandesford's countenance, that she
dispatched Rosine to the castle for her
lyre, an instrụment which was constructed
: by her order from the model of one found
F in Herculaneum, and on which she used
to accompany herself in the open air:
but the cold and solitary praise of Wan-
desford, the mournful echoes of the shore,
and the rude breath of an autumnal blast
scattering her fine notes on the desert
rocks, formed such a contrast to her for-
mer destiny, that, after a few bars, she
paused; her hand faltered on the strings,
and she bowed her head to conceal the
tears that fell on them. Wandesford,

strongly as their mutual silence. At and
length Armida caught up the neglected
lyre, and under that impulse wbich ge jo
nius derives from grief, and which, though is
not the happiest, is the strongest it can
feel, she struck a few chords. The notes at
were at first few and interrupted, but as de
she sung, she mingled with them an ex-
pression that at once conveyed the bril-
liancy of her former destiny, and her
present desolation. There is a tone in
music that has the power of conveying ik
beyond language this contrasted feeling
to the heart, where the dying sweetness
of past recollection softens while it exalts
present sufferings. As she proceeded,
and the consciousness of excellence gave.

choly triumph in them that seemed to
say-"My talents are not lost, though

they are no longer admired.” A sigh,
that did not proceed from Rosine, made
her pause : sbe turned, she looked up-
ward, and the figure that she beheld
bending over her made her silent from
wonder. It was that of a young man
whose strength and stature rose almost to
the gigantic, yet retained so much youth-
ful facility, and harmonious modulation,
that it seemed rather to constitute a new
order of human architecture than to de.
part from ordinary dimensions. He wore
the ancient Irish dress: it consisted of
(1) drawers of a vivid yellots, closely
adapted to the limbs, and terminating in
buskins, whose complicated braids gave to
the feet and ancles the appearance of those
of an ancient statue. The vest (the fillan
of the ancient Irish) was of the same
colour and texture, and clasped at the
throat with a triangular broach. The
mantle of regal purple, flowing back from
one broad shoulder, displayed an arm that
seemed formed to bear the ensigns of war

or empire: the other arm, carelessly
wrapped in the folds of his mantle, held
the ancient Irish barret cap. But of the
countenance, Armida, though she looked
up only for a moment, felt that a single
view was enough to stamp an everlasting
impression : it was one of which the per-
fect and regular beauty was lost in the
expression. Less depth of thought, less
darkness of melancholy, less wild and
romantic sublimity of expression, would
have allowed more pleasure in the con-
templation of features, whose symmetry,
combined with a deep brown complexion,
made them resemble the bust of a classic
hero. His upper lip was darkened by
the hair which the ancient Irish suffered
to grow there, and his hair, closely cut
behind, so as to display the fine contour
of the head and neck, whose very bend
seemed to denote a proud submission,
poured all its dark and wavy voluines to
the front, and parting on the marble fore-
head terminated in the coulin---the long,

ancient Irish, while its clustering ringlets,
shading the temples, and wandering on
the cheek, seemed like foliage mantling
over the polished surface of a pillar-it
was Connal O'Morven. He was bending
1 over her as she sung with close attention,
and as she turned, his face was irradiated
with a sudden blush that proved it ca-
pable of every expression. Armida trem-
bled in every limb at his presence with
à terror she could neither repress or de-
scribe; but pride supplied the place of
self-command, and she continued to sit,
and even to touch her lyre, though her
disobedient fingers could not produce a
distinct sound. There was
a' mutual
pause, till Connal, with a sigh like that
with which we wake from a delicious
dream, was slowly retiring, when, struck
by the silence of Armida and Rosine, he
murmured an apology for his intrusion.

coldly answered there was none.
“Yes,"said Connal, his character invia-
cibly breaking out, "yes, I am an intruder,
for on no spot of these alienated grounds
have I a right to set my foot; yet I have
wandered here every evening to behold
you, and when at a distance I saw your
drapery like a cloud enshrouding some
bright spirit-at a distance I gazed and
worshipped. But those sounds : oh! what
mortal could resist them: I followed them
till I knew not where I was.”
“ Can you then admire Italian music?"
said Armida, with surprise.
" I know not, for I cannot yet believe
the sounds I heard to be mortal,” said
Connal.
*Yet there are times when, even Italian
music sinks under my conceptions of the
power
of music,” said Armida, on whom
the feeling of her altered destiny rushed
sadly.

" I cannot feel its defects,” said Con-.
nal, “ for I have heard it only from your
lips.”
“I have sometimes thought,” said
Armida, it wanted the power of ex-
citing the melancholy, the deep and trou-
bled feeling that is a source of the most
exquisite pleasure. To a few, Italian
music, as I have sometimes heard it sung
by a pale, seductive, languishing Italian,
fainting under a perfumed and glowing
sky, and sigbing forth sounds that seemed
the natural language of the climate, the
very spirit of the warm, voluptuous air,
such music is perhaps the music of the
senses; but I want the music of the heart:
such music gives all the pleasures of
sound, but I want its pains."
“Oh, heaven !” said Condal, touched
by her language, “why have you not
heard the native music of Ireland ? Oh!
there is a wildness, a.passion, a tone of
the heart in it that you have sought, and
but in it you will seek in vain: they

have little of the art, but all the soul of
that exquisite science of which you ap-
pear the visible deity."
Armida listened with incredulous con-
tempt, and she spoke disdainfully of the
sounds she had heard from the peasants
of Ireland.
- It is the fate of the Icish language
and Irish music,” said Connal, “to be
degraded into the language and music of
the vulgar, and when we hear it from
their lips we forget that it has been the
language of the hero, the poble, or the
poet. For eight hundred years the har-,
mony of her language has ceased, for
those who gave it harmony are no more :
her chiefs, her bards, and her minstrels
are gone. Her language, proscribed by
England, and forgotten by herself, is
now only the language of mendicants ;
and in its day of degradation we dare to
pronounce what it has been, when in-
spired by genius, and modulated by
mony."

Armida, astonished at opinions heard
for the first time, was yet more asto-
nished at feeling herself awed by the mild
but resistless firmness of manner with
which they were uttered. Accustomed
only to obsequious concessions or extra-
vagant praises, she felt embarrassed ;
but sbe tried to collect her ideas, to put
the vast forces of her mind in motion, yet
her viodication of Italian music was
feebler than she imagined.
While she spoke she often paused, and
often faltered from a diffidence she had
never felt in the crowded circles she had
been accustomed to speak before; and
when he answered, she felt that tones so
rich, so broken, so pleading, might more
than atone for the offence of resisting her
darling opinions. She tried to listen, that
she might refute ; but her determina-
tion was lost in the thought that she had
never beheld such a countenance as tbat

wonder how the mild and moon-like
lustre of the effulgent eyes that were
raised to her's could at once be so soft
and so oppressive. Of all he said she
only retained the last sentence" all
other music is the production of science :
Irish music is the effusion of passion, and
of the heart : our dirges were composed
by bards, who hung round the body of
their chief: our war-songs, amid the rage
of a battle on which the fate of the min-
steel and of his country hung, often amid
the death-shock into which the minstrel
himself, smote with the madness he in-
spired, bas plunged, and mingled the last
sounds of his harp with his own : our
love songs were composed in the very
presence of the beauty they praised ; and
oh! who," said Connal, “ can imagine
the inspiration of such a presence. This is
a difference which affects the very nature
and spirit of music :: it is not the cold
and laboured imitation of something the

minstrel never felt : it is the rich and
rapt effusion of a burdened spirit, tor-
tured with the fulness of its conceptions,
over-informing the medium through
which it pours them, and by its inspira-
tions forcing it to represent them with a
terrible fidelity that makes the auditors
tremble.”
As he spoke of Irish music bis habi-
tual gloom was gone : his melancholy
seemed for a moment to take a glow from
his passions, like a dark evening cloud
tinged by the setting sun.
Armida no longer contended; but
still jealous of her superiority, she called
on him to justify his praises of Irish
music, and offered him her lyre. Connal
took it with the air of one who was
above the trifling of importunity. His
touch proved him a master of it; and he
sung the Irish air of " The summer is
coming,” with the Irish words. The
sounds he uttered had more affinity to

the murmur of the brook or the breeze
than to any music she had ever heard.
He sung with the passionate melancholy,
the wild, fugitive cadences, the troubled
pausings, the deep, low, and lengthened
cadence of an Irish song: it seemed like
the very groans of music.
Armida walked to a distance to hide
the tear which her pride and her science
alike condemned.
• What is the matter with me " said
she mentally, " am I listening with
anguish and delight to the song of a sa-
vage Irishman, a native of this abhorred
country, where I have been buried? It must
bethedejection of indolence,of my neglect-
ed talents: I am growing wild in solitude :
Oh! that he could see me as I once was!"
That moment it occurred to her that
she had promised to shew Wandesford her
paintings the following evening, and an irre-
sistible wish to dazzle the proud Milesian
with the display of her talents seized her.

She turned to Connal the full lustre of
her looks; those looks the expression of
which had always been equal to a com-
mand, and uttered a wish that he should

them. The proud blood of Armida

The whole of the following day Ar-

paintings, her statues, and her music, she
had only to sit down and sigh amid those
memorials of a brilliant existence which
seemed like that of a dream : obscurity
and oblivion had stolen over the orna-

gifted mind that bad adorned it. She
had not entered it for some time previous
to her father's death, and she now did so
with a feeling she could not account for.

delight, had returned as if by enchant-

an anxiety to please, such as she had
never felt before.
When Rosine entered the apartment in
the evening she was employed io giving a
few touches to a picture, which in sub.
ject and colouring so much resembled
one in the neighbourhood of the castle,
that Rosine remarked it, and added a ro-
mantic wish she had once heard Connal
utter, that some spirit of the air would
hang a thin wreath of clouds on the sum-
mit of a rock that stood erect and bare
in the centre of the view.
Armida, silently pursuing her task,
mantled the peak over with a vapour of
the most orient and fantastic hues.
“Do you think he will come ?" said
she at length.
• Colonel Wandesford ? He has not
quitted the castle all day,” said Ro-
sine.
"I do not mean him," said Armida,
"I mean the brother of Desmond."

* Did he not decline coming to the
castle?” said Rosine.
" True, true," replied Armida ; and
she bowed her burning cheek over the
painting. “Let him stay and solace him-
self at home with the mouldering por-
traits of his Milesian ancestry.”
“Oh! Armida," said Rosine, “ how
can you speak so contemptuously of a
man struggling so nobly with his fallen
fortune, and all its humbling and bitter
inflictions,”
" Tell me not of his virtues," said Ar-
mida : “ tell me of his haughtiness, his
sullendess, his visible contempt of me: I
felt them all,” she added, rising from her
seat.
"How is it possible I should not
hate that man ?"
My dear Armida,” said Rosine,
whose eyes began to be opened, “I neither
wish you to hate or love him ; but are
there not many whom one may approve,
or barely tolerate?”
“ And do you think,” said Armida,

turping the full lustre of her eyes on Ro-
sine, “ do you think that Connal O'Mor-
ven is a character to be barely tolerated ?
I feel he must be either loved or hated.'
« A detached figure always appears
striking,” said Rosine ; “ but should
you meet him in the world -"
“ I tell you I never met any thing like
him in the whole world,” said Armida.
" And can you,” said Rosine, "accus-
tomed to the polish of courts, prefer the
singularities of one 'reared in solitude and
indigence ?"
“Your language is harsh, Rosine,"
said Armida, casting down der eyes.
" I only repeat what I have heard you
say of his whole nation,” said Rosine.
“ But that was before I saw him,"
answered Armida, sinking into a reve-
rie.
Rosine reminded her it was time to
dress, for she had on only the loose robe
she wore in the morning.
No,"

dress.-Did'nt I wear this last night ?".
“ I believe so," said Rosine"; "and at
times I thought I never saw you look
so beautiful."
" Then no matter how I look to-night;"
and she walked to the glass, and gazed
at herself for a moment with a look in
which a proud consciousness of beauty
was mingled for the first time with that
timidity which is inseparable from a soli-
citude to please.
The family now entered the cabinet,
and Armida, flushed, trembling, and dis-
kevelled, advanced to meet them ; but
trembling, flushed, and dishevelled as she
was, never had she looked so lovely. Her
loose black dress, thrown on without
eare, and still retained from a partial
consciousness of the touching and in-
definite shade it gave her figure, was ut-
terly at variance with the quick and
trembling animation of her movements;

Wandesford, her mother, the elder
O'Morven, and the priest, gazed on
the paintings, and while they lavished
praises on them and their artist, who
heard them with indifference, Connal en-

intellectual luxury which the apartment
displayed, he for a moment forgot every
thing but the brilliant enchantress before
him, and the fairy palace she bad raised
and embellished: but he was soon re-
called by the reception he met. The
strangers stared :
Wandesford visibly
frowned ; and his father, who felt an emo-
tion of shame at the sight of his neglect-

* I feel I am,” said Connal, with that
mixture of mild and proud dejection that
marked his character.
Armida was pointing out one of her
everyone
pressed forward to view it. Connal alone
stood apart: he was gazing on the beau-
tiful arm that held back the curtain sus.
pended over it; so white, so undulating,
it seemed like a marble ornament attached
to its folds. The pride of the woman and
the artist contended in the bosom of Ar-
mida.
The subject of the painting was Alex-
ander weeping at the tomb of Achilles.
Wandesford talked profusely of the mild
and mellow brilliancy of the lights that

looked down: she was more desirous of
the praise of sentiment than execution.

guish of ambition at the recollection that

that when a few more suns had set the
tomb of Alexander would be like that of
Achilles, defaced and unknown ?"
· Armida, whose eyes flashed with the
triumph of vindicated genius, turned the
full moon-tide effulgence of her beautiful
countenance on Connal, and taking a rose
from her hair, offered it to him, with a
wish that it was the golden violet with
which the bards of Provence were re-
warded.
“ How difficult,” she added, “it is
sometimes to be understood."
Connal took the rose without speaking,
but he bowed as he received it, not with
the slight reverence of modern courtesy,
but with the deep inclination of an eastern
slave.
When he raised his head, the long
tresses of the coulin had fallen over his
cheek; but its burning hue could be seen
through its curls.

was struck by the sound of music issuing
from a recess before which a curtain
hung. It was withdrawn : within was a
pavilion, built to catch a picturesque
view of the shore. There was no light
in it except what was poured in by the
bright full-moon that shone just opposite
the open casement. The walls were hung
with velvet, covered with exquisite paint-
ings from the antique ; but the forms
and colours were mixed in a kind of sba.

open, and beyond it were seen the full
glory of the moonlight sea, the aërial
rocks, and the blue, breathless sky: but
within there was something still more
lovely.
Armida, who had quitted the room a few
moments before, was extended on a couch

bung over the strings ; her eyes turped to
the casement, as if she was unconscious
there was a spectator near her; but she was
not; her burning cheek, her attitude, her
wild, aërial, yet melancholy beauty, shew-
ed that she had fixed on that moment to
display all the wonders of her art:
Her mourning dress was exchanged for
an azure robe; her arms were bare, and
some wandering ringlets of hair were all
that shaded her bosom: her dark hair,
divided on her forehead, whose whiteness
gleamed like that of a star, was fastened
by a crescent of sapphire. Her dress, in
that visionary light, seemed more like a
cloud, a vapour stealing round and en-
shrouding her, than like mortal vesture :
her form was that of some attendant spi-
rit of the night, who had glided to earth
on a beam of the moon, and was looking
upward for her native sphere; yet, when
one viewed her steadily, there was a flush,
a trembling, a touch of mortality in her

expression that made her still more
lovely; and her faint, ethereal garb was
strongly contrasted by the vivid crimson
of her cheek, and the lustre of her eyes,
almost the only objects visible in that
pale light.
Every one was silent, and Armida
sung.
She had struck a few notes to
call their attention, and she now sung
one of the most soft and simple airs she
could recollect, and, as if her fingers
touched the harp involuntarily, a chord
broke from it from time to time, among
whose deep and numerous murmurs her
voice seemed lost for a moment. Her
voice had not its usual strength: it had
the rich trembling of passion : conscious
of her powers, and feeling that the pre-
sent moment developed them all, she gave
up her whole soul to song, She devoted
herself with the impetuosity, the “ sweet
madness" of her mind to the object of
subduing and enslaving one whose supe-
rior form and mind seemed to bid defia

tractions, she was "too bright for sense,”
and she had placed herself in the magic
of moonlight, for she knew that over
melancholy minds that hour has a power
that commands all their tides of feeling.
When her song ceased, the rest crowded
into the pavilion ; Connal alone remained
behind. Her eye, wandering over every
other figure, sought for bis : she saw
him when alone take from his bosom the
rose which she had given hin and press
it to his lips. . At that moment she per-
ceived it was black : it was one of the
mourning flowers which she had worn the
early part of the evening in her hair: her
spirits, strongly excited, were overpower-
ed by this trivial circumstance: she burst
into tears.
Connal, at the sound of her voice, eu-

tered the pavilion : she did not attempt
to hide her tears, for she knew they en-
creased her beauty.
“ When I am exhausted by music,"
said she, “nothing relieves me so much
as tears,"
“ And you who can feel the soul of
song,” said Connal, “ can you not sing
Irish music ? Oh, sing one Irish song
foc
me.”
She felt her power in those accents, and
she was determined to triumph in it.
“ Not here,” said she; “this place was
made for other sounds : this foliage, these
paintings, reflect the voluptuous light of
an Italian bower: they breathe the lux-
urious languor of Italian moonlight : if I
sing Irish, music, it shall be amid scenes
suited to it, on a crag of yonder rock,
with the waves murmuring at my feet,
and the wind moaning through the strings
of my harp. Can you carry it so far?',
she added, smiling.

Armida, who had been accustomed to
the epithet, did not inquire why it gave
her a sensation stie had never felt before,
She was advancing to a door which open-
ed on a flight of natural steps that led to
the shore, when Lady Kilcarrick stopped
her. This had been a most irksome pight;
she did not understand paintings; she
did not like music; but when she heard
Irish songs spoken of, she thought she
might declare ber approbation of what

" How can you bear those things so
calmly ?" said she to Connal, who she
knew would follow her.
“ We must bear with age and weak-
ness,” said Connal; “ but at such a mo-
ment, the moment of inspiration, to be re-
minded of mortality by such a monitor
it is at such a moment we require it-oh,
how much we require it at a moment
like this."
" Your philosophy is enviable,” said
Armida, haughtily.
“ It is at least necessary,” said Conpal,
" for one like me. Does superior feeling
bestow, any thing but superior' misery?
Self-satisfied as that weak woman is, how
much more so would she be, could she
but look into a heart that is cursed with
feeling. How would she mock its agony !
but she cannot: that is at least the privi-
lege of such a heart; a privilege, that
before it parts with, it will break.”
Armida was at once touched and indige
nant at this proud and melancholy mind.

Her wish to subdue it had become a pas-
sion; she ceased to struggle with it; she
gave herself up to it, till the resolution
appeared to her almost like a virtue. She
seated herself on the rock, on which Con-
nal had spread his maotle. The breeze
lifted her long hair with a gentle motion :
the moon, as the light clouds floated over
it, touched her figure from time to time
with a tremulous and indefinite light:
one bright star was over her head; she
raised her white arm to it silently, and re-
mained in that attitude, for she felt that
Connal was gazing at her. She did not
encounter his eye, but she heard him
breathe only sighs, and she felt his bosom
throbbing through her thin robe as he
lay at her feet. That was the moment
she chose for her song: it was an old
Irish melody, most musical, most melan-
choly.
“ It was such a song, at such an hour,"
said Connal, “ that brought the spirits
of those he loved around the bard of old :

its virtue is not lost; there is not a
thought I have ever loved, that does not
visit my mind this moment, and make it
feel like heaven."
Armida renewed her song, nor did she,
dare to ask herself why she felt more
exquisite pleasure, seated on a rude rock
on the shore of Ireland, and singing for a
wild Milesian, than she had ever felt in
the most brilliant circles in Italy.
Connal waved his arm,

feet, was the seat of my ancestors; the
palace of princes, whose view only bound-

o It reminds me of the strain the spirit
of our rüined family is said to have pour-

die,” said Connal; "a strain so sweet,
that the rapt wretch forgets it comes to
warn him of woe and death."
" And does mine tell no more?" said
Armida, hiding her burning cheek on ber
barp.

starting wildly from her feet, “ it tells
me to fly from you for ever.”

to let Miss Fitzalban remaio so long in
the night air. Lady Montclare, who
saw the sullen anger of Wandesford, im-
mediately followed her daughter; and
with a smile, through the sweetness of
which no one could discover hatred or
suspicion, told her they had fed long
enough or sound, and summoned them to
the castle to partake of more substantial
refreshment.
Aye, dear Lady Montelare," said the
dowager, you are a comfortable, sub-
stantial creature, and I love every thing
comfortable: all this wandering on rocks
by moonlight is very fine to be sure, but I
shall feel the effects of it in every bone in
my body to-morrow.”
As they returned to the castle, Armida
paused to point out to Connal a rock, over
which a stream was dashing in the moon-
light, and she expressed a wish to visit it
the following evening.
“We will bring an Eolian harp," said

will recall the thoughts of other times.'
“ There is but one harp bas that pow-

Connal had thrown over Armida, exclaim.

“How can you bury yourself in those

Armida, trembling at the insult, at-
tempted to raise the mantle, and as Con-
nal prevented her, said
“I will return this, but I will keep the
beautiful ornament that fastens it :-it
looked like a fairy gem in the moon-
light,” and she tried to detach the cres-
cent of gold and amethyst that clasped it
on the shoulder. Connal eagerly assisted
her: their hands touched each other.
She raised her eyes with haughty pleasure
to Wandesford; but the horrid smile

that divided his ashy lips, as he looked at
them, made her start: but her pride was
stronger than fears; and though she
trembled, she said to Connal :--
“ How can I deprive you of this valu-
able gem ?”
“ You have given me one ten thou-
sand times more valuable,” said Connal,
pointing to his bosom, where he had hid
the rose.' As he 'wrapt himself in his
mantle, she gazed on his heroic figure and
romantic dress with a pleasure which she
believed the same a fine picture used to
inspire ; yet sbe felt that since she saw
him pictures had become indifferent to
her.
“ We shall visit you to-morrow,"
''
said she, as they parted. “Iam told that
you sit on a solitary rock, and count the
isles scattered round you, like the guar-
dian spirit of the Hebrides viewing the
tributary saints of his domain.”
“ And to-inorrow,” said Connal, with
unusual gaiety, “I shall count an angel
among them."

In the course of the following day,
Lady Kilcarrick completely succeeded in
making good her quarters at the castle.
Her gossipping officiousness and her
rank were of use to Lady Montclare, who
had every reason to strengthen her party
in a country where she was only known as
å stranger, arriving under mysterious cir-
cumstances; and knew that those who
would not think of examining papers and
parchments would be satisfied by the
report of her being visited by the rigid
Lady Kilcárrick. But Lady Kilcarrick
herself had much deeper plans in this
visit: she wished to see how affairs stood

in this mysterious family; and according
to them to form a connexion for her
grand-daughter, Lady Gabriella, with
the young lord; with Wandesford, whom
she had no slight hope of detaching from
Armida; or even with Connal or Des-
mond, if she could succeed in exciting
either of them to dispute the recent and
dubious title of Endymion to the inherit-
ance of their family. She submitted
therefore to the polite importunities of
Lady Montclare to make the castle her
residence, till the carriage was repaired;
and she even'accompanied the party the
following evening, as they wandered on
the rocks, toʻadjust her plan of operations.
As Armida approached the rock she had
promised to visit, the figure of Conpal,
standing in the rich glow of autumnal
sun-set, and gazing with folded arms on
the castle of his ancestors, appeared on
it's summit.
He seemed at that moment fit to lead
“an høst angelic, clad in burning arms."

Arinida, who saw him first, appeared to
read his mind.
“Nothing but pride inhabits there,"s
said she, mentally: " he has no passions ;
he sees the seat of his family with emò-
tion, but its inhabitants excite none : oh,
that that proud form of his contained a
mind less prood."
She received him coldly; but when she
heard the rich, firm music of his voice
suddenly broken ; when he turned from
the rest to her; and the faltering tone
in which he offered to assist her ascending
the rock, she forgot every thing but his
presence. She had wished to defer this
walk till moonlight, and she said some-
thing faintly about its effect on the sce-
nery.
"Oh,” said Connal, “it is the sweetest
light; I always loved it, but I love it
more than ever."
Armida felt the meaning of these
words, and she drew down her veil to
hide its effects on her conscious cheek.

the air and sun ; but they have - faded
The rocky path suddenly wound round
an angle, and the cavern, with the ocean
rolling beneath, burst on them in all the
light of sun-set. Armida, as she still
held his arm, remembered the time when
such a prospect would have suggested to
her a flow of poetical sentiment and lan-
guage that resembled inspiration. She
wished to impress Connal with the powers
she had formerly possessed ; but after
some ineffectual attempts to recall them,
she said in a broken voice, “ I once had
feelings, that, like Aowers, bloomed in
away.
I believe I may say with Ophelia,
- They all withered when my father
died ;” and she wept, but not for her
father.
“ There are some relics of antiquity
here,” said Connal as they entered the
cavern, " that go even beyond tradition,
Do you see where those stones have been
lately removed? The other night an
old harper came to my grandfather's door,

from which none of his brethren have ever
been excluded at nigbt: he played on his
harp, and sung "spatches of old tunes,"
some of which made my heart burn
within me: among the rest was one which
told of a battle between two rival chiefs
of our house fought on this shore; they
both fell, and were interred in a cave
with all their armorial and princely in-
signia.
My grandfather was roused by the
tale, and he made the old man tell it
again and again, till his aged faculties
kindled with the feeling he awoke, and
he declared, that though the tale bad been
told him when blind, the local description
was so strong, that if he was led to the
cave, he could point out where the corses
lay. We went by torch-light to the
cave : some of the followers (I cannot
call them servants, for their service is
gratuitous) attended us. I held a torch
near the old man; it was an awful sight to
see him, as the light glared on his pale

stretched out to feel for the spot he said
he knew. The light fell on him alone..
all the rest of the cavern was dark; at
last he reached that mound: I toiled half
the night to remove the stones' that co-
vered it."
" And did you remove those stones ?”
said :Wandesford, pointing to the masses
of rock that lay scattered round the ca-
vern : you must be devilish strong."
“ I hoped to please my grandfather by
my efforts,” said Connal; “ and my pow-
ers of body and mind have little other
employment. Beneath those stones I
discovered the skeletons: the dryness of
the soil had preserved and bleached the
bones; they appeared to have belonged
to men of formidable size : there we found
the weapons of the slain; and what de-
lighted my grandfather still more, the
regal ornaments of gold they wore on
the day of battle. He added them to the

to him, and one which he values, more
than all he has lost.”
Armida wandered on : the melancholy
awe of the place had breathed itself into
her mind, but it was the melancholy of
passion, mixed with its own peculiar plea-
Far to the left there was a cavity,
whose depth no eye could measure : un-
consciously she had reached the very
verge of it, and stood there with her
ethereal form and light vesture, resem- «
bling the first bright fallen spirit on the
brink of chaos. Connal, suddenly dart- !
ing forward, and snatching her from it, i
exclaimed, " Why do
you venture to the
edge of that gulph: do you imagine, like
Curtius's, it requires the most precious
thing in the world to be thrown into it?"
Armida trembled between resentment and
pleasure : she tried to extricate herself
from his arms, but though his touch was
as light as that of a spirit, she could
not.

Desmond, who had followed them with
Endymion, when he saw Connal throw
his arms around Armida; struck by a
contrast he dared not even name, rushed
from the cave, and threw himself against
a fragment of rock at its entrance. In a
few moments the voice of Endymion, who
had joined Armida in a few simple notes,
which the echoes of the cave made like
fairy music, reached him. He imagined
he was listening again to the sweet song
of the Italian girl, as it floated on the
sea-blast sweeter than the mermaid's.
He was startled from his dream by Endy-
mion standing beside him: it was twilight,
a few stars twinkled in the blue east; where
the sun had set, a broad mass of san-
guine vapour flushed the water with its
deep dyes, and made it resemble a sea
of blood. Endymion, after gazing on
Desmond, as he leaned on the rock, and
held up his burning cheek to the sea-
breeze, while he felt no breeze could
cool the fever that scorched it, approach.

agitated boy, “it pleased me too much :

“ Oh that sensation," cried Endymion,

a delight that makes me sick and giddy:
the Italians, before an earthquake, have a
sensation for which there is no name ; such
is the sensation I feel in your presence,
that I could throw myself into your
arms and weep, if you
would let me."
Stop, stop,” said Desmond,“ talk
this language no more: if the sight of
each other be thus intoxicating, thus
ruinous, let us part, and see each other
no more."

this. Never did I feel before these

over me, but it is an influence that I

« Oh ! do not, do not talk of going,"
said Endymion, ringing his hands in
agony.
" Am I so lost that I cannot love
or be loved without being guilty : is my
affection a crime, or a curse—why must
I not love you? It is so sad, none can
envy me; none shall ever see me.” He
whispered, “ If you will sometimes let me

hands with wild delight : “ if you shed

sheet of lightning quivered over the sea,

Desmond for a moment believed him
struck dead.

terror, ** did you see that dreadful

“ Yes,” murmured the entranced boy,

A lõud peal of thunder followed, and
the dark clouds, amid which the sun had
set, came rapidly on, spreading them-
selves over the sky, and quenching the
stars that glittered over their heads,
Desmond bore Endymion back to the
cave, that seemed to rock to its recesses,
as the thunder' rolled above, and the
waves, tormented by the storm, dashed

themselves against its rocks, and covered
the wanderers with their spray. They
were alone, but in spite of the terrors of
the elements Desmond found that he
dared not remain alone with Endymion,
and in the first pause of the tempest he
hurried him back to the castle: all there
was confusion and distress ; Armida,
Wandesford, and Connal, had not yet
returned, and Rosine mentioned that she
had left them before the storm commenc-
ed, preparing to visit an island on the
shore, and in an open boat.
“ An open boat!” cried Desmond;
" and in such a night as this !”
And in spite of his father's intreaties,
and the agony of Endymion's silent grasp,
lie rushed to the shore again : few of
the servants followed him.. They reach-
ed the cave with difficulty. The spece
tacle was tremendous. The rocks were
covered with foam, that terribly con-
trasted the blackoess of the raging
waters, amid whose roar they could hard-

other sound on earth.
Some fishermen came hurrying to the
shore, but they declared it madness to
venture out in a storm in which no boat
could live.
• Give me an oar and I will go myself;
I will go alone,” cried Desmond, who
with locked hands, and eyes hollow with
agony, was bending from the rock.
" Must I stand here and see my brother
perish?"
“You must indeed," said one of the
men, “ for there they are; I see them
myself.”
Impossible !" cried Desmond, wild-
ly; " I must have seen them first my-
self."
At that moment the rain seemed to
overcome the fury of the wind, and the
latter blew with short and whistling
gusts, and drove fast the scattering
wrack across the moon, that pale, and,

Armida, Connal, and Wandesford, had
quitted the cavern together.
“ You compared my singing last
night,” said she to Connal, “to that of
the spirit who warns your family of ap-

fancy, or your national superstition ?"

the mournful brightness of a poetical

In Irish mythology every family is sup-,
posed to be attended by a visionary
being, whose office is to predict the ca-
lamity or death of its members. She ap-
pears as an old woman sitting on the
grave, or wandering near the house of
the devoted family, and pouring out a
stream of melancholy sound, half musi-
cal, half moaning, to summons
the
wanderer home. Her song is peculiar
to Irish modulation, that can combine
melody with the wildest tones of grief
and passion. Such is the tale of the
Benshi; it is, like her own music, plea-
sant and mournful to the soul. Men love
to have the discovery of the other world
softened to their minds, and never was
the curtain of futurity drawn by so
gentle a hand. - Amid those ruins,” he
continued, pointing to an isle to which

" And why is she said to inhabit
there?” said Armida.
" It is the burial-place of our family;
and it only waits for a feeble old man,
and two unknown young ones, to close on
the last of the race, from whose graves
no one will pluck a weed to discover the
name they bore.
He paused, and added in a firmer
voice :
- On that isle the ruins of an abbey are
still standing, surrounded by relics of
high antiquity, pillars, crosses, and
cromlechs, the memorials of an age in
which the cross was yet unknown. Be-
neath the walls of its roofless chapel is
the burial-place of our family, marked
with the only traces of sculpture those
ruins preserve. (2) The representations

He checked himself. Wandesford, in
the absurd hope of detecting a boast in
an account so simple, proposed visiting
the island. They advanced to the shore:
several boats were on the beach. The
isle, with its pale ruins, glowed mildly
beneath the moonbeam like fairy land.
" Let us visit them,” said Armida,
" by the setting.sun. I love to see ruins
on the sea-shore, rich with their dark
green dyes, and mantled over with weedy
clusters by that light.”

They had reached the beach as he
spoke, and Connal, well acquainted with
the language of the clouds, suddenly
leaped from the boat which he had towed
round, and drew Armida away.
* There will be a storm," said he.
“And what if there is ?" said Wandes-

advantage : “we shall be at that rock

it begins."

who shrunk from the elements. Connal,

steered. Their passage was calm and
rapid. Armida was silent as she listened
to the measured dashing of the oars.
The stillness, the solitude, the soft light,
and smooth motion, gave her a new sen-
sation-a sensation encreased by the con-
trast between the towering majesty of
Connal, and the humble employment he
was engaged in for her. She watched
his dark eye as it was raised to the clouds
every moment, and the faint sultry blast
blew his dishevelled hair over them, like
clouds obscuring stars in a wintry storm.
He humned a song as he rowed, of which
the sound, though inarticulate, was so
mournful, that Armida started from the
feeling it inspired, and hastened to a sub-
ject of conversation like those upon
which she could once speak with elo-
quence. She spoke of the rosary of
Biscayners, of the vesper-hymn of the
Italian mariners, and of the chromatic
chorus of the Chinese boatsmen. Then

she mentioned the proceleusma of the
ancients, and the high antiquity of naval
music, of which she traced the origin to
an imitation of the sounds that haunt
the sea-shore : and she remarked the
difference between the classical super-
stitions that strewed the surface of the
deep with the most beautiful forms, and
even supposed a sensibility of sound to
exist in its inanimate inhabitants ; (3)

sgeald, who pictured through the clouds

world.
She again reverted to the moonlight
music she had heard trembling on the
shores of Naples, and a tear trembled in
her eye, that was awoke less by past than
present recollections. Connal said he

Irish music, composed under that strong
impulse to which poetry and music both
owe their existence : it is the cry of a
wounded spirit that seeks io music the
echo of its own sadness. During the
many vicissitudes that our family under-

He asked a passenger to whom those
ruins had belonged, and was told that
those walls were all that remained of a
family seat of the O'Morvens, who had
been driven from it when dismantled in
the civil wars. It was one of our castles,
for no part of Ireland was without them
then: it was the roof under which he
had lived, and under which he had hoped
to die. But even this hope had failed
him, and he felt his age more helpless,
and his blindness darker than when he
sat down among the ruins : the ruling
passion was strong, even in death. Be-
fore he expired on the spot, he poured
out his grief to his harp in a strain ad-
dressed to the solitary tenant of the ruins

to imitate. The words are beautiful,

As he spoke, they reached the island:
they landed on the grey, furrowed strand;
and following a path broken by frag-
ments of stone, which gleamed in the
moonlight, and clusters of weeds and
moss, that gave a gay barrenness to the
scene which encreased its sadness, they
entered the ruins of the abbey. The
walls still retained the form of the cross.
One tall tower stood yet in the centre of
the ruins: the interior of the building
was a mass of ruios. The light, piercing
through windows, as richly wrought by
most fantastic foliage as they had once
been with the tracery that connected their
slender stone arches, shewed confused
heaps of crosses, and tombs, and mounds,
over which the long grass waved like the
bending form of the mourner that had
once wandered and wept there. As Con-
nal entered the ruins, he walked with a

on the huge grey walls that looked like a
range of unhewn rock, saw the shadow
of his tall figure bend as he crossed him-
self, and murmured a prayer for the souls
of his ancestors. Wandesford was si-

his common-place of observations was
exbausted. Armida repeated the first
lines of Volney's well-known address,

Armida's heart swelled with passion
at this contempt of life, that seemed to
imply a contempt of her ; but she called
her pride to her, and tried to read by the
moonlight an inscription in English on
one of the tombs that besought her to

the foremost clouds of the storm that

Will you not take up the tale of no-

sarcastically, “and tell us what royal
dust we are treading on?”
“No, sir,” said Connal, haughtily;
" silence is all that dust demands from
me: silence suits the memory of those
whose lot is ambition without fame : let
the last of their race bestow on them all

Armida observed that there were per-,
haps countries, like the stars mentioned
by Newton, whose light had not yet
reached the world ; and when he bowed
silently in answer, she still urged him
to speak of himself: she asked him
whether he often visited that spot.
Yes,” said Connal, “ I visit it often :
often when the sight of the castle has
awoke the bitter thought of my alienated
home and rights, I come here to recon-
cile myself to what I have lost by the
view of what none will contend with me
for; and when I think that the proudest of
those who hung their shields in that hall,
or blew their horns on those grassy hills,
are now a clod of the valley, I blush at
the struggles of my proud spirit, and
look calmly on the only home my
fathers have left me: it is dark and cold,
but as warm and bright as any the world
has to offer one like me.”
Armida hid her silent tears with her
veil, and she said to berself:-

“Oh! that he were less above nature,
or that I was more so.”
Connal was pointing out to Wandes-
ford the figures carved on the most
ancient monuments: Wandesford viewed
them with a contempt he delighted to
express, and he eagerly compared those
rude relics with the splendid monu-
ments of Grecian art at a still earlier
period.
“ The greatest works of antiquity,”.
said Connal, sternly, “were the produc-
tions of despotism or of superstition. At

: Wandesford, reverting to the ancients,
praised them with enthusiasm, and Ar-
mida joined him, for she admired the
ancients from taste and habit, and she
wished to rouse the proud national Mile-
sian to opposition.
" I allow them,” said Connal, “ to
have been perfect in the art of represent-
ing the human form, but they knew little
of the human heart: all that brings our
mind in contact with the minds of those
who lived two thousand years ago; all
that makes us feel the electric thrill of

motest ends of its cord; all this we
seek in vain in the writings of the

refuge of my soul hereafter, almost its
only refuge here.”
Armida's proud heart swelled at this
preference, even of heaven, and she
tried to recall her former powers, and
convince him she was as much detached
from earth as himself. She was leaning
on a tomb-stone, and as the pale light
touched her form with visionary beauty,
she spoke of the scenery around, and of
the feelings it inspired : she spoke of
the dead, but her thoughts were on the

“ On such a night as this,” said she,

that sits on their graves; this dim light,
these ruins, this stillness utter a voice to

more; we remember the dead no longer
as the inmates of a state which man dare
not behold: we remember them as those

soul touched by Connal's devotion, “ to

resign the glow of religion I feel at such
an hour for worlds: such feelings might

from Connal. in proud grief, and fixed
them on heaven, as if appealing from his
coldness and desertion. That moment,
above all others of existence, tried the
soul of Connal: all the armies of the
earth could not have withheld him from
throwing himself at her feet; but the
thought of his destiny came on his heart,
and he stood silent, motionless, and in
agony. Armida, even in that diin light,
perceived the conflict, and pursued her
triumph.

Religion with me must be the re-
ligion of feeling, the impulses of an hour
like this, caught from commercing
with the skies,' the ocean, the moonlight,
and the dead, since the living have no
feeling."
Connal struggled to answer her that
he might recall himself.
“ Oh! your's is the language of a mind
too much at ease. I have known beings
whose exhausted strength could not bear
them to the doors of their hovels; beings
upon whose black and wasted lips if the
wind of heaven was to breathe it would
destroy them; beings upon whose sight-
less eyes the sun and moon rose and set in
vain: and shall those who cannot gaze
on nature be denied the consolations of
religion? Religion is for the wounded in
spirit, whom the world cannot heal; leave
it to them and me.'
Awed, humbled, offended, and enchant-
ed, Armida was silent: there was a mild
feeling force in all he said that made her,

Her genius seemed to shrink under the
masculine energy, sad and stern, that his
character displayed ; yet still her pride
bated his superiority, and she readily
assented to Wandesford's proposal to
quit the ruins before the storm approach-
ed: just as they put off from the shore,
it came on with a violence that rendered
their situation in a moment full of
danger.
To get back was impossible: the wind
blew right from the island : Arinida was
startled from her mingled thoughts of

she spoke of the superior rage and terror
of the storms on the continent, which she
had often witnessed, and she mentioned one
at Rome, where the terrible colours that

flected on the faces of the spectators, some
of which, tinged with green and yellow,
and sulphurous red, and distorted by
expressions of fear and horror, seemed
almost diabolical.
Connal saw their danger : he wrapped
his mantle round Armida, and rowed
with all his strength. Wandesford was
loud in complaints, and curses of his own
folly in accompanying them.
“ You should not have let us go," said
he to Connal.
Let us now think only of returning,"
said Connal, calmly.
The storm now grew terrible: the oars
were useless: the wind drove than rapidly
towards the shore, but it was a part of
it where their boat must be dashed to
pieces, even if it could live through the
breakers, whose yellow high-wrought
foam they could now see distinctly by the
dashes of lightning. Their danger was
now evident: the heaving of the boat

made it impossible for Armida to sit
without support, and the waves, dashing
over her every moment, drenched her
through the thick mantle Connal had
wrapt round her; yet she neither murmur-
ed or trembled: she wondered at her
own super-human courage, and knew not
that the inspiration came from his pre-
sence: she felt all her danger, but she
felt more strongly the pleasure of cling-
ing to him for preservation; and when
by the pale and stormy light she saw
the agony of his countenance when he
looked at her, and felt his frame con-
vulsed with emotion when a waye reached
her, she wished for life. Wandesford
vehemently insisted on their getting to
shore : Connal in the pauses of the storm
explained to him the danger of the
direction they were impelled in, and at
the same time exerted himself to the
utmost to row round a point of rock
where å sloping shore made their landing

to save them. Connal cast a look at
Armida, and that impulse scemed to
awaken all his powers of mind and body.
Exhausted as he was, he again collected
the whole strength of his adamantine
frame. There was something of super-
natural force in his look and motions, as
at one moment he raised his dark flashing
eyes to heaven with a look between
appeal and defiance, and the next bowed
himself to his toil, his long hair stream-
ing on the blast, like a sigoal of distress,
and dashed the waves with the arm of a
giant. As the moon gleamed through
the driving clouds, Armida beheld him
exert that dreadful strength which seems
the last effort of nature. The muscles of
his arms and neck were swelled to the
size of cords: his dark hair, that he im-
patiently shook back, was matted with
the thick drops of toil: bis teeth fastened
in his quivering under-lip, his distended
nostrils, his eye-brows drawn to a poiot,

his short respiration, the convulsed,
elastic spring of his motions terrified her,
though she knew her life depended upon
them; and when the fuller light fell on
his face, she saw the dark, sanguine,
hue with which despair and fatigue
overspread it, and his bloodshot and
bursting eyes that seemed starting from
their sockets.
"Oh ! you' will kill yourself, ” she
shrieked, wild with pity and terror: "and
you cannot save us : let us perish, since
we must perish, without this terrible
struggle."
" Are you mad?” cried Wandesford,
with brutal oaths: “I tell you you are
lost if you drop the oar a moment. Row

Connal had pot remitted his hopeless
toil for a moment, but he now bent his
breast to it with an agony of strength.
For a short time the elements appeared
to have some mercy on them, and during

this interval, his exertions, almost super-
natural as they were, seemed to flatter
them with safety; but in a moment the
gusts came down with doubling fury.
Armida clasped her hands and gazed in
horror on the waves, that, tossing in a
thousand forms, seemed to rush on them
like a host of devouring monsters. Con-
nal called to her to cling to him with all
her strength; she clung to him: the
waves were scattered by the veering blast,
and they heard them broken and howling
at a distance like beasts of
prey:
there
was a pause : they looked round aghast :
the retreating wave advanced again like
a sea in storm in itself. Wandesford,
shouting with fear, started up and at-
tempted to jump out of the boat. Ar-
mida, who had lost all courage, involun-
tarily stretched out her arms to him, and
adjured him to save her, and Connal in
vain exclaimed that if he stirred he
would overset' the boat. Wandesford,

alive only to bis own safety, brutally
dashed her off, and in the convulsions
of bis fear overset the boat: they were
plunged into the water.
“ Then we must perish,” cried Ar-
mida, faintly laying hold on Connal. He
had already folded one arm round her,
while with the other he desperately pre-
pared to swim to sbore.
- Not thus: oh! it were too, blessed
for me such a death."
She heard him murmur, but she knew
not what he said : terror had deprived
her of her senses. For a few moments
Connal struggled with the waves with
more than the might of man, but in
vain: the fury of the waves defied a
single arın : the other was wrapt round
her: the agony of feeling impaired his
strength: he could have saved any one
but her.
At that moment Desmond's boat came
up; Armida was placed in it, still insen-
sible, but Connal, though he clung to

the side, still refused to enter it, till he
had saved Wandesford, who was drifted
near them, hanging in delirium on the
wreck of the boat that was floating with
her keel upwards. Their struggle to
reach the shore was short, dreadful, and
fortunate: Connal was the last to land.
Desmond, grasping his brother's hand,
burst into an agony of tears, and hung
on him for some moments with a boyish
passion, which alarmed while it melted
Connal : he only allowed himself to
press the hand that had saved him from
death, for Armida still lay lifeless in his
arms.
A short debate was held, and Desmond
intreated Connal to resign his burtben to
him, exhausted as he must be with toi!
and wet.
“ I am indeed exhausted,” said Con-
nal, “and therefore let me hold this
cordial to my heart, so sweet, so rich :
oh! leave her in my arms.”
Wandesford was committed to the

servants, and Desmond flew to the castle
to pacify Lady Montclare. The castle
was near, yet Connal often paused with
his burthen, though not from weariness.
She now respired, and spoke at intervals,
but her reason had not yet returned : he
gazed on her pale, still corse-like beauty
in passion and despair.
“ Once only !" 'he murmured; “ will
this be allowed me but once in life-
and ob! how sweetly would such a life as
mine be exchanged for such another
moment."
Her wet hair had fallen back from
her cheek : he touched it with his lips :
she sighed: his hyacinth breath, warm
with life and passion, passing over
her cheek was balmy to her returning
senses : she seemed to see him in a dream.
Her arm that hung on his shoulder
now half-extended itself, and sunk
again; the soft fingers, with a tremu-
lous motion, touched his neck: he felt
every nerve in his body shiver : the

anguish of passion increased with its
hopeless fondness: he held her to bis
breast in sweet and bitter ecstasy; he
felt her too precious to be possessed,
or to be resigned; he felt that he could,
clasp her to his heart with desperate love,
and then spring with her from the rock
he was climbing
The servants of the castle were now
approaching in every direction. He an-
swered them calmly, but he would not
resign her to any: he bore her into the
hall of the castle, where the family were
assembled, who all flew to her with an
eagerness that made them forget her
deliverer. Connal watched them silently
while they applied the usual means for
recovery. As she opened her eyes, a
smile of joy the most brilliant and ex.
quisite flashed over his face, but he turned
abruptly away to where his father, Lady
Montclare, and Endymion, were hanging
round the idol Desmond with blessings
and praises. Connal looked at them for

one heard, and proud in silent anguish
turned away, and cold and solitary, re-
tired to his cold solitașy dwelling without
a word.

Armida did not quit her room till late
the following day, nor did Wandesford ;
but neither were confined by indisposi-
tion. He passed the time in sullen rage
and stifled execration : she in a " long,
long thought of Connal," in that vision-
ary state, when the mind, worn out by vio-
lent emotions, reposes on a beloved image
that seems to appear by moonlight, faint,
distant, delicious.
She 'met Wandesford in the evening
with perfect calmness, for a mind possess-
ed with real passion sees every other ob-
ject with indolent complacency.
As the evening advanced she wished to
see him agaip, to see him before the glow of

last night's struggle had departed and left
him dark and cold: she wished again to
see him as he was last night; his pride,
his coldness, his stern and troubled ma-
jesty, all swept away and forgotten in the
moment when he clasped her in his arms,
and struggled for her with the elements,
and would have died to save her. She
grew restless and absent, and at last,
starting up, she proposed to Rosine to
walk on the rocks.
"To walk!”repeated Lady Kilcarrick;
“ why sure you must be mad to think or
talk of walking so soon after your adveo-
ture, and to the very same spot too: I
protest I think there is something quite
indelicate in going out so soon."
Lady Montclare, fixing her expres-
sive eyes on her daughter, merely ob-
served that the place might revive sensa-
tions too painful and too dangerous.
Armida felt all her mother's meaning,
and, turning away with an air of haughty
levity, said the terrors of last night were

like the wound in the Grecian fable, that
could only be healed by the weapon that
inflicted it, and nothing but the sight of
those rocks could give her tranquillity
again, and she hurried Rosine away.
Wandesford followed them: he had
put the most favourable construction on
her silence: he imagined that in her own
terror she had forgot his; and he be-
lieved her acceptance of his addresses too
public to admit of her retreating in con-
sequence of an obscure adventure.
Their walk was a silent one : Wandes-
ford was sullen, Rosine thoughtful; and
Armida’s ejes wandered over the pros-
pect, as if she had not come out to gaze
on rocks. Her silence and absence, low-
ever, increased every moment, and she was
at last turning reluctantly to the castle,
when Connal suddenly appeared at the
door of a solitary cottage, which was
perched like a cottage among the cliffs
above.
Armida at his sight started with an

emotion too visible to Wandesford, He
looked at her, and his expression for a
moment was so direful that Rosine
eagerly proposed returning : Armida,
with all the pride of her character, re-
fused.
Their meeting was cold and embar-
rassed : she had expected to see him de-
lighted at her thus coming to seek him,
and she found him distant, confused, and
absent. His confusion too visibly in-
creased when Wandesford, observed that
that cottage appeared his favourite haunt.
“ I visit it frequently,” said Connal,
hesitating.
" Some uncommon,
secret
attraction appears to reside there."
“ The prospect from it is beautiful,”
said Connal, his colour deepening.
Armida instantly turned her steps to-
wards the cottage. Coonal said some-
thing dissuasive; but she pressed on with-
out heeding him, and the rest followed.
“ I told you,” said Wandesford, when

they reached it, " it must be some secret
attraction that draws Mr. O'Morven fo
here, for the view is the most barren
these barren rocks afford.”
tha
Armida did not hear him: she was

listening to the mournful accents of a
female voice within the cottage. They fu
all heard it, but none of them spoke.
The cottage door was open : twice Ar th
mida looked in, and twice she proudly the
drew back ; but her passion was now too
powerful for her pride. As they de of
scended she looked back, and saw a beau-
ра
tiful girl, who was wringing her hands
over an infant that lay in her lap. It was
smiling at her, and there was a bitter
contrast between the happy inanity of the
child and the conscious agony of the mo-
ther.
Armida felt her breath suspended -
she fixed her eyes on Connal with an b
expression which, had he known any
thing of the language of woman's eyes,
would have told him more than language

could tell. His were directed to the un-
fortunate woman, whom he viewed with
such obvious, unmingled compassion,
that Armida in a moment felt it was im-
possible he could thus pity what he
I loved. She was now turning her beauti-
ful eyes on him with a different expres-
Ession, when a burst of military music,
that startled the echoes of the desert

Wandesford exclaimed it was the band
of his regiment; and a moment after a

been ordered to quarters on the coast.

dence at the castle, where, he informed
them, Lady Montclare would be happy
to welcome the friends of her future son-
in-law.
Armida, compelled by this reference to
her, and by the officers evidently waiting
for her to confirm the invitation, uttered
a few polite words; but, few as they
were, she hesitated, and wished to recall
them when she thought of the sanction
they gave to Wandesford's pretentions.
The officers, who had heard of Armida
both in Italy and England, and whose
curiosity had been still more excited by
the report of her marriage, when they at
length saw her so beautiful, so lightly
attired, wandering along the rocks of a
wild shore, almost took it for a fairy
vision.
She had uttered but a few words, but
those few had conveyed to them all the
charms of her voice and splendid ad-
dress. They whispered their admiration

loudly to each other, and their congratu-
lations still more loudly to Wandes-
ford.
Armida heard them, and heard them
with a pleasure she could not resist ; flat-
tery sbe had so long been accustomed to,
that it sounded in her ear almost like na-
tive music.
Inspired by pride and love, she now
displayed her long forgotten eloquence of
language and attitude, pointed out the
most striking views to the strangers, and
accompanied her remarks with all the
undulation of her beautiful form, for
which admiration afforded opportunity,
till in the mixed murmur of praise and de-
light she missed the only voice for which
she listened the voice of Coonal. She
forgot what she was saying; and the co-
lour of her beautiful face varied with
fear and resentment.
Wandesford urged her to proceed : her
pride came to her relief, and she conti-
nued to speak with fluency, but without

spirit, and she turned to another subject
to recover herself.
A stream of fresh water fell from the
rock she was leaning on into a natural
basin, at the bottom of which the colours
of the plants and shells glowed beautifully
through the deep clear water. She could
no longer speak with feeling ; but she
spoke with art, and she passed from a
description of the small shell found on
the northern coast of Ireland, which
yields so beautiful a purple, to the ex-
traordinary aquatic weed that floats on
the surface of the Rhine, whose spiral
elasticity of stalk adapts itself with a sen-
sibility like life to the various levels of
the water when swollen by rains or other
causes, so as always to preserve itself on
the surface of the water : but still anx-
ious to interest Connal, she pointed to
the weeds that clustered at the bottom of
the basin, and said she almost envied the
water spirit such a crowa.

" You deserve to be crowned with
them yourself as the genius of the place,"
said Wandes ford.
No,” said Armida with forced
gaiety: “if I were the sovereign of these
isles I would bind my brows with nothing
but a wreath of those yellow flowers that
are waving on the top of that rock, as if
they defied all human reach ;” and she
pointed to a cluster of flowers that were
but just visible from the brightness of
their colour on the summit of a rock
the most high and perilous in their
view.
Wandesford laughed at the idea, and
said if she was the sovereign of the isles
it would be a good punishment for a
rebel subject to compel him to bring her
a wreath from that spot.
He had hardly spoken, when Condal,
springing forward, began to ascend the
rock with frightful activity.
Shocked
and terrified at the consequences of her
fantastic pride, Armida now called, she

shrieked to him to forbear. He was al-
ready almost out of hearing.
The officers eagerly began inquiring
who he was : his silent majesty had
awed them while he stood towering
among them, and they now revenged
themselves by laughing at 'his desperate
folly. But Armida, who felt this wild
action speak, who imagined she heard him
say-"Would the ephemeral beings you
trifle with hazard life at your slightest
wish like Connal?” following him with
straining eyes from point to point of his
terrible progress.
Sometimes she saw
him alight on a crag that seemed hardly
able to bear the weight of a bird : some-
times be sprung upwards by grasping at
a tuft of weeds, which, loosening with
his touch, fell the moment he released it.
At last he reached a ledge of rock, above
which the flowers grew in all their
beauty, as if smiling at the danger that
surrounded them. They were within
a few feet of him: he stretched out his

band, suspending his whole weight on
the opposite limb. The loose stones
shook under his feet : they could hear
them distinctly in the silence below. In-
tent on his prize, he reached forward,
and at that moment the stones on which
he stood gave way he fell. Armida's
sight forsook her, till roused by a shout
of wonder, she looked upwards involunta-
rily, and saw him grasp with miraculous
dexterity a point of rock but a few feet
below that he had fallen from. Every
one now called to him to descend, and each
pointed out a different way as the safest.
- Call to him,” said Rosine, " oh! call
to him to be careful of himself.”
“ Do you call to him," said Armida,
gasping, “ I have no voice.”
But Connal, the moment he recovered
his balance, began the pursuit again ; and
after hanging for a few moments between
life and death, as if by a single hair,
seized the flowers, descended, and, bound-
ing like an eagle from the rock, offered
them to Armida:


## p. 220 (#232) ############################################

Pride, and reproach, and love, flashed
from his eyes, and his bronzed cheek,
and bold, romantic figure, burning with
toil and emotion, looked like a mountain,
on whose dark side the setting son had
fung a rich and umbered light, As he
silently gave her the flowers, the haughty,
eloquent Armida was mute and abashed :
she shrunk from his look ; but when she
saw him turn away without uttering a
word, her fear of his disdaio renewed her
spirits, and exclaiming that the posses-
sion of what was obtained by his danger
could give her nothing but pain; but
that no one else should boast that dan-
ger was incurred for them, she fung
the flowers into the sea, and taking Ro-
sine's arm, tried to walk firmly away.
As they returned to the castle, their eyes
were caught by something white floating
on a rock near them ; it was the dress of
the young woman they had seen in the
cabin: she was sitting on the edge of a
rock that projected into the sea : her face
was turned toward them, but she did not

appear to see them.
One hand clasped
her infant to her breast, the other was ex-
tended to catch a white cloak that was
flying off her shoulder : she caught at
it often, but with such a vacant, helpless
band that still it escaped from her. They
passed : the woman did not observe
them. There was an overwept wildness
in her look, and a desolate absence in
her whole figure, that seemed to have
nothing more to do with mankind.
Armida lingered. Rosine inquired
why they did not go home.
"I cannot go home yet," said Armida:
" latterly I feel myself oppressed but in
the
open
air: the cold wind that used to
chill me, I love it now, and twilight, and
these shores!
"* "Tis a great change,” said Rosine.
Touched by these few words, Armida
moved hastily forwards, till the figure of
Connal, leaning against the opposite
angle of the rock, obstructed her way.
He bowed, but did not attempt to fol-
low them. Compelled to speak to him as

did you leave us ?”
“ To escape from the sight of those
men,” said Connal, impatiently tearing
the weeds from the rock, and trampling
them under his feet.
Armida looked amazed.
• The soldiers ! the soldiers !” he cried
with a sternness that frightened her: “can

and, whenever I hear the sound of war or
fame, almost wishing those ruins would
the fall on me and crush me."
Fluctuating between pride and passion,
subdued by his melancholy, but wounded
even to agony by his indifference, Ar-
mida, folding her veil around her, at-
ed tempted to rush away, when the young
woman, who had been sitting despairingly
on the rock till this moment, with a cry
that bad the agony of death in it, plunged
into the water with her infant in her arms.
Connal heard the plunge: he did not
wait to recognize the object, but, tearing
off bis mantle, threw himself from the
rock in a moment.
Rosine, who had presence of mind
enough to wish to spare Armida the ter-
ror of the sight, endeavoured to interpose
31
between her and the precipice: but Ar.
mida, breaking from her, hung over the
very extreme point of the rock with a
look whose wild passion terrified her. In
spite of the remonstrances of Rosine,
who thought they must all perish, she

continued to gaze, till, she beheld him,
after bringing the mother in safety to the
b
shore, again plunge in after the child,
who had fallen from her convulsed arms,
TE
and at length swim to shore with one
hand, while with the other he held the
infant above the water,
At this moment some of the officers
came up, too late to do any thing but
praise the fearless humanity he had
evinced.
Wandesford forced himself to join i
them, whilst he watched the countenance
F
of Armida. She was gazing on Connal,
as he wrapped the chilled limbs of the
babe in his mantle, and warmed them in
his bosom. In the objects he had saved
she beheld his mistress and his child; and
stunned and tortured by the praises of his
courage and feeling she heard on every
side, all self-command forsook her; her
high, spirit failed, and, tottering forwards
with an attempt to quit the spot, she
fainted in Rosine's arms.
The party immediately gathered

Shis, round her. Wandesford silently exulted;
to the but he had calculated weakly on the hope
child, of Connal shunning her presence, for
urms, the moment he saw her faint he rushed
a cze to her, and resigning all care of the suf-
Cd the ferers he had saved, supported her in his
arms.
She recovered. Before she could see
s but him she felt him bending over her: she
struggled for breath: passion, which had
deprived her of spirits, now renewed
o jill them: she repelled him, and leaned on
Rosine, gasping.
Connal retired without giving her ano-
dether look. She redoubled her efforts to
at speak with ease and vivacity; but she
was now worn out by the struggless of
the evening
At some distance from the castle she was
compelled to pause, and beg of Wandes-
ford to get her some water from a ca-
bin they were passing. While she leant
on Rosine, unable to support herself, she
observed the cabin was the same where
she had seen the stranger at the com-

mencement of her walk. She darted
io
an eager glance : she could dis-
tinctly sce the woman stretched on a
wretched bed, and attended by others,
and Connal seated on the ground with
the child still in his arms. He did not
see her, but she saw him in all his
beauty, for he had thrown back his long
hair, lest the water that streamed from it
should fall on the baby's face, and his
open vest shewed the glowing whiteness
of his bosom, contrasting the chill and
purpled limbs of the little sufferer whom
he tried to warm in it. She turned away,
and, with an effort nearly equal to that of
him who smiles on the rack, walked to
the castle without a sigh.
The moment they reached her apart-
ment, Armida threw up the window, gasp-
ing for air: it was the same at which she
had first seen Connal the night of her ar-
rival: slie closed it, and retreated to the
farthest extremity of the room. Some
tears stood in her eyes, but she repelled
them with a convulsive effort, and when

she recovered her voice, signified her
wish to be alone.
Rosine had no spirits to join the party
below; and not happy enough to retire to
her lonely apartment, she lingered al-
most unconsciously in the gallery till
she heard them separating. She re-
tired as Desmond entered his apartment,
and she heard the long, deep sigh of En-
dymion as he passed his door.
All was still for some hours: at length
Rosine was startled from a broken sleep
by a noise in her room: she sat up, and
withdrawing her curtain, saw Armida
standing beside her bed.
“I cannot sleep, Rosine," said she,
speaking with many pauses. “A strange
thought has visited my mind, and made
me restless.
Who was that woman we
saw to-night?”
Rosine protested her utter ignorance,

“Rosine, let me adjure you to learn

Rosine readily promised, for at that mo.

to her, and he had been famous for rural
gallantry before he had left Ireland ;
yet the next moment, blushing at the
commission, she inquired what interest
Armida could have in the inquiry.
Nothing :-perhaps my pride, per-
haps my curiosity,” said Armida, retiring.
She paused, and returning to the bed
side, and laying ber burning hand on
Rosine's, said with solemnity-
“One request more : never mention to
human being what you have witnessed
this night.”
Rosine promised, and, thanking hea-
ven for her want of wealth, beauty, and
talent, sunk to sleep.

rock where he first beheld Armida.
Desmond threw himself beside him, and
when he saw the deep melancholy that
shaded his brother's face, he almost re-
proached himself for the thoughts with
which he had sought him. He hesitated,
changed his posture, and at length forced
himself to say.
“ You can enjoy solitude, Connal, it

“ No man has more imperfections,"
said Connal, mildly; " but from which of
them do you draw all this consolation ?”
“Oh, my dear Connal,” said Des-
mond, eagerly, “do not attempt to deny
it; I know it all; I have been at the
cabin, and seen the girl and kissed the
baby, the little darling, and felt how
delightful it was to be even an uncle to
such an angel. No one could see its
beautiful black eyes and not know whose
they were. I know it all you see: the
very girl you used to torment me about
two
years ago. How little did I guess
your motive was to keep her to your-

“I know to whom you allude,” said
Connal, his features all glowing with

alternately burned with admiration of his
brother, and with abhorrence of a very
opposite character.

“ And what shall I say on my return
to the castle?" said Desmond, dejectedly.
"Say nothing of me."
Armida had not quitted her apartment
all day, and she pasged her time in tra-
yersing it with burning cheeks and *
rapid step, as if she meant to fly from her
own thoughts. In the evening Rosine
entered her room, and in a few words told
her unsuccessful commission. It was
twilight: she could not observe the
change in Armida’s countenance as she
spoke, and after a long interval of silence
she again repeated that Desmond had
informed her he was well acquainted
with the history of the unfortunate fee
male, but was forbid to disclose a par-
ticular of it within the walls of the
castle. Armida was still silent, and Ro.

All the haughty passions of her soul
flashed in her face as she spoke, and the
step with which she crossed seemed
designed to crush the whole race of
O'Morven into dust. Terrified as Ro-
sine was by her passions, she yet rejoiced
to find that her pride predominated, for
she trembled at the consequences of this
ill-omened attachment. But the feelings
of Armida soon subsided.
" How often,” she exclaimed, “ did I
think him a being above the temptations

have had one, and seen so much of mine

ed he loved me: yes, when the waves
came dashing over us, when I clung to
him, not in hope but in despair, the
looks he threw on me were dark and
bright with grief and love. The light-
ning that shewed me his looks had no
terror; I watched for its flashes to see
him; and when twice he spatched me
from death, was it but bare humanity ?”
Touched by her distress, Rosine faints
ly suggested that bare humanity might
be all that interested him in the fate of
the unhappy female.
“ But would he' not have spoken ?
would be not have told me all
you
have
said in a single look? A single word
would have brought conviction to my
heart. He let me depart without a
look."
Rosine was silent.' Armida felt it in
every fibre of her proud heart.
"I am not what I was,” said she, “I
am not what I was. The first of his
sex never drew a sigh from me before ;

never made my heart beat with hope or
fear. Let him boast of his triumph if
he will, over my grave: my heart may be
broken, but never can be humbled.
Could I seek his love, I were as upworthy
of it as the creature that is preferred to
me."
Rosine, who trembled more and more
as the impassioned character of Armida
developed itself, and the evils of this
ill-fated attachment rose to her _view,
strenuously applauded her sentiments,
and endeavoured, even by topics drawn
from her pride, , to support and confirm
them.
“Oh! do not insult my despair ; do
not reason with me," cried Armida, again
yielding to the wild vicissitudes of pas.

" You first mentioned his name to me;
you first set me on fire with his praises ;
go to him yourself-learn the truth from
himn, adjure him to tell you all; but tell
him not who is waiting in agony for his
confession."

Rosine was silent, but her silence
shewed her steady reluctance to under-
take this shameful commission. Armida,
blinded by passion, still importuned her,
Will you be bribed ?" she exclaimed,
tearing off the diamond clasp of her robe,
and throwing it at Rosine's feet; “ will
you be implored ?" she continued, sink-
ing on her knees before her. ro Oh ! be
not so hard; I am not used to tears or
to intreaty. A few days ago, and who'
would have foretold I would kneel to
you, and for one who is perhaps as in-
sensible as yourself.”
Rosine was now compelled to an ex-
ertion of mind and resolution she had
hitherto been scarce conscious of.
Shocked as she was at the situation of
Armida, and still more at the fatal pros-
pect of her passion, she revolted, with
all the strength of her mind and princi-
ples from the confession of such a pas-
sion from a woman on the point of being
united to another, At suffering she

wept, but at the remotest possibility of
guilt she shuddered ; and with all the
eloquence of virtue she adjured Armida
to remember the solemnity of her engage-
ments to Wandesford, the impossibility
of a successful attachment to Connal, in-
sulated as he was by every circumstance
of nation, birth, and habit ; and though
she trembled at the word, she represent-
ed the still greater horror and iniquity of
her being united to one man and attach-
ed to another; and not even Armida's
pride or superior powers deterred her
from displaying her consciousness of that
attachment with a force that shewed she
was better acquainted with the secrets of
her heart than its possessor. Armida,
though she still remained on her knees,
and overwhelmed with tears, seemed
touched with this appeal to her honour.
“ I am ready to fulfl my engagements,”
she cried, “ I am ready to marry
Wandes-
ford; and then, I swear on my knees,
I swear never to think of him more: only

let me hear him vindicated ; let me know
him not degraded by a vile passion ; let
me think him the being I thought him
yesterday: I ask but that thought to
live
on,
and
you may grant it,” she added
still more wildly,
s for if I must be the
wife of Wandesford, I feel I shall not
live too long."
Heart-sick and appalled, Rosine sunk
into a chair. “Oh! Armida,” she cried,
"I am weary of importunity; I am terrified
by passion; I will interfere or resist
you
no more, but I cannot do what you re-
quire: I will go no further in this busi-
ness.
• You will not !” cried Armida, start-
ing from her knees: her long hair fell
over her face as she rose, she flung it
back, and flashed the full lightnings of
her eyes on Rosine : “ Then you would
not have him justified; you love him your-
self."
« Rosine could have smiled at the sug
gestion, but the maniac figure before her

was no subject for smiles; and she said
with a firmness that commanded the
passions and faculties even of Armida,
es You have at length found a way to
subdue me, Armida; but it is a way
neither honourable to your generosity or
to my affection." She was quitting the
room, when Armida, who appeared at her
last words to awake as if from a dream,
called to her to stay.
Rosine paused : “ Is it possible,” she
exclaimed, “ is it then possible that I
have sunk to this; that twice in one
shameful day I have supplicated, and
supplicated in vain; that I have forgot
my birth, my character, my pride for a
stranger, a savage stranger? Am I Armida
Fitzalban?
• Rosine," she cried, her native cha-
racter returning, « let this night be
erased for ever from your mind, as I wipe
away the traces of these shameful tears,
the first and last that passion shall ever
wring from me.''

As she spoke, with an emotion that
made language impossible, she rushed into
her boudoir, and Rosine did not attempt
to follow her.
During the remainder of the night all
was gay in the castle; and to the officers
Lady Montclare appeared a charming
woman, and Wandesford the happiest of
men. Lady Kilcarrick alone, who still
remained at the castle, was silent and
anxious. She had profited but little by
her observations: the rapid changes of
Armida's mind baffled her penetration,
and the mysterious and mutual avoidance
of Endymion and Desmond, while it ex.
cited her curiosity, defied it. Lady
Montclare, too, in spite of the external
smoothness of her manner, at times be-
trayed an inquietude that suggested
doubts, į which were increased by, her
long private conferences with the monk,
and her evident impatience for the union
of Armida and Wandesford: at length,
finding she could make nothing of thema

as they were, she determined to draw the
enemy out of their entrenchments, and
invited the whole family to an entertain-
ment, which she said she gave in honour
of Lady Montclare's arrival in Ireland.
Wandesford eagerly accepted it, though
he hated Lady Kilcarrick, as it gave him
an opportunity of appearing publicly as
the intended husband of Armida ; and
Lady Kilcarrick set off the next day to
prepare Lady Gabriella for the important
part, and to summon all the country to
her fête. Armida at first determined not
to go, but she was no longer the mistress
of her own actions, and she had no excuse
for resisting the importunities of Wandes-
førd : during the interval, she remained
in her apartment, into which not even
Rosine was invited ; nor for a week did
she quit the walls, or even approach the
casements of the castle that looked to the
shore.
But though her pride could command
her feelings, it could not her health.

She was consuming with a slow fever of
mind and body, and one night that the
officers who, now were constantly at the
castle, were dining with Wandesford, and
Lady Montclare shut up with Morosini,
parched and panting for the cold sea-
breeze, she threw on her veil and walked
on the rocky terrace with Rosine : they
had taken several turns in silence, when
they observed a figure slowly approaching
them; it was almost dark, and till they
passed her, they did not discover the
woman they had seen in the cottage: she
paused as if with a wish to address them,
but Armida moved rapidly on, yet the
next moment turned and encountered her:
the woman now made a visible effort to
detain them, though she did not speak,
and Armida, after a few quick unequal
steps, paused:
“ Does he send her here to insult
said she in a stifled voice: “ this was
needless, and he shall know it," and col-
lecting all her spirits, she turned: "'Oh,

woman sinking to the ground as she
ap-
proached.
“What would you say?" said Armida,
calmly.
Between weakness, fear, and the dig-
nity of Armida's presence, the woman
did not hear, but anxious to detain her,
she again said tremblingly,
" Noble,
beautiful lady, will you listen for one
moment?”
The wretched Armida leaned
Rosine for support.
- Am I noble, am I
beautiful,” she repeated in agony,
I distinguished by nature and fortune,
and yet I am wretched ! I tremble before
a creature upon whom perhaps my whole
sex looks with contempt.'
“ If you have any thing to say to Miss
Fitzalban,” said Rosine, "proceed."
" Will she listen to the speech of such
a creature as I am? I would not dare to
speak of myself, but for one that is be-
yond all the world beside." She stopped,

and Armida, over whose miod a vague
hope began to dawn, desired her to
go on,'
“ I was not always such a creature as
I am now," said the woman, drying her
tears: " I was the child of an honest man,
whom my wickedness killed: he was a
tenant of old O'Morven, at the tower
yonder. I used to see him at chapel,
but I did not go there to mind my reli:
gion, or any thing but Connal O'Morven :
Oh ! from the first day I saw him coming
there with his grandfather leaning on
him, and putting him in his place, and
never lifting his eyes from the altar while
he staid, and bowing to us as he led the
old man out, I thought I could die on
the spot for a look from him: at first I
was so melancholy, I did not think it
could be love for him, till one day as I was
sitting at the cabin door, he rode past on
an unruly horse; and as I looked after
him as far as I could see, he dropped his
whip: oh, I thought I never would be in

time enough to pick it up for him, and
when I did, and gave it to him, he
thanked me in such a voice : oh! the
sound of it will come to my
when I am dying. As he rode away,
some briar-roses that he had in his breast
dropped from it: when he was gone I
caught them up, and though their scent
was gone, I kept them in my hand, and
stood looking after him, though I could
not see him, till I could stand no longer.
From that minute I gave myself up to
a wicked mind : I was a likely girl, and
I thought I might please him as well as
another. I was always throwing myself
in his way, and going to chapel, and
keeping near the old tower, and at last
when he met me, he would blush, but I
neyer could get look or word from him,
for he minded nothing but his grandfather
or his brother, to keep him to his book,
and from running after the girls.

father finding he could get no good of
me, sent me to my uncle that was in a
very good way at Birr, in the King's
County, and I went there ; but I did no
good there neither, for though I was a
modest girl before, yet thinking so much
of one man, made me at last that I could
think of nothing else, and I minded
nothing but going to the square to look at
the officers, for I was determined. Colonel
Wandesford was there with his regiment
then, and oh ! how can I tell my shame-
ful story to such honourable ladies. When
he left it, he took me with him to Eng-
land: he was very fond of me at first, and
he brought me to London among all the
fine people ; and I thought with myself I
ought to be happy, but I never was. The
thought of Connal O'Morven kneeling in
the old ruined chapel was the only thing
I loved to think of: and I would rather
have been sitting on this stone watching
for a sight of him, than in all the fine
places I was brought to : for though

what I was, and the oaths and the wicked
things I heard frightened me, though
I had brought myself to it. I knew it
was wicked to go on as I did, yet I wa's
not good enough to leave off ; and though
I had no pleasure in the clothes and fine
things I had, I thought I would miss
them now I was used to them, but I had
grown só melancholy, that the colonel
began to be tired of me, and when the
regiment was going to Italy, he told me
yawning one day, he would not take me
with him. Oh! then my heart was ready
to break : I was all alone in a strange
country, and I could not go into the
streets, or speak to any, body without
being known for an Irishwoman, só no-
body would like to employ or trust me,
and I had lived so long in idleness, that
half the work I could do before would
kill me now. I begged and prayed him
on my knees to take me for a servant, or
give me to some one else to keep me out

of want and wickedness, but he only
laughed and went out from me. I saw
him no more for some days, and in the
mean time I found myself in a situation
that I was sure he would not quit me, and
the next time we met I told him so, and
intreated him for his child's sake not to
turo its mother into the streets ; but he
fell into such a passion on hearing of it,
that I thought he would murder me. He
cursed and swore, and beat me as long as
I could stand, and longer, for I only re-

ging him not to kill me, 'for I was not

on Connal O'Morven. It was a great
while before I was myself again, and
then I remembered every thing in a mo-
ment, and asked where the colonel was:
they bid me keep myself quiet, and then
I knew there was something worse than
they would tell me, and they sat watching
me all night, and I kept quiet for fear of
them, till at last one went away after
another, and the only one that staid fell
asleep: then I got out of bed as softly as
I could, and began to look about the
room-I hardly knew it again : all the
ornaments and presents the colonel had
given me were gone; the people had taken
them I suppose for their trouble. On
the table there was a letter and a bottle,
both directed to me: I did not know what
it meant till I read the letter, and then
the light left my eyes, and the whole
room looked on fire to me: it was from
Colonel Wandesford, the man that had
ruined me, that left me and his child to
famish. He told me that he sent me a

a bottle of laudanum, and the best thing
I could do was to drink it and end my
cares at once; but if he ever knew me to
follow him again, he would shoot me
with his own hand: my heart was so for-
lorn and broken, that I thought I could
pot do better than take his advice.
“I looked about me; all the house
was quiet : the woman that staid to
watch me was fast asleep, and I thought
before she awoke I would be out of the
way of giving more trouble to her or
to any one else. The thoughts of my
religion came across me once or twice,
but when I thought of that, I thought
too of the chapel where I had first seen
Connal, and since he did not care for me,
why should I live.
“ I took up the laudanum, and just at
that moment the poor baby stirred within
me; I felt it for the first time, and from
that minute, let me be as wretched as I -
could, I determined to live.

them, and, weak as I was, I was far
enough from London before morning.
I need not tell you, my lady, all I had
to do to keep life in the child and myself
for three years that I wandered about
looking for work : every where, because I
was an Irish woman, they thought me a
rogue, and at last I thought I could not
be worse in Ireland ; so I came over, and
when I was once in Ireland, I could not
bear to be any where but where I was
born, and where O'Morven was: I beg-
ged and worked my way here at last,
about a week ago; it was night when I
carne; every thing seemed changed, yet I
remembered every thing well. I did not
dare to go near my father's house, and I
sat down near this on a stone to think
how I had left it an honest girl, and but
for my own wicked heart, how I might
have been a happy one. I could have
sat there for ever and cried my life away,
but my poor child began to cry too: it
was cold and hungry; and I had nothing

to give it; and though I had no heart to
ask for food myself, I thought my father
would not see it starve at his door: I
got up and crawled towards the cabin;
all was dark, I waited for a light or a
step for an hour, at last my child cried
louder, and I knocked; no one answered.
I cannot go on," said the wretched wo.
man, weeping bitterly.
“The next day I
heard my father was dead-dead for my
wickedness and folly; I broke his heart;
I killed
my father.

know how, nor where I lived, nor where
I lay; I wonder I was not killed : I
believe the mark of God was on me,
and that no one cared to hurt the like of
me.

or looked after me; I would have
perished but for Connal O'Morven : the

• He would talk to me for hours, and
his voice was the first thing that brought
me to my senses; when I heard it, the
thoughts of my youth came into my
heart, and tears fell from me for the first

than food or sleep : when I was able he
read to me out of a book, and bid me 'go

angel took away the burning in my head,
and the tightness that I felt about my
heart.

to hide from him, for I was quite beside
myself, and that night you saw me on the
rock I thought he was running after me,
and I threw myself into the sea from
him. It was Connal O'Morven that
saved my life that night; I wish he had let
me die so he saved the child, for then he
would never have been brought to trouble

night he comes to the cabin, but not as

nor looks at the child, but he sighs as
if his heart was full; and once that he
was sitting at the door with his hands
over his face, I saw by the way he tossed
his hair forward when he got up he had
been in tears. Oh ! my lady, all I ever
suffered was nothing to that : my whole
generation is not worth one tear of his ;
and I am sure by the looks he gives me
I am some how the cause of it, and I dare
not ask him, my heart is so full, and I
have such a reverence for him: they are
not angry looks, but full of sorrow, and
when he smiles through them, sometimes
it is like a knife going into my heart,
and so I knew, since there was blame and
unhappiness some way, it was best for
me to tell the whole story, sad and
sbameful as it was, to your ladyship, for
all I wish is that O'Morven was happy,
and that I and my child were in the
grave.'
Again she burst into an agony of tears,

but she might have wept for ever un-
heard by Armida. Gasping with different
emotions, she said, mentally:
“ Is this innocence, or is it mockery?
Am I the object of derision even to this
creature, or may I not become so if I
utter another word ?"
Rosine, astonished and perplexed, ap-
plied to her in vain to answer the wo-
man.
“ I dare not speak to her," said Ar-
mida : “she has seen my heart: a wo-
man cannot avoid the penetration of a
woman.
Rosine thus called upon, said firmly-
“What reason have you for relating
your story to Miss Fitzalban, or imagin-
ing she could be interested in any thing
relating to O'Morven ?”
The woman appeared confounded, but
in a few minutes she said in a tremulous
voice,
"I will tell you, my lady, I will tell
you the whole truth, and what made me

intrude with my shameful story on sucfr
a noble lady. I saw OʻMorven whenever
he came to the cabin, and he had a
black rose in his breast, and he would
take it out and press it to his lips, and
to his bosom, as I would a child, and if
I a living woman, I saw that
flower, it is black velvet, in her lady-
ship's hair not ten days ago ; she wore-
it just on her white forehead: I knew it
well, though I saw her but once before
that night, and so I thonght-I don't
know what I thought, but that it was
best to tell her ladyship every thing, for
if O'Morren is not blamed I don't care
if I was thought the vilest wretch on
earth, as I am."
Armida now struggled in vain with
the feelings that overcame her: she would
have assured the woman of her protec-
tion, of her pity ; but she had no voice ;
and eagerly throwing her purse at the
woman's feet, she turned away.

Rosine retired, though reluctantly, and

cealed the struggles of pride and passion
in her countenance as she, advanced,
determined to hide the secret of her
heart, and force from her proud slave
the confession of her power.
He folded his arms, and coldly bowed
at her approach. The majestic submis-
sion of his figure touched her, and she
hastened to speak before her impressions-
of resentment were effaced, but just in
view was the very spot where he had
saved her life on the day of arrival at the:
castle, and she could only observe :-

“ You have indeed pre-
served my life, yet you could deliberately
devote it to wretchedness.”
Connal started.

"You saw me on the point of union
with a monster: you were acquainted
with circumstances that would have made
me renounce him for ever: you refused
to disclose thein : you resigned me to him
without reluctance: you could have pre-

" I dared not."
“ Dared not !” repeated Armida,
scornfully. “Do you fear Wandesford ?"
“ I fear no human being but myself.
When I suspect my own heart no tempta-
tions can urge me to yield to its dictates,
and would not others too have doubted
the motives I doubted myself.”
In these words · Armida felt she was
mistress of his fate, and determined to
exert her power to the utmost : she
demanded if he had disclosed the story
of the deserted woman : what motive
could the disclosure possibly have been
ascribed to, but that of common interest

for ever."
But had he dared to raise his eyes to
Armida while he spoke, he would have
seen no scorn in her
eyes, no banishment
in her lips.
Contending with her emotion, she
faintly asked :
“ Was it then a proof of passion that
be had refused by disclosing the story of

the unfortunate female to save her from
an union with Wandesford."
Yes, a proof of passion the most
exquisite: a proof that none but a heart
silent and devoted like mine could give.
Oh ! had I but uttered a word of that
story; had I but looked ; had I but
thought of it; a word, a look would
have betrayed the secret I would have
died before I had told; but could I
have borne to appear to you, to your
proud family, an officious slanderer, who,
destitute of claims, feeds his mean malice
by disturbing their peace.”
s Proud and selfish being!”said Armida,
mentally ; " his own feelings, his proud
reserve, his sullen dignity, is all he
values:" and she said aloud with haughty
irony :-" Is this the softness and sub-
mission of a man who loves? You strug-
gle like a lion in toils, and convert your
very homage into a reproach."
« Oh! what had I to do with love?"
exclaimed Connal, still more wildly;

last fragment, and stand alone: I will
sink not without a struggle, but with
out a murmur; thus hopeless, heart-
less, fortuneless--cut off from life, almost
forgotten by heaven, what have I to do
with love?"
Armida's resolution shook with every
word he uttered, and she collected its
last remains to say in a voice that con-

tradicted her language-of hopeless pas-
sion it was fruitless to prolong the pain
by complaint.
“ Yes,” said Connal, sadly, "we must
part; go like the sun to light other
worlds, and leaye mine in darkness; for
the one bright gleam you shed on the
existence of a wretch he will bless
you
for ever ; my long night will be without
a ray, but not without a dream : on my

edness and ruin, will think of you alone ;
will they love like Connal ?-oh! never,
never !"
Armida now felt she must tear herself
away, yet determined that this should
not be their final parting. She faintly
observed, if they must part, their parting
might at least be less abrupt, and nam-
ing the night of the fête, told him she
would be there.
** But I shall not be there,” said Con-
nal, retreating, and folding himself in his
mantle.
Confounded and incensed at this re-
fusal, she demanded if he had not been
invited.
Yes," answered Connal, gloomily,
"I have been insulted with an invitation,
but I will not go. The grandfather of
that woman was the servant of mine, and
grew rich by his spoils. Must I go to
see the plunder of my family shining on
her walls? I hate those revels. The

racked and wretched tenantry: the luxu-
rious beat you inhale is purehased by
their resting, after a day of toil, on the
naked floor of their hovels : the only
light of their wintry nights is borrowed
from the glare of the torches that con-
duct you to her feast. I hate those
revels. When folly is contrasted with
misery, its colour darkens into guilt.
The country is bleeding under ignorance,
poverty, and superstition, and we cast
over its wounds a gay embroidered gar-
ment of voluptuousness, beneath which
the heavings and shudderings of its
agony are but more frightfully visible."
Armida, who expected that the slight-
est bint of her presence would have made
him rush uninvited to meet her, imagined
that bis refusal arose from not under-
standing her, and in language that she
believed equal to a command, again in-
timated her expectation that he would
meet her there.

" I will not go,” said Connal, resum-
ing all his Milesian character.
" Once
I was there with my grandfather - I was
there to see him placed in the lowest seat
at her table, amid men whose fathers
feasted with his servants: and when their
splendid equipages came to convey them
home, I had to lead him through a crowd
of sneering, pampered ruſſians, who
grioned to see O'Morven with no other
support than the solitary arm of his
grandson. With one blow I felled those
who were nearest me to the ground, and
quitted her walls never to enter them
again."
Unused to opposition, Armida lost all
self-command at this refusal.

are withheld from me. The first request
I ever stooped to make is rejected to
my face: the only man I ever deigned
to solicit refuses to sacrifice an absurd
and savage pride to my intreaty."
“ To a Milesian,” replied Connal,
" the sacrifice of his life is trivial to the
sacrifice of his pride."
Armida contended no more, but, re-
tiring, in a broken voice she said ;-
“ You are right; I should thank you.
You dreaded my weakness : you feared
that yielding to the softness of the mo-
ment I might there have uttered some-
thing you would hear with reluctance ;
that I might have disclosed what our short
tumultuous meeting would not permit.
You have saved me perhaps from doing
what would have made me bate myself. I
have now no excuse for not bidding you

struggling through the cloud of pride,
anger, and shame, that darkened her
angel features.
She was retiring, when Connal, on
whom a new sun seemed to rise, sprung
forward, and with that mixture of awe
and boldness which love alone can teach,
detained her, while he knelt at her feet.
“ Armida,” he cried,
hate me.”
Armida struggled to release the hand
he held.
“ Armida, I adore you."
Her struggles insensibly abated.
“Armida, we must never meet again."
He sprung from the ground, and dart-
ing from her sight, disappeared in a mo-
ment.
Chilled, lost, annihilated, Armida re-
mained on the rocks alone. Was it
Connal she heard? Was it Connal who
quitted her ? Was it the man whose
prostrate homage, whose burning confess

drawó from her the secret of her heart?
Was it he who had voluntarily bid her
an éternal farewel! Neither her pride
nor love could sustain the shock. Her
reason was disturbed, and she continued
to repeat the words. We never meet
again,' without remembering their
meaning. At length the voice of Wan-
desford, who, much intoxicated, had
quitted his party, and had come out in
seareh of her, restored her recollection.
Starting with horror at the sound, she
flew from him with the swiftness of a
bird, and reached her apartment before
he could recognise who it was that had
escaped him.

sages of the castle, cursing, complaining,

spect, and who at last succeeded in per-
suading him to retire ; but it was so long
before she could accomplish this that she
did not get' to Armida’s apartment till
some hours after midnight. Armida
was reading; the tapers that burned before
her shed so little light through the vast
and sombrous chamber, that Rosine did
not mark her peculiar expression; and in
the burning spot that dyed her cheek, her
loose hair, and trembling hands, she
imagined she saw the confusion and the
glow of triumphant love. Agitated with
hope and fear, Rosine demanded the re-
sult of her conference with Connal. Ar-
mida made two or three attempts to
speak : at length, with a convulsive ef
fort, she said:
“ We have parted, never to meet
more."
" What can this mean?" exclaimed
Rosine in amazement. “Is this parting
the result of principle, or of some new
discovery ?”

" It would be easy for me,” said Ar-

vation. But wbile adjusting her gorge-
ous dress, her hands trembled while she
thought of the change in her character
since she had worn that habit, when, con-
scious of resistless loveliness and com-
manding talent, she seemed only to claim
and receive homage from every eye and
heart; while now, heartless, dispirited,
and deserted, she only wished to hide
from that admiration which contrasted
the neglect of one for whom she would
have exchanged all.
Wandesford, insensible alike to her
sufferings and her aversion, gratified bis
pride by the thought of his appearing in
the possession of so much beauty and
talents.
His vanity might indeed be indulged
by the contemplation of her beauty, for
never was it more resplendent; formed
to dazzle and to shine, ber dress was per-

figure, and the fixed expression of her

ing spectator the idea of intense and si-
lent suffering, gave the superficial one an
idea of calmness that suffered him at
leisure to contemplate features whbse
perfection any change almost seemed to
diminish.
In the mean time crowds arrived from
every part of the country. Though
Armida had resided some months in
Ireland, she had been seen but by few;
and the curiosity which her character,
her talents, her beauty, and her situation
excited, had never till this night obtained
a chance of gratification : all came alike
prepared to wonder, to admire, to envy,
and to discover defects. Of her beauty
there was but one opioion--an universal
murmur, almost amounting to acclama-
tion, announced the universal sensation.
Armida beard it, but no longer with
pleasure or pride, and the consciousness
of this change in her feelings deepened
her melancholy; but when the first gaze

motionless attitude wearied the eye, and
the youthful and animated beauty of
Lady Gabriella, though of a common
character, more than divided the admira-

same time the folding doors of the spa-

playing amid a blaze of lights the superb
harp and piano, so often sacrificed to
Gabriella's neglect: but this, by remind-
ing her of former scenes, only increased
her inability; and accustomed to exercise
her talents only when inspired by feeling,
she retreated with a timidity which was
for the first time falsely ascribed to pride;
this only jocreased the importunity that
assailed her, loudly mixed with Wandes-

less power to contend than even to com-
ply, she rose and placed herself beside
the harp. The attitude she assumed,
though unconsciously, formed so perfect
a picture, that the circle waited as if for
the strains of a muse they imagined they
saw. Formerly this admiration would
have excited ber talents, but since a
deeper sentiment had touched her heart,
it
gave
her no sensation but embarrass-
ment or pain. Her hands wandered over
the chords. The harp is adapted for airs
of expression, but with expression, or
any thing connected with emotion, she
dreaded to trust herself, and imagining
she had still sufficient powers to execute
difficulties, she hastily arose and went to
the piano. Wandesford placed a bravura
song of Catalani's before her, and re-
luctantly she begun the symphony.
Habit supplied the place of talent for a
time, and she sung a few bars with her
úsual excellence, but when she came to
the passages of execution, she found her

voice as much impaired as her musical
feelings; and the volubility and compass
that could once have filled a theatre
were totally gone.
Amazed and de-
pressed, she stopt, and saw on every
side
that painful expression with which ad.
miration contends with pity. Wandes-
ford now almost with oaths insisted on
her proceeding. Oppressed and intimi-
dated, she vainly declared it was impossi-
ble: he persisted, till looking round the
circle for compassion, her eye caught
that of Desmond, sparkling with some-
thing like a tear, and laying her damp
and trembling hand on his, she asked if
it were possible with such hands to strike
a chord.
** Impossible," cried Desmond, and
taking the hand she held out to him, he
led her away before Wandesford, who,
too much incensed to speak, did not fol-
low her.
Lady Kilcarrick seized on this unex-
peeted moment to place Lady Gabri:

trasting her forward compliance with the
caprice of Italian singers, where she
continued for an hour to exercise the
patience of her hearers, who in vain
wished for the relief of the broken but
exquisite notes of Armida.
The dancing now commenced, and
Wandesford, striding over to the remote
corner where Armida was seated, rer
minded her of her engagement to dance
with him.
"I do not intend to dance," said Ar-
mida, starting from a reverie, ana bardiy
recognizing the person who spoke to her.

your privileges, but abuse them; they do
not extend to insult yet.'
He seized ber reluctant hand and led
her to the seat; and Lady Kilcarrick, who
saw her dejected figure, anticipated a
Dew triumph for her darling Gabriella;
but here she was mistaken: voice is a
local quality, of which the slightest ac-
cident may divest the possessor ;
but
while Armida's figure retained life, it
was impossible it could lose its celestial
grace, and though to herself her move-
ments appeared lifeless and mechanical,
they converted the dancers almost into
spectators: but Wandesford, who re-
membered the animation, the vivid and
visible language of her action, when he
had seen her in Italy, and believing her
present languor to be solely the result of
caprice or contempt, whispered the
most insulting sarcasms to her with every
opportunity, and danced with a negli-
gence which filled every one with indige

pation but Armida: at length, at the
close of the set, he awkwardly en-
tangled part of his dress in her’s, and de-
tached it again with such rude violence,
that her light drapery gave way, and,
glad of an opportunity, she hastened
from the dance. Lady Gabriella, inward-
ly delighted at an accident that removed
her resistless rival, followed her with a
rude laugh, which was scarce concealed
by her affected concern at the accident,
and her offers to assist in repairing it,
Armida glanced at her dress, which
consisting of the slightest gauze over
silken drawers, had given way
direction, and accepted her offer to re-
tire to her dressing-room.
This room, like the rest, had been laid
out for company, but was now empty;
the lights burnt dimly through the thick
foliage with which it was adorned. The
coolness, the calmness, and the rich and
deeply shaded green of this little apart-
ment, presented a delightful contrast to

it these three winters, till the colour is
quite dead, and she bas raised the ghost

a large mirror was opposite to her"; in-
voluntarily her figure was presented to
her; her torn dress, the perfumed and
brilliant roses that had adorned it, hang-
ing on the ground; her hair, which had
been so lightly arranged, that the slight
motion of her dancing had loosened it,
and her rouge, whose unwarying, unim-
passioned dye seemed to mock the vicisa
situdes of feeling that wandered over her
mind.
The music, and the sounds of mirth
still reached her ear, and she thought,
with a kind of melancholy surprise, of
the crowds of trivial, upinteresting, un-
endowed characters, that, without a power
of communicating pleasure, could thus
busily enjoy it; while she, for whose ap-
proach pleasure seemed to wait as for a
signal, alone, neglected, deserted, listened
to its sound like an exile to the songs of
his native country. The mystery of her
fate seemed to oppress her like a spell;

again her eyes fell on the mirror; it dis-
played an image of beauty still perfect,
an expression of genius still unimpaired,
though clouded and dim : there was no
external cause for this desolation of the
heart, and she mentally asked whence it
proceeded. A voice from within her
uttered the name of Connal: it was a tone
of reproach. Connal, she repeated again :
softer recollections accompanied the
sound, and it was a tope of sorrow-alone,
unheard, no witness to check the wild and
weeping luxury of passion, she sighed
forth the name a third time-it was the
tone of love. A rustling noise in the
foliage started her-she turned : he
whose name she had called on (as if by

glance on the intruder that was intended
to transfix or strike him to the dust;
but that glance shewed him in an attitude

so hopeless, yet so pleasing, that sbe lin-
gered involuntarily.
“ That look bids me begone,” said
Connal, “ and yet I dare to stay. The
wretch who is self-condemned listens
without terror to his sentence: I have no
defence, no plea to offer. The madness
of passion urged me last night, when I
avowed the secret of my heart-pas-
sion to madness again brought me
here."
“ Have we not parted for ever?" said
Armida, repeating his words with melan-
choly triumph.
“ We have, we have,” cried Connal,
" and therefore I dared to venture here:
I had no hope, no wish to meet you: to
catch a glimpse of your form, to guess
even at its shadow, perhaps to hear the
sound of your voice, or even of your
name, to mix the sighs of passion and
despair with the incense that was breathed
around you, even though they could
never reach you-this was all I dared to

till I found this apartment had a com-
munication with them: I gazed on you
madly, believing I could retire from the
view when I would; but I heard you sigh,
and forgot erery thing. Oh! turn not
from me, I am humbled below seorn, I
am unhappy beyond all fear."
Armida lingered; he ventured to ap-
proach: “And can the brilliant enchan-
tress, amid these bowers of luxury, so
suited to the sweet spells she casts on the
heart and senses, cap she have cause for
a sigh ?”
“ The sigh was not for myself,” said
Armida, and she trembled lest she had
said too much.
« Oh! happy is he whose thought is
embalmed by your sigh," murmured
Connal.
“. Then let him be happy in my tears
too," said Armida, and they flowed un-
restrained.
". Oh! heaven," he exclaimed, rusk-

ing to her feet, “ do you weep, can you
weep : I thought you all pride and arti-
ficial feeling : I thought you a being
only formed for homage: one who if the
world was prostrate at your feet would
not stoop to bid it rise,”
* We were then mistaken in our views
of each other," said Armida, weeping
still. “ Oh! yet, yet, let me live on this
moment; let me impress it on my heart
for ever, that I beheld you weeping, and
still you weep.
For whom, oh ! for
whom are those tears"
• What avails it för whom are my tears
or smiles,” said Armida, "since your lips
have pronounced that we part for ever?"
« Oh! no,” said Connal, shuddering,
" it was my fate that pronounced it, the
mystery of my fortune, the thought that
is consuming my youth, and blasting life
to ny view : in the only moment of joy I
ever knew that thought came across me,
like a spectre. I started; I uttered a few

words of madness, and fled from you:
and even now," he cried distractedly,
" even now it visits meit tells me 'tis
madness to look on you, to listen to you,
to linger near you."
He retreated from her, and throwing
himself on the seat she had quitted, leaned
his burning forehead against its edge:
part of her drapery still rested on it: she
attempted to draw it away, and as he
raised his head to release it, he pressed it
passionately to his eyes and lips.”
Armida felt this was the last moment
she dared to stay: 5 Go then," said she,
in a broken voice, " and remember what
I would never have told you but in our
parting hour: she who weeps in secret
never wept for hatred.”
She was rushing away, but Connal
was already at her feet, speechless, trem-
bling, yet glowing and exalted. Speak,
speak again: may I–dare I think-is the
fate of the ruined Connal not indifferent ?

“ Must I speak,” said Armida, shed-
ding the softest radiance of her beautiful
eyes on him,
" must I speak to con-
firm it."
Oh! no, no, no," sobbed Connal,
prostrating himself almost on the earth,
and convulsively hiding his face in her
robe,“ utter not a word; I hear your
silence it is like the smiling silence of
the angel guide of whom the departed
spirit inquires his destiny."
There was a solemn, almost a sacred
joy in the pause that followed.
- You shall know all,” said Connal,
slowly raising his head :
know the dreadful secret of my heart
to-morrow: my waywardness, my melan-
choly, my despair ; you shall know
it all.”

The difficulties of fortune she believed

gotten in this triumphant moment. He
was still at her feet, when an approach-
ing step startled them; and Lady Gabriella
entering, exclaimed, “I thought you were
alone, Miss Fitzalban."
Though Armida would have avow-

clandestine appearance, and she said fal.

met before, readily believed them both,
and glided away, inviting them to follow
her.
do And will you not come ?" said Ar-
mida, extending her white band to
him.
He must have been more than man
who could resist her--her siren tone,
her attitude, at once voluptuous and timid,
intimating tenderness, and inviting to
pleasure ; her pride, her beauty, her pas-
sion, sparkling round her Calypso figure,
and blending the softness of the woman
with the splendour of the genji."
« Yes, I will go with you, enchantress,
exclaimed Connal : “ I care not for the
event, for what can to-morrow bring that
will not be lost in the remembrance of
this night."
He then hurried from the boudoir,
and Armida, after adjusting her dress,
followed, but she had recollection enough
to follow in another direction.

But what a different figure entered
the ball-room from that which had
quitted it-glowing, brilliant, her fea-
tures sparkling with the tremulous, with
the gem-like lustre of bope and passion ;
ber form almost too bright and light for
any element but air to support or to con-
vey; her very vestments seemed to un-
dergo a change like the Cameleon from
the air she respired ; and her whole figure
realized the fable of the statue converted
into woman by the charm of love. No
łonger shrinking into obscurity, she ac-
cepted the trembling hand that Connal
offered, and when they joined the set,
they scarce seemed beings of the same
species with those who surrounded them.
When the dance began, all the other
performers paused almost involuntarily.
Envy was stifled by resistless admiration,
and even applause by wonder. The per-
fection of their figures, the ease, light-
Dess, and enjouement of their movements,
the exquisite modulation of their atti,

tudes, that seemed to form a kind of
visible music, gave to the spectators the
idea of two descended genii mixing in
the festivity. The light movements of
Connal scarce disturbed a ringlet of the
glossy hair that fell on his white neck:
and as Armida’s nymph-like form glided
among the dancers, it appeared like a star
sometimes passing through the clouds,
sometimes sparkling as it emerged from
them: all gazed with delight, but the
anxious Rosine (who could as little ac-
count for Connal's appearance as for
Armida's sudden re-animation) and the
disappointed Gabriella.
The pressure of company towards the
doors announced the approach of supper,
and Connal, ignorant of the modern
eustom of the youvg, hurrying down to
secure the best accommodations, waited
with the reference of other days, till every
female had quitted the apartment. The
supper-room was completely filled when
he entered, but Lady Gabriella eagerly

displacing those near her, offered him a
seat next herself, but Connal slightly
bowing, placed himself at the back of
Armida's chair, and intoxicated with his
situation, forgot alike the luxuries of the
feast and the gaze of strangers.
Never had they appeared to each other
so resistless : that rose-coloured light
which a brilliant entertainment diffuses
on every object was more congenial to
the voluptuous splendour of Armida's
beauty than the gloom of rocks, or the
paleness of moonlight : and Armida, who
amidst all her passion revolted from the
chill and stern character of Connal, bis
apathy of life, and his contempt of lux-
ury, now amid scenes that renewed her
former existence saw him all she wished,
and like the sun-flower expanded in his
unclouded rays.
Lady Montclare, who had observed the
events of the night under her unvarying
mask of suavity, at length excited Lady
Kilcarrick to remove Connal from Armida,

but at the same time guarded her lan-
guage so artfully, that it was impossible
to urge her as authority, for the Lady
Kilcarrick, who knew but one way of
doing things, immediately approached
Conpal, and said plainly:
« Mr. O'Mor-
ven, your marked attention to Miss Fitz-
alban is bigbly offensive to Colonel Wan-
desford."
Connal started, but soon recovering,
said: “ Did Colonel Wandesford com-
mission your ladyship to give me this
information ?
Wandesford, who was near, relieved
Lady Kilcarrick from her perplexity, byde-
manding did he suppose he would contend
with him about Miss Fitzalban : « It is
useless for either of us to contend for an
object so infinitely superior to us both.”
Wandesford rejoiced something almost
unintelligible that intimated menace: the
proud reply that already spoke from the
eyes of Connal was prevented by a look
from Armida, who had listened with ter-

ror to their conference. He bowed si
lently, but he retained his station. Wan-
desford filled bumper after bumper of
Champagne till his spleen fermented into
something like courage, and he began to
pour forth 'a torrent of abuse against
Ireland, her natives, and her national
character. The cheeks of Connal and
Desmond faithfully reflected the glow of
their indignant hearts, and Desmond was
bursting into reply, when a glance from
his brother calmed and stilled him,
" There is a gentleman,” said Wan-
desford, pointedly addressing Connal,
who would persuade us of the potency
of an Irish bowl over all the music in the
world.”
" To one who is insensible of its ex-
cellence,” said Connal, “ it would be in
vain for me to impart the feelings which
heaven has denied them."
“Aye!” exclaimed Wandesford, with
a contemptuous shout,
“ I suppose your
country, like its ancient inhabitapts, is

trembling at the spirit her own enckant-
ments bad raised, called on Connal to
join her 'in the air which she had onee
heard him sing, accompanied by her lyre.
To Connal this public display was
hateful, but the spell of Armida's smile
was once more exerted, and though he
blushed with almost female sensibility at
the effort, he complied.
The rich, mingled, solemo stream of
sound that rose on the loud, tumultuous
gaiety of the revellers, húshed it in a
moment into that deep silence that is the
most audible language of pleasure. That

"
deep and heart-thrilling expression which
passion gives to the voice seemed to de-
velope new resources in it, even to the
singers themselves. Armida, accustomed
to the science and modulation of Italian
music, exerted all her powers to follow
the wild and indefinite cadences of the
Irish, and the exertion strongly resembled
the influence of her mind on his, pur-
suing its wanderings, and shedding sweet-
ness and brilliancy on its gloomy and
inaccessible wildness. The silence that
followed was only broken by Wandes-
ford's whispering to the officers some of
the lines of the air :
“ Are the sons of Erin so good and cold,
They cannot be tempted by woman or gold."
Connal did not hear him ; he appeared
indignant at the situation in which he
was placed, and no intreaties could pre-
vail on him to sing again, though the in-
treaties were enforced by Armida's looks :
“ How," he murmured," shall I sing the
song in a strange land?"

sal-
But though they ceased to sing, those
looks, so full of eloquence and passion
that they may be called the music of the
eyes, with which they viewed each other,
alarmed Lady Montclare, who, already
apprehensive of the notice which the effe-
minate beauty of Endymion, and the close
attention of Desmond to him excited, rose
abruptly to depart. As Armida retired,
she asked if her song had caused his sud-
den dejection:
" The mermaid,” said Connal,
ways sings sweetest before a storm.'
She belieyed these words to allude to
the secret he was to disclose at their next
meeting; and though she conceived that
her wealth and rank would obviate all
this dreaded secret could menace, yet
these ominous words sank into her heart.
During the journey home, the silence
was unbroken by a single word. On her
arrival at the castle, Armida flew to her
apartment: delighted and disturbed,
elated and trembling, she wished to taste

the luxury of passion alone. As she
passed through her dressing-room, she
caught a glimpse of her beautiful figure,
sparkling less brightly with all her jewels
than with love, hope, and triumph, and
she felt that confidence revive that she
never had known since she quitted Italy.
Every object around her appeared
tinged with a fairy light: she approached
the casement from which she had seen
him the first night of her arrival, as if it
was the confidant of her feelings, and
opened it to inhale the same air she bad
breathed that night. She remembered
she had seen him there, and she thought
that her imagination, concentred as it was,
had pictured to her the object with which
it was filled. She looked again: a dark,
figure stood in the shadow of the tower,
and a voice, hollow and deep, unlike the
voice of passion, pronounced her name.
65 Who is there?” said Armida: " who
calls on my name?
“ A restless and wandering spirit,"

answered the voice : “ Armida, the bur-
then of my heart can no longer be borne :
grant me a last request, and listen to me."
“ A last request !" repeated Armida,
faintly.
* The rushing of the tide drowns your
voice," said Connal: “ there is a flight
of steps from that tower to the rock:
come down, and listen to me."
Armida paused a moment; all was
still in the castle, and she descended the
steps, and, lightly dressed as she was,
stood trembling on the rock beside him.
The sad and solemn hour, contrasted
with the glow of their late meeting, em-
bellished by luxury and passion, struck
her imagination like an omen, and in
spite of all the confidence she felt in her
own power, she approached anxious and
dejected.
“ Is this the man," said she, over
whom my smiles and frowns have such
power? Is this he who bat an hour past
called me the arbitress of his fate?"

“ No, I am one who can yield do
longer to the intoxication of sense or of
fancy; a few hours must dissolve the il-
Jusion, and precipitate the disclosure that
fixes my destiny."
*. Why hours?” said Armida, trem-
bling: “oh! tell it now! What is this
mystery that I dread without knowing
it?"
" Is it a mystery,” said Connal, io a
broken voice, “that I am ruined ? the
last of a fallen race, on whose single head
the accumulated evils of past ages have
fallen, who, stupoed by the crash, is
looking round, not how to escape, but
how to perish with dignity."
Armida, ignorant of life and its diffi-
culties, scarce comprehended him, and
she said timidly :
" I have no experience; alas ! I know
nothing of life but splendour and luxury.
Is there no path to distinction for talents
and birth like your's ?"
• None: I know no art: I have no

am a Milesian, proud of blood, and
haughty of heart as any of those whose
pride has made me a mendicant, yet I
would lay hold on the plough, or the
oar: I would toil away my iron frame,
my swelling heart, till they became a
clod of the valley, could I earn bread by
tilling it.”
He stopped, but Armida, breathless
with emotion, attempted in vain to speak,
and he went on with the voice of one
who forces himself to confession :
Why should I hide it-I have tilled
the earth for bread. I told my grand-
father I was going on a pilgrimage, but

lad, who worked to maintain an aged
parent: always he abused, often he struck
this poor wretch. I told him I was will-
ing to undertake bis labour and my own:
from that moment he persecuted him with
more malevolence than ever. Once as
he raised his whip at him, I rushed on
him, and wrested it from his hand : foarn-
ing with rage lie caught it up, and aimed
a blow at me : yes, I felt his lash curl
round my body: the fire of bell boiled in
my veins : I seized the reptile, and rushed
with him to the briok of a river. Heaven
saved me from murder: I could have
crushed his life out with my single hand,
but the screains and terror of the wretch
made me feel him so despicable that my
passion was gone in a moment; I threw
him from me alive, and quitted the spot
and the attempt for ever.'
Armida’s feelings rising rapidly to a
-swell of agony, forbade utterance, and
he added in a deeper tone, and with
many a pause :

"My last, my only resource is to fly
to some country where the labour of my

sult, and without dependence, where
not one single chord of my heart will
vibrate to the tone of birth, or hopes, or
country more. For this I have been
long preparing, for this I am now pre-
pared: in a few days the last of the Mi.
Jesian race, quits the country for ever.”
At these tremendous words Armida's
resolution forsook her : ber pride, her
dignity, were all forgot, and wildly ex-
claiming:
"Must you go then ! Take me with
you, Connal!” she fell convulsed, but
not senseless, into his arms.
He clasped, he almost crushed her to
his burning heart.
“ Armida! angel! you follow a ruined
wretch to distant countries ! you bear the

flying from her that moment, she strug-
gled to hold him with her cold, convulsed
hands, wildly repeating :
« Then you believe all they told you
falsely of me: it is not true. My early
days were passed in pride and luxury; I
was a vain, proud girl, but I am no
longer so: it was all false and affected,
I can endure difficulty and want : I will
be your faithful, humble mate," she
cried, with increasing agony.
Wild as herself, Connal knelt beside
her on the cold ground, now strewed
with her sparkling ornaments : her head
rested on his bursting heart; his tears
dropped fast on her cold cheek. Never
in the pride of beauty was she so lovely,
never in the intoxicating moment of splen-
dour was she so dear: she lay on his bo-
som pale as a dying rose, whom no dews
can revive.

cannot love?"
“ Is this the hope with which we
parted ? Is this the light that shed rap-
ture on our last brilliant hour ?" cried
Armida. Oh, why," she exclaimed,
tearing off her ornaments in despair,
why do I wear this splendour, like a.
victim, attired for sacrifice ? Alas ! does
it become a wretch who supplicates for
life ?"
Her hair dishevelled, her gaudy dress
soiled and torn by the rock she koelt on,
she stretched out her arms to hini:
• Connal! Condal! by these tears, by
this despair-alas! I have nothing else
to plead with : I have no brilliancy, no
talents, no charms now. These frag-
ments are the emblem of my situation :
you have torn away the flowers from
life, and crushed them in the dust like
these."
Gasping and speechless, Connal gazed
on her,

< " This sight makes me a monster," he
murmured. Armida, spurn me, hate
me, bid me begone : where is your pride,

Alas! when I have sacrificed all the
dignity of my character and sex, why
should I spare my pride, why should I
spare a few fruitless words ? On my knees
I have implored you: the proud Armida,
whose heart no human power has ever
touched before, has knelt to you. What
can I do more?."
Then I will stay,” said Connal, with
dreadful resolution : " I will stay and
perish before your eyes.
“ But I have wealth enough,” said
Armida.
“I am bound to brave and faithful
men: I will desert them: I will stay, and
be a villain."
“I have wealth enough for all," again
repeated Armida.
Oh, God!" exclaimed Connal, in
the proud torture of his heart, “I must

hearts: I would sooner,” he cried, stamp-
ing with fury, “ I would sooner, like
wretches in a wreck, gnaw the flesh
off these-strong arms than suffer them
to fall idly by my side, while a wo-
man fed the descendant of Irish kings.
- Go then,” said Armida : “I am un-
able to contend: my knees are weary, my
struggles are over. Go, burdened with
my death, but never, never with my re-
proaches !”
A noise, like that of an opening case-
ment, reached their ears at this mo-
ment. Armida started, for she saw it
was in Wandesford's apartment, and
she adjured Connal to quit her in-
stantly.
" And, leave you exposed to bis insult,".
said Connal, indignantly.
« Oh, no, no; begone : it is your

I can reach my apartment in a moment.

Connal disappeared in a moment, and
Armida returned to her apartment with
all the speed terror allowed her, and extin-
guishing the lights, she stood watching
at the casement.

had been obliged to find his way through
the passages of the castle, appeared be-
low her window. He looked round in-

no longer : she hurried into Rosine's

the events of the night, and her present
terror.

dress, followed her, and they remained

ARMIDA, starting from her late and fe-

standing at her bed-side. She had at first
determined not to appear that day ; but
yielding to Rosine's remonstrances, she
rose, and descended to the apartment

at every sound, and listened every mo-
ment in the hope of hearing Wandes-

ceal her fluctuating complexion, she took
up a book ; but she bad hardly done so
when Wandesford entered the room, his
dishevelled appearance proclaiming that
he had not past the night at home.
He did not notice Armida; spoke
slightly to Rosine ; but addressing Lady
Montclare with unusual solemnity, de-
sired a few moments private audience
with her.
Lady Montclare, trembling, but exter-
nally calm, rose to grant it, and Armida
and Rosine were left alone aghast.

and solemnly approaching Armida, said--

and shame : or but I have no time to

“ Never !. never! Neither force, or

with stifled fury.

“ It is,” answered Armida, attempting
to quit the room, “and I call heaven to

" Then I call heaven and hell to wit-

room.
Armida sat still in despair ; and even
Rosine, terrified by these incessant scenes
of passion, lost all her resolution, and ex-
pressed her fears for Connal's safety.
“ And do you think, said Armida, ani .

Rosine,

then held, and they determined to send

and vindictive heart to doubt of his em-

Desmond was not to be found in the
castle, and Mr. O'Morven or the priest
she dared not trust, for both appeared
devoted to her mother.
The day was passed therefore in an
agony of suspense, which the silence of
Lady Montclare rendered insupport-

At dinner-time she slightly observed
that Wandesford would not return to the
castle for some days, and Armida, who lis-

glow that made the scene like summer to
Armida, he whispered,
“ Love has made me superstitious. A
thought wilder than a dream crossed my
mind this evening."
Armida listened with pleasure to the
confession of weakness, for she wished for
an excuse for her own,
“ The old harper," said Connal, “who
still follows our ruined fortunes, has
touched my imagination deeply. Amid
the night of age, and want, and blindness,
a spark of poetic fire burns in his soul.
Ill-fated man! he touches his harp in
empty halls, and wastes on the ear of age
sounds that might have roused heroes to
battle.
He played for me this evening; but
the martial airs I loved to hear wearied
me, and I asked him for airs of passion,
which his memory, long a stranger to
youth and love, had lost.

set on tales of woe or war: it is filled
with woman's love."
“ He needed no eyes to understand the
burning sigh that answered him: and he
implored with such vivid and prophetic
energy to hear her voice, that I yielded to
his wild request, and even came out to
seek you.
Often," he continued, leading her
onward, “ wben sitting on the grey stone,
or by the mossy tree, the only memorials
of the heroes of our house, he believes
himself iospired, and imagines that the

tion, for when labouring under the un-
certainty of fate, the strongest mind will
descend to the humblest resources.
He wrapped his mantle round Armida
to shelter her from the damp, and as they
moved slowly along the misty heath, Ro-
sine thought she had never beheld forms
so fair, so towering, so unearthly: their
majestic motion, their paleness, their
burning eyes that alone conversed, and the
dim and shadowy air that fell on them, re-
called to her fancy the tale of the Persian
princes emerging from the palace of
death to begin their flight to Para-
dise.
The scenery around had that pale and
misty look that fancy too might believe
the colour of that intermediate region
where the bounds of the invisible world
are miogled with those of life.
The old harper, seated on à grassy
caviu beneath a tree, was waiting for
them. His harp was beside him, and

branches above seemed like a prelude to
its mournful and neglected tones..
Their steps gave no sound; but he
turned his ear towards them with a quick-
ness that proved his hearing compensated
for the loss of sight.
Armida uttered an exclamation when
she saw him, for his flowing dress, his
long, wbite beard, his large, blue, sight-
less eyes, and his thin hair waving, like
snow drifted by a wintry wind, pre-
sented to her sight a being she thought
almost imaginary.
The old man's figure seemed illuminat-
ed by emotion at the sound of her voice,
for he believed that he knew the figure,
and even the character of the speaker
from its tones.
He spoke eagerly to Connal in Irish,
who as eagerly interpreted his words.
Daughter of beauty !” he exclaimed
in the impassioned language of his coun-
try," the sound of your voice makes me
bewail the loss of my sight again. Oh!

if my harp had but one string left, that
one string should be alive with your
praise."
He caught up his harp as he spoke;
but, long accustomed to sounds of sorrow,
he faltered in the attempt to revive those
bright and delicate tones that the pre-
sence of youth and beauty suggested.
« Fair lady,” said he timidly, “let me
feel your soft hand : its touch will re-
mind me of the time when my harp could
reach the heart, and the fair maids loved
its sound well : but pone so fair came to
listen when I could sing what was plea-
sant to the ears of lovers."
Armida placed her white fingers in his
withered hand, and they looked like
snow-drops springing from the brown soil
of winter.
He again touched his harp, and Con-
nal said with animated 'fondness,
“ Give us Cormac, the sweetest
song that ever was inspired by love and
beauty.

At the moment the old man bent over
his harp in a trance of feeling; a loud
blast of wind swept across the strings, and
the sound, deep and mournful, resembled a
human groan as it passed along the heath.
The old man shuddered : he dropped
the harp, and his sightless eyes rolled in
their sockets with a force that seemed
stronger than actual sight.
- The hand of the dead is on my harp!”
he exclaimed : " there is a spirit in the
air-the voices of other days strike my
ear-there is a spirit in the air ! I feel
his toucb on my heart! I see him though
I am blind! O'Morven, he whispers,
• No song of youth or love!'
O'Morven,
he bids me sing of woe and death!” ,,
Armida, trembling, grasped for sup-
port the arm on which she leaned.
“ Heed him not,” said Connal; “it is
the wind that sweeps the strings of his
harp
" It is pot the wind,” said the old man;
“ it is not the wind that bids me utter
these sounds."

And with the inspiration, the solemn
fury of a prophet, he struck the chords
that for centuries past had summoned the
funeral procession to the grave of an
O'Morven, and echoed the dreadful cry
that was raised over the corse.
Connal, with all his firmness, trem-
blingly alive to national superstition,
shuddered too. He led Armida away,
and they crossed the heath in silence.
It was now dark, and Armida, whose
mind, tinged by destiny and love, was as-
suming the gloomy colour of Connalis,
felt herself unable to resist the oppression
of this dreadful augury, and chilled and
trembling, her frame weakened by her
mind, she hardly suppressed the tears she
did not dare to let him see.
As they approached the castle, starting
from his trance, Connal implored her in
subdued tones to meet him the following
evening on the same spot.
“On the same spot !” repeated Ar-
mida, shrinking : “ah! do you forget

that spot has menaced us with woe and
death !”
« The heart is above all omens," said
Connal, passionately ; “ love is stronger
than death."
As he flew along the heath to his
lonely tower, he heard the sound of rapid
steps pursuing him. He turned, and
found himself clasped in the arms of some
one who fell breathless on his neck.
• Is it
you,
Desmond?" he cried.
No, no," answered a struggling
voice : “ I am all air, fire! I am in-
spired! I am mad !--Stay, Connal, you
shall not stir from this spot till I have
told all, or I shall run wild with rap-
ture."
Connal paused, and the rising moon
revealed his dark and agitated fea-
tures.
Desmond gazed on him for a mo-
ment.
“ I will not speak,” he cried, 'I will
not utter a word: you are not happy,

Connal turned his full, dark eyes on
him with an expression that at once
thanked and repressed his vivid sepsibi-
lity.
“ I am not happy, my Desmond ; but
while you are so, I cannot be very
wretched : but what is this itnelligence

“ What!- I cannot tell : I can hardly

“ Woman !--What woman?”

wandered to the castle, and got into the
chapel, imagining there was service there,
and wishing to hear its sounds once more
within those walls.. Lady Montclare and
Morosini are in the habit of passing
hours there, and as they are supposed to
be employed in devotion, no one intrudes.
They believed themselves alone, for
the old man
was kneeling in silent
prayer in an obscure corner, and in
their conference every thing transpired.
Endymion is a female : Lady Mont-
clare, banished from her husband because
she brought him no son, determined to
impose her on him for one: the priest
was her agent, and by his artifices Lady
Montclare delayed to introduce her to
her father till on his death-bed, when he
no longer discriminated her female figure.
They spoke of the difficulty of carrying
on the deception, and of their apprehen-
sion that Wandes ford or my father might
suspect hier sex, unless the former was

hours discussing their plans, the execu-

anxiously observing Connal's silence.

dispute our claims, and our lives might
be exhausted before his opposition."
Connal was silent still, « And Armida

heart would sink with the shame of her
father and her family.”
Connal with sudden emotion raised
his brother, and vowed he would perish
before he disclosed the secret.

“ And look here, Connal, look at this
delicious paper ; but recently it was put into

it is to say her: she invites me, invites me

eyes, to my heart: there is no name,
but I have thought of a name for her
already, the sweetest, the softest ever
borne by her sex; yet still, I love the
name of Endymion : I shall love it for

Connal, his cheek crimsoned with re-

But she will not long be so," in-

" Libertine !” exclaimed Connal.

vain ? Is this the heart of a brother ? For
months past I have never closed

burn-

I am worn to a shadow : I am dying of
passion. Connal, have you no mercy:
would you dash the drop of water from
the lip of a feverish wretch who must
drink or die?"
" Yes, if it poisoned him, and his re-
covered life would bless me for it.”
“And would you reject it, if Armida's
hand held out the drop of refreshment to
you?"

cried Connal, with proud indignation,

Guilty !” repeated Desmond.
“ Yes, guilty: what is the object;
what is the hope with which you seek
her? Ah! Desmond, that guilt that
hides itself even from imagination is
the first that presents itself to opportu-
nity."
“ My heart is at this moment as pure
as your own," cried Desmond, proudly;
“I will but clasp her to it; I will but
tell her it beats for her.”
“ You will press her to that heart?."*
said Connal, placing his hand to his
brother's bosom, whose audible pulsa-
tion had struck him in every pause of
speech. " Then you are undone, and
she will be undone; she whom
you
love.

tempted to seize his hand.

it necessary to force himself to passion.
" I' despise the humility that only masks
an usurped power.
Despise me if you will, to-morrow

Oh, Desmond !” said Connal, his
eyes fast filling with tears at this une
natural reproach. He choaked the strug-
gling emotion, and grasping his brother's
hands, said firmly:
- You shall not go."
“ Shall not !” said Desmond, fiercely
struggling with him. In the contention,
Conpal, who could not hurt him, released
his arm suddenly, and the recoil struck
him on the lips with such force, that
"they were instantly bathed in blood.
“ Desmond, thus bleeding from your
hand, thus more than lacerated by your
words, you are still my brother; still
the boy whom I love so well. Oh! let
not this night say how vainly--I will
not be provoked, but I will not be
resisted.”
“ You will not be provoked !” said
Desmond, madly: "then take that.”

“ Desmond,” said his brother, starting
from him, to shun. the temptation that
trembled in every nerve, “at this mo-

in safety; but go not to shame and
danger : to-morrow you will weep on

“ Never : I renounce all connexion,
all intercourse with you. I abjure you ;
I abhor you: tyrant and no brother."
And he flew with the speed of light-
ning from the heath, for he dared not
trust himself with another tone of Con-
nal's voice.
“Cruel boy; return, return-even to-
morrow; return no longer innocent, but
even repentant, and my arms shall be

and redoubled his speed to escape the
tones that recalled them so loudly and
bitterly.
Disastrous love, violated friendship,
and hopeless fortune, rushing together
on the mind of Coppal, for a moment
overbore its firmness. He threw himself
on the heath, and hiding his face in his
mantle, wept. The night grew stormy:
the wind scattered bis dark locks : the
rain beat on his bare breast: better ac-
customed to the elements than to man or
woman, he felt their rough greeting like
that of a friend, and refreshed and
strengthened by what would have sent
half of his sex shrinking to shelter, he
spread his arms to catch the blast that
cooled his burning breast and throbbing
head. It was already past midnight,
when the sound of horsemen galloping
over the heath struck his ear: he turn-
ed: the party passed him, and in a few
moments the castle gates were thrown
open, and by the light of the torch which

the porter bore he saw Wandesford and
his servants alight and enter. The
gate remained open, and soon another
figure rushed out. Connal saw its dis-
tracted movements : it approached: the
moon fell strongly on it. Connal's heart
beat strongly: it was Desmond: he
threw himself on the ground, and his
deep groans struck on the heart of Connal.
A spark of passion burned there for a
moment: in a moment it was extinguish-
ed, and he rushed to his brother.
“ Desmond, you are unhappy, and
you are no longer guilty in my eyes."
The wretched boy clung to the cold
ground: he heard his brother, but he
dared not meet his injured eye: he
shrunk from his upbraiding touch.
Desmond, Desmond, dearer to my
heart than ever; if unfortunate, even if
guilty, still foo dear : speak to me; rise
from the earth; rise and tell me is that
unhappy girl still innocent."
“ More innocent than I dare utter."

Sobbing with emotion, burning with
gratitude, Connal spatched his brother
from the earth, and held him to his
heart.
" Am I clasped in these arms again,
cried Desmond, agonized with contri-
tion, “the arms I flew from; the heart
I trampled on?"
“ It was a 'moment of madness, Des-
mond; perhaps I did not deal mildly
with you: we will both forget it: at
this moment I forget every thing but
that you are innocent."
“Oh! no, no I was as guilty as I
could be: that letter was not from her, it
was from
" From whom?" cried Connal.
• Ask me not to disclose her name,"
said Desmond, while the moonlight, pale
as it was, shewed his young cheek dyed
in crimson. “I will never utter it; I
will never encounter her sight; never
sleep under her roof again. Connal, can
you shelter me for one night: I will

There sleeps the innocent object of my
love," he continued with a burst of
anguish, “sleeps without a thought of
the wretch whose heart is breaking for
having even in imagination doubted her
purity: yet, oh! yet, that she knew the
consolation that I feel in the thought that
she is so pure."
He dried his hot tears, and conyul.
sively tore himself from the view of the
castle.
Connal, can you shelter me for one
night; had they not turned me out, I
would never have entered the den of
that sorceress more: but now I have no
home but this heath-no shelter but these
rocks; let me rest my burning head any
where this night, and I will quit this
place to-morrow for ever.'
Connal seemed to pause at this request,
but recollecting himself, he bid his
brother follow him, and led the way
towards the cavern, Desmond, exbaust-

ed by emotion, and upable to contend
with the storm that raged on the bleak
shore, threw his arm over Connal's
shoulder as they walked.
“ Is this,” said he, shrinking,
support I am worthy of; is this the
posture I should assume: oh! no-on
my knees I should have supplicated
before I dared even to approach you.”
" For shame, for shame, Desmond, are
we not brothers ?."
“Yet you knelt to me,
knelt to me,” said Des-
mond, tortured by his very penitence.
“ I knelt to heaven when you were
gone, and my prayers were heard; you
were preserved from guilt.”
They reached the cavern: the tide was
out; and darkness and silence formed
an awful contrast to the agitated passions
of the intruders.
“ Here you will be safe,” said Connal,
in a voice of such chilling solemnity as
seemed inspired by the genius of the
place: “but I must leave you for a few

remain here."
Desmond listened to the sound of his
receding steps, till fancy was wearied in
following their track, and he wished even
for their echo to relieve the intolerable
loneliness of the place.
An hour elapsed before he returned,
and silently led his brother to a recess
where some art seemed to have been
employed to form a resemblance to a
domestic apartment. The roughness of
the rocky walls had been removed : a
turf fire burned in a niche: there were
books and lights on a rustic table. Des-
mond gazed around him, and Connal, as
if to anticipate inquiry, demanded the
events of the evening.
• The moment I discovered my dan-
ger,” said Desmond, blushing, “I flew
from the spot ; she called, she tried to
detain me. Oh! Connal, I cannot dwell
upon that guilty, that horrible moment.

I felt had Endymion been there-Oh!
Connal, you were revenged that moment:
I knelt on the ground, and uttered a
solemn Vow never more
more to endanger
Endymion's peace by my presence.
“I have little merit for this resolu-
tion. It is impossible after the discovery
of this night that I should ever again
appear at the castle ; but as if every
demon of hell had conspired to drive me
mad to-night, as I was rushing out my
father met me, and-oh! Connal, how
shall I utter it-commanded me never to
see you more.”
“ My father !” repeated Connal, in
amazement.
“ Yes, I was too distracted to attend
to what he said, but he talked of some
offence you had given to his friend Colonel
Wandesford.”
" His friend ! a man that has treated
him before my face with an insolence that
made the blood boil in my veins.

I saved."
Again he importuned Desmond to re-
peat the subject of his conference with
his father, and Desmond, shrinking again,
repeated his unnatural injunctions.
Connal silently continued to walk up
and down the cave.
My dear Desmond," said he, at
length, “ I am not able to speak to you
to-night. There is your bed of moss :
it is all I have to offer you. Sleep there,
my Desmond, and may no thoughts visit
your dreams like those'which take away
rest from me.”
Desmond threw himself on his rustic
bed, and though too much agitated to

sleep, willingly closed his aching and fe-
verish eyes.
“ He sleeps," said Connal, bending
over him a few moments after: " how
calm and heavenly is the sleep of youth!
He is happy, for he knows but one pas-
sion : no bloody and mortal summons will
wake him to the strife of life and death,
of honour and shame. Desmond, those
bright hairs will never be soiled with the
dust of a scaffold ; that young form never
will meet the gaze, and rage, and curses
of a rabble. Oh! there is a blessing
even in evil, when it does not reach to
those we love."
He then threw himself against the side
of the cave, and hiding his face with bis
hand, remained silent. In a few moments
Desmond heard him quit the cave, and
by the sound discovered he was descend-
ing a flight of steps, A murmur of
voices then struck his ear: they were
sometimes loud, and at times winding

among the echoes of the vault, Desmond
imagined he was deceived by the wild and
indefinite sounds of the wind. Restless
with
many
emotions, he rose, he listened,
he examined the cavern: in one corner
he observed a cavity; the light of the
half-extinguished fire fell dimly on it,
disclosing a flight of steps which Des-
mond for a moment was about to descend.
As he paused irresolutely, the sounds
ceased, and the last flash of light falling
on the cavity, rendered it impossible for
Desmond to penetrate its depth : he re-
treated, and his weariness both of body
and mind overcoming his curiosity, he
again threw himself on his bed of moss.
Frequently bis slumbers were broken by
the sound of voices from beneath, and
more than once he thought by the clash
of arms.
When he awoke, the beams of morn-
ing had broke through the cavern, and
Connal was sitting beside him in an atti-
tude that shewed he had not slept all

night. Fevered, bewildered, and unre-
freshed, he rose, and hastened to the en-
trance of the cave to cool his parched lips
with the air of day. The morning, cold,
calm, and grey, after the storm of night,
resembled that sullen repose which the
mind feels after the conflict of passion.
“ What is your present plan ?" said
Connal, as they stood at the entrance of
the cave.
My only object last night,” said
Desmond, “ was to fly from this place;
but I am now resolved to join my re-
giment: its quarters are but a few miles
off, and the hurry of a military life may
benumb my feelings; perhaps some wel-
come summons may
terminate
my
life be-
fore it is further embittered or disgraced
by a passion that I cannot resist, that I
cannot even contend with.”
Connal, with the eloquence and the
benignity of a ministering angel, tried to
sooth and strengthen him in vain. The
parting hour arrived ; and wildly calling

“Go, Desmond,” said his brother,
trembling for his stability;
your resolution is yet a virtue: in a few
hours it may be impelled by necessity,
and then it will be virtue no longer. Go,
and remember, whether tempted to weak-
ness, or summoned to danger, you are an
Irishman, and an O'Morven : however
it may please heaven to dispose of your
fortunes or your feelings, may your ho-
nour at least be immortal."
A crimson flush tinged the wan cheek
of Desmond, as he listened to his brother.
“I have nothing of value to give you,
my Desmond; but had I all the treasures
of the earth I give you more in this little
volume. (He drew it from his bosom as

not penetrate : his gloomy irresolution,
his vicissitudes of passion and melancholy,
his flying from her while he almost wor-

at this mysterious character, while she
longed to develope, and dreaded the reso-

powers to precipitate. The day was

the castle in the morning, and this stille
ness increased the agitation of Armida.
Wearied by that intolerable effort which
confines us to society from which our
hearts are worlds away, Armida thought
the evening prolonged for ages. At length
Lady Montclare retired, and Armida
alone hurried to the spot where Connal
was to meet her.
It was almost dark: the clouds of an
autumnat evening mingled their
heavy masses with the dark ocean, a bleak
wind swept along the rocks, and the sigh
of the moss and the thistle as it bowed
their heads, with the distant shriek of
the sea-bird, were the only sounds that
reminded her of life as she traversed the
shore. Alone, pale and shrinking from
the chill and cheerless air, how different
was she now from her who hitherto re-
spired only the brilliant and balmy air of
the south, whom even their genial wind
had never been suffered to visit too rough-
Jy, and whose steps had only pressed the

perfumed and velvet path of luxury.
Insensible to the gloom that gathered
round her, she continued to walk, in vain
straining her eyes to discover through the
mist a glimpse of Connal's figure. Night
came on, but the agitation of her heart
prevented her perceiving it: that form
which could make midnight noon still
hovered in her imagination, though her
eyes could not discover bim; and the in-
creasing darkness, by excluding every
external object, only concentred her mind's
eye on the object which filled it.
A step was heard on the heath : she
started and turned, and almost before she
saw him, Connal grasped her in bis arms.
Dark as it was, sbe saw with terror his
distracted figure, his bare, dishevelled
head, and his features, in which the sub-
limest expression of character contended
with despair.
Her heart told her this was no meeting
of love, and she in vain tried to collect
voice to speak to bim.

to hold them, she sunk on the ground at
his feet.
Oh, God !” cried Connal, throwing
to heaven his strained and blood-shot
eyes, “ let me but bear this like a man ;
let me not meet my foes bereft of all

" Oh! leave me not to die here,"
cried Armida, writhing at his feet in her
ravings ;. “ a single blow will end my
misery, and yet you delay, and yet you
leave me to die : your hands are strong,
and yet you have not the mercy to end
me.'
Connal, beside himself, knelt on the
ground: he attempted to raise her, but
at that moment the alarm-bell rung out,
and the discharge of musketry burst on
his ear like thunder. He started, and
through the darkness of the night he saw
the flames bursting from the old tower,
and spreading their burning volumes on
the air,

voice to make herself heard.
Drenched by the rain, and breathless
from struggling with the wind, she con-
tinued her dreary progress alone till the
flames that issued from the burning tower,
glaring widely on the dark heath, shewed
something white stretched before her on
the ground. She hastened forward : it
was Armida, pale, motionless, and pros-

sessing every distinction of rank, genius,
and beauty, in a situation so helpless and
deplorable, Rosine, almost execrating
Connal, knelt beside her, and attempted
to raise and revive her.
Armida recognized her voice. She re-
covered, and her mind overcoming her
weakness, her recollection returned in a
moment with her reason.
• Is this terrible dream over?" said
she, with a ghastly smile; " I know you
you are Rosine: but where is Connal?”
Rosine exerted all her strength to raise
and lead her from the spot, for the noise
came nearer, and she could distinctly see
the troops approaching by the light of
the burning tower.
But all her intreaties were answered
by the inquiry—“ Where is Connal ?”
Rosine then trembling, confessed what
she had heard that an insurrection had
broke out, military law had been pro-
claimed, and troops had marched that
evening to search the tower in which the

O'Morvens lived for concealed arms, on
the information of Wandesford; and
pointing to the burning ruins which the
soldiers were now quitting, she implored
Armida to fly from this scene of violence,
before insult or danger reached them.
Of all she said, Armida appeared to re-
tain but one sentence.
Ignorant of the distracted state of Ire-
land, she did not comprehend the rest ;
her heart had room but for one image-

horrid crash, and then rose in erect and

image of Connal engaged in a conflict
with numbers who overpowered him.

Rosine, unable to contend with or to
support her, flew to the castle for assisto
ance, and she was at length conveyed to
her apartment.
The castle and the whole country were
now in a state of alarm. The report was
universal that a rebellion had broke out,
of which Connal was one of the principal
leaders. The troops who had marched
from the town where they were quartered

were now dispersed over the country
searching for arms, and taking up sus-
pected persons.
The alarm-bell of the castle rung all
night, and was loudly answered by that
from Lady Kilcarrick's mansion, which
they could distinctly see illuminated as a
beacon to the neighbourhood: the wretch-
ed inhabitants of the few cottages in
the neighbourhood came flying for pro-
tection to the castle, which was now for-
tified as if for a siege ; the draw-bridge
drawn up, the windows secured, all the
servants whom they could depend on
armed for defence, and the family re-
treated to the most remote and best de-
fended parts of the building. Lady
Montclare and the priest retired trem-
bling to the chapel, but the elder O'Mor-
ven, with something of the spirit of his
family, presided at the directions given
for the security of the castle, and at-
tempted to tranquillize the family by as-
surances of safety.

Some of the attendants who were posted
on the turrets of the castle about mid-
night exclaimed that they saw the king's
troops scattering the rebel forces in every
direction, that the tower was in ashes,
and scarce a man was now to be seen on
the heath. Apprehensive that the rebels in
their retreat might assault the castle, the
guards were doubled on every side, all
the lights in the front of the building

able from the heath : the other sides, sur-
rounded by rocks, were imprégnable to
forces who wanted artillery. A few
moments after an express from Wandes-
ford arrived at the castle. He was ad-
mitted with caution, and darkened with
blood, and smoke, and toil, he presented
a frightful picture of the conflict to the
inhabitants of the castle, who crowded
around him. His first intelligence re-
moved their fears : he announced that on

the tower where the O'Morvens lived
being invested by Wandesford's regiment,
a formidable body of rebels, well armed
and disciplined, had appeared to defend
it, but as their efforts were more directed
to preserve the building than to assail
the troops, they had been quickly routed,
and the tower reduced to ashes. Rallying
at some distance, under the conduct of an
unknown leader, they had made a vigo-
rous defence, and though half of them
had been cut to pieces, and the remainder
wounded, by the steady and well-directed
fire of the soldiers, yet by the skilful
conduct and supernatural courage of their
leader, they had succeeded in securing
their retreat to the recesses of a wild
mountain, at the distance of two miles,
from which it was impossible for the
forces that had pursued to dislodge them.
Here, therefore, they had paused for the
night, after sending expresses
in
every
direction for assistance, of which one,

taking the castle in his way, had stopped
for a few moments to announce that their
immediate danger was removed.
Rosine, who, with the trembling inha-
bitants of the castle, had hurried to the
hall to hear the report of the express, at
once comprehended the dreadful mystery
of Connal's character, and not less dis-
mayed, even for the awful events of the
night than for that of Armida's ill-fated
passion, she hastened to her apartment
before the precipitation of some terrified
domestic should disclose the intelligence.
She found Armida, though unable to
quit her bed, and though every attempt
to speak was convulsive, yet resolutely
determined to listen and to inquire into
every particular of that dreadful night,
Her total ignorance of the state of Ire-
land, a country of which she had never
thought till she became an inmate of it,
made her slow in comprehending what
Rosine told her. At length she seemed
to understand it all, and hiding her face,

she suok back on the bed in silence.
Rosine tried to give her the hope she
wanted herself, by intimating that this
unknown leader might perhaps be some
stranger.
Armida shook her head incredulously:
“ Ah! that super-human courage,
said she, “can belong to but one man
on earth. Oh !” she added after a pause,
" Oh ! that I had beheld him on the dark th
mountain's side, when he gathered his
broken band, and told the proud tide of
pursuit-hitherto shalt thou go, and no

her again delirious,

“ To follow him," said Armida,
speaking with difficulty, but with perfect
decision, to follow this fugitive, this out-
cast, this rebel to the mountain, to the
end of the earth."

Rosine long expecting this fatal reso-
lution, heard it now without surprise,
but not without grief and horror : "Oh!

úry, talk of following the desperate for-
tuncs of a rebel leader : the wind of hea.
ven was not suffered to visit you roughly
in your youth, and how will
you
bear
the storm in its fury ?”
“ Rosine,” said Armida, faintly but
resolutely, “ do not weep for me, I am
past the kindness of friends : let me be
forgotten by the world, I shall never
embellish it more. I am no longer the
ambitious sparkling female who lived
only to the world and to fame: I am a
woman overcome by passion and destiny:
I am embarked in a wreck, yet I do not
cast one look toward the shore.”
Rosine continued to weep and to
supplicate, but Armida interrupted her.
" I have nothing now to require
of you, Rosine, but secrecy: perhaps

your principles may oppose this ; you may
think it your duty to betray me, but I
warn you it will be in vain : I do not
want resolution, and I cannot want the
means to execute it long: alas ! I feel I
am strong only in despair; had life any
charms for me I should value it more.'
During the remainder of the night
she was frequently and alarmingly ill,
but at every interval of ease she recur-
red to her purpose, and spoke of it with
a calmness, that while it removed Rosine's
apprehensions for her reason, awoke
others even more dreadful.
Almost as soon as it was light she rose,
and with incredible exertions prepared
to meet the family, who had none of them
been in bed all night; and now assembled,
at the first dawn of morning, were anxi-
ously waiting the arrival of an express
from Wandesford.
The danger and terror of their present
situation seemed to concentre all their
different and opposite feelings into one

mass of gloom and apprehension. Little
was said except by O'Morven, who,
equally regardless of the fate of one son,
and the absence of the other, seemed, like
all his countrymen, to feel his spirits
raised by the approach of danger,
and displayed that mixture of spirit
and unfeelingness that is common to them
all.
The day was past in wandering silently
from room to room, viewing the country
from the casements in the turrets, which
being beyond the reach of assault, were
not secured ; in vain exploring the bleak
and empty heath for the sight of the mi-
litary party they expected to be quartered
in the castle for its defence, and at times
listening to the heavy roll of the waves,
whose sound they imagined the discharge
of distænt artillery.
Evening at length arrived, doubling
the terrors of which she who felt the
most bad spoken the least, when the ar-
șival of a party of soldiers was announced

by the servants who were stationed on the
turrets of the castle: the intelligence they
brought removed their immediate fears,
though they represented the disturbance
as much more serious than was at first
imagined.
The rebels had in the night broke from
their retreat in the mountains, and attack-
ing the troops that pursued them, re-
pulsed them with considerable loss : a
strong detachment, commanded by a gene-
ral officer, bad marched that morning
from Galway against them, and Wandes-
ford's party, who had suffered so severely
in the engagement and pursuit, were re-
turning to their former quarters in the
neighbourhood. He himself had been
slightly wounded, and purposed if his
presence was not necessary at the scene of
action to return to the castle and make
that his quarters for a few days. Intel-
ligence had been sent to Dublin to ap-
prise government of the state of the
country, and troops were marching in

every direction to their assistance; but
they had not yet been able to discover
that any disturbance had existed in the
adjacent counties, or that there was any
connexion between this and the rebellion
of 1798. It seemed like Emmet's insur-
rection, the isolated and hopeless attempt
of a single enthusiast.
Orders had just been given on the ad-
mission of the soldiers to secure the castle
for the night, and O'Morven and Moro-
sipi were gone to inspect its execution,
when a carriage was heard driving ra-
pidly into the court, and in a moment
Lady Kilcarrick rushed into the room in
an agony of distress. In this hour of
terror, the sight of distress produced in.
stant sympathy, and though every one
disliked her, they all gathered round her
with expressions of concern.

carried her off to those wild horrid moun-
tains, to live with ruffians and rebels, and
with himself, the worst of them all."
“Whom do you speak of?"cried Lady
Montclare with unfeigned amazement.
“ Whom! why Connal O’Morven; he
has seduced my child ; taken her froin me :
my Gabriella--my child, whose rank and
beauty and accomplishments might have
entitled her to the first families in Ireland:
oh! the honour and comfort of my age is
gone; I am ruined and undone for ever:
oh! that he had the mercy to kill me
before he had done this. I hope I may
live to see him on the highest gibbet in
the country, like a rebel and a villain as
he is. As old as I am, I hope to see
that day, and so I will ere long, if grief
does not kill me."
Lady Montclare, whom even danger
could not divest of art, loudly joined
in her lamentations and invectives, while
Rosine, thunder-struck at this intelligence,
of which it was impossible to doubt, sat

bereft for some moments of all reflexion,
and when at length she raised her eyes to
look for relief on those around her, she
perceived Armida had quitted the room
without uttering a word. She rose me-
chanically to follow her, yet when she
reached the door, she retreated and sat
down in that sick and hopeless state of
mind in which we seem no longer to
know good from evil, in which charac-
ters change before us like figures in a
dream, and the landmarks of life appear
to be removed from their places.
She was startled from her reverie by the
sound of Armida's steps--she then ven-
tured to enter : Armida was walking up
and down the room rapidly but silently :
her step was firm, and but that her bair
hung loosely on her shoulders, there was
not even a trace of emotion in her
i figure.
In a few moments she was astonished
to see her approach a glass, calmly
arrange her bair, and throwing on her

ventured to inquire where she was
going
« The air of this room oppresses me,”
said Armida, evidently speaking with
difficulty, “and I think I can only
breathe in the
open
air.”
The passages of the castle that opened
on the sea-shore had not been secured
like the rest, for in that direction no
danger was apprehended, and they reach-
ed the rocky terrace, where Armida so
often walked without observation,
Rosine, as they walked along, placed
herself instinctively on the side next the
sea; and though it was twilight, she saw
Armida’s haughty smile of contempt at
this involuntary movement. The night
advanced ; it became dark and cold; and
the spray of the sea reached them, wet-
ting their light garments at every step ;
yet Armida continued to walk till it was
totally dark, and then, as if she had
waited for it, she hastily traversed that

side of the terrace, and descending, enter-
ed on the heath.
Rosine, now forced by her fears to
speak, mentioned the intelligence of the
day, and the probability that some
stragglers from the rebel camp might be
in the neighbourhood.
Armida walked on swiftly, without
appearing to hear, but at length she
said:
“ What were you saying of the rebel
forces ?"
Rosine mentioned the loss they had
sustained, and the strong party ordered
against them.
" Their leader is bold and brave,”
said Armida, " but conscience will sub-
due the boldest.”
And she continued to proceed so swift,
ly that Rosine could hardly keep pace
with her. ,

which were nearly a mile from the castle,

no longer able to suppress her terrors,
she exclaimed:
“Good Heaven! Armida, where are
you going? or what is it you purpose to
do? Alone at night, and in a country
like this, what will become of us should
we meet with danger ?"
“ We are so wretched,” said Armida,
with a soul-drawn sigh,
" that no one
will injure us.”
“Do you know where we are?” said
Rosine, as she tottered through the frag.
ments of the tower : " here has been
death but a few hours past. Do you see
the darkness? do you hear the storm ?
and yet this is nothing to what we may
meet."
“ There is no difference between day
and night to me, between storm and

or will be soon."

me more than even night and our forlora
situation. Oh! Armida, before you leave
me dying with terror, think where you
are going, and what is it you pur-
pose.”
“I know not where I am going or
what I intend,” said Armida, pausing,
and wringing her hands in the extreme
of suffering : "if my strength does not
fail me, I will hear my doom from his
own lips. A last appeal to his heart, even
if it should end in my death, will be
better than thus dying by inches away
from him, and listening to reports that
tear me to pieces like demons. Perhaps
when he sees me he will not deny com-
passion to the dying hour of the woman
he has destroyed."
She still continued to hurry onward,
and Rosine now followed implicitly,
terrified to proceed, yet more terrified to
return alone: she felt as if Armida's fate
at last governed her's.
As they passed the ruins of the tower,

the moon broke faintly through the clouds,
tinting its grey fragments with a sepul-
chral light, and revealing the long track
of bleak and barren heath that lay be-
fore them.
As they hastened on, with a speed far
above the strength of either, they be.
held the mossy stones and the withered
ash-tree under which but two nights
before Asmida remembered her fate had
been announced by the aged barper.
This sight overcame her, and tottering
towards it she sunk on the stones, and
supported her head against the trunk of
the tree.
" Alas !" sbe cried, “is this the first,
omen of my disastrous journey. Here
woe and death were announced to me,
and my heart verifies the prediction.
Ah! with what hope can a woman sup-
port herself who goes to revive passion
that never felt, or soon forgot it. These
stones are not more cold than his heart,
these branches are not more withered

than mine.. How different was I even
the last sad night I was on this spot :
then the gloomy prediction I heard terri-
fied me, but it did not destroy all self-
confidence, nor did it make me doubt
him. How vast is the interval between
even our worst fears, and the actual
burthen of evil when it arriver."
Rosine, though weeping too, seized
this moment of calm to represent the
danger, the terror, and the desperation of
her present enterprize ; the improbabili-
ty of meeting the leader of a rebel
army amid inaccessible mountains, and
the still greater, that amid scenes of tu-
mult and horror such as he was now
involved in he would listen to or feel
for her.
« Ah !” said Armida, her voice grow-
ing fainter and ber cheek paler at every
word, “ that is all I wish for; let me
hear my fate from his own lips if he can
pronounce it: perhaps he will be spared
even that trouble, if the old man's pro-

phecy should be true: if I perish here,"
she added, leaning her cold cheek on Ro-
sipe's breast,“ let it be told that life and
fortune courted me in pain, for my
heart
was on the dark hill's side with Con-
pal."
So shrunk was her form, so broken her
voice, that Rosine believed her actually
dying, and in her terror screamed aloud
for assistance, though conscious nons
was near.
Yet affrighted as she was, her terrors
were increased by the sound of approach :
ing footsteps, and she would have given
the world to be again left to the solitude
she dreaded so much a moment before.
The steps approached slowly, but dis-
tinctly, and she now attempted to rouse
Armida, and if possible excite her to
escape, or conceal themselves from those
who were passing the heath.
It was too late : two figures visibly ap-
proached, but there was nothing menac-
ing in their attitude: it was a man and

woman ; his arm was thrown soothingly
around her, and she leaned on him with
an air of softness and submission : they
advanced : the light of the moon fell
strongly on their figures. The man was
Condal, the woman Gabriella. They
were conversing in a low voice, but of
their conversation nothing could be
· heard but the tenderness of tone and ex-
pression in which it was murmured.
They passed near the spot, but Armida
and Rosine were in the shade; and as
they crossed the heath near this desolate
pair, they seemed like spirits going to
bliss, whose bright journey leads them
for an instant near the abode of final
1
woe.
The steady light discovered them but
too plainly to the wretched Armida :
under the impulse of despair she stretch-
ed out her arms to him; she tried to
call on his name in tones that would have
pierced his soul, but she had no voice ;
a deep sigb, like that preceding dissolu-

tion, burst from her heart, and she sunk
into the arms of Rosine.
"Was that a vision we saw ?" she
cried, after a long pause, raising her eyes
fearfully to Rosine.
" And am I here,”
she cried, “wandering like an outcast,
alone at night, hazarding reputation
and life for a man who leaves me to
perish.” She stretched her arm with
wiid emotion towards Connal.
“I would have kpelt at your feet, I
would have died at them," she cried ;
o but I shall save you the guilt of spurn-
ing me. May you never know the heart
you have rejected. Alas! you will
know too soon her whom you have pre-
ferred."
As they returned to the castle, a num-
ber of lights and a crowd of soldiers and
domestics at the gate announced the re-
turn of Wandesford.
Armida, now well acquainted with
the windings of the rocks, pursued
another direction, and in the tumult that

accompanied the arrival of Wandesford
they reached her apartment without dis-
covery.
She eagerly threw off her wet garments,
and Rosine saw with astonishment that
she even took some pains to arrange her
dress and her dishevelled hair: she dread-
ed some new convulsion of passion, and
followed her, unable to speak, to the
apartment were the family, even at this
late hour, had gathered round Wandes-
ford, to listen at last to authentic intelli-
gence,
At Armida's appearance he bowed
slightly and continued his conversation,
which was principally addressed to Lady
Montclare.
He described the force and astonish-
ing efforts of the rebels; spoke mode-
rately of his own conduct; but appear-
ed to think that the danger, though re.
mote, was by no means over.
The scenes in which he had been en.
gaged had excited his spirit, which was

natúrally daring, and the consciousness of
his own distivguished conduct gave a
degree of dignity to his manner, for
nothing exalts a man so much in the
pre-
sence of women as the knowledge that
his character for courage has preceded
bim.
Lady Montclare, who heard with
horror that the rebels had entrenched
themselves in the mountains, and that
the country would probably continue
disturbed for the remainder of the win-
ter, as their inaccessible situation com-
pletely defied "military force, now trem-
'blingly inquired if it were possible for
them to be safer in Galway, or any towa
where a military force was stationed,
during the winter.
“ It is my advice,” said Wandesford,
“ that your ladyship and the family
should immediately quit the castle, and
fix your residence in Galway or Lough-
rea, as in this remote castle you will be
exposed to the incursions of the rebels.

I will undertake for your safe conduct
to any place where you may fix your re-
sidence. I can still undertake for your
protection: once,” he added, “I had
hoped to urge a more tender claim, but
that I must now endeavour to forget."
Every one was silent; but Armida,
collecting all her strength to meet this
crisis of her fate, said faintly :-
“ Do you then wish to forget it?"
The baughty soul of Wandes ford
could not resist the triumph of this mo-
ment, and he answered:
“ At least I wish to forget the com-
petitor for whom I was dismissed,”
Oh! mention not his name,” said
Armida, with an impulse she could not
resist, « if
you
would have me listen to
you."
• I - will forget him 'as willingly as
you,” said Wandesford; “I will forget
every thing but the hopes those delicious
words revive. Armida, what am I to
understand from them?"

“If you are willing to understand
me," said Armida, in vain forcing her
features to assume a sickly and heart-
forbidden smile of encouragement,
" I
have said enough, and if you are not I
have said too much."
She held out her shrinking hand to
him, and Wandesford, seizing it, began
to pour forth the most rapturous ac-
knowledgments ; yet, even at this mo-
ment, the hand of the first of her sex
did not give him such pleasure as the
triumph of his proud and vindictive
heart announced
the man he !
hated.
“Oh, spare me,” cried Armida, break-
ing from him, "spare me; I cannot bear
this; I do not deserve it; it is not in my
nature to deceive: if you can accept of
an alienated heart it is your's ; your
generosity has already taught it grati-
tude, and time may teach it esteem, and
even give it peace.”

with Lady Montclare for the remainder
of the night.

For some days Wandesford supported
the character of an assiduous and happy
lover, bụt his pride could wear the mask
no longer. The artless complacency with
which Armida received his attentions irri-
tated bim the more, as it left no room for
complaint, and the consciousness of not
being loved is that sensation of all others
which makes us the most anxious to seek
for the evidence of what we fear.
Letters now arrived from England,
from his mother and his uncle, Sir Edgar

proudest baronet in England), intreating

lemnize his marriage at the old family
seat in England.
Lady Montclare eagerly pressed him
to comply with their advice, mentioning
that Endymion and she would fix their
residence in Galway for the winter, and
Rosine might accompany Armida to Eng-
Jand. Wandesford, whose regiment was
now off duty, and who was anxious to
convey Armida from Ireland as soon as
possible, embraced the proposal, and it
was settled that they should quit the cas-
tle the moment they could with safety.
Armida was present at their confer-
ence: sbe listened to every thing, assented
to every thing, and heard or understood
nothing. Her mind, fixed on the one
great effort of making the sacrifice that
approached with silent dignity, had no
room for its details; and if she had
wish at this moment, it was to be away
from Ireland, for every express brought
accounts of the heroism with which the

rebel leader kept his little band together,
in the centre of a bleak mountain, amid
winter, famine, and the foe; of the con-
duct with which he had hitherto repelled
the approach of disciplined troops; and
of the humanity with which, amid all his
hardships, he protected the peasantry
from the aggressions of his fierce and
mutinous forces.
Winter had approached with unusual
severity, and all its gloom seemed con-
centrated in the castle. --The inquietude
of Lady Montclare became daily more
obvious, and at length declaring that the
severity of the season must preclude all
danger on the part of the insurgents, sbe
announced her resolution of quitting the
castle the following week, and pressed
Wandesford to fix his departure on the
same day. Wandesford, who had pro-
tracted his stay only with the hope of
torturing Armida with Connal's fate, was
obliged to comply. Servants were dis-
patched to clear the roads, which were

almost impassable from the snow, and a
party of Wandesford's regiment was ap-
pointed to escort them.
But during this interval of prepara-
tion, like Satan, knowing his time was
short, his rage and malignity were in-
creased tenfold, and Armida's resolution
was hourly tried to the utmost.
On one of those melancholy days,
while Rosine and she were sitting toge-
ther enjoying the dreary consolation of
gilence, he broke into the room, and tak-
ing out a letter he had just received, be-
gan to read aloud an exaggerated account
of the sufferings of the rebels, with a
sanguinary denunciation against Connal,
containing a copy of the reward offered
for bis apprehension. Armida, on whom
he fixed his eyes with savage triumph,
grew pale, but did not utter a word; but
Rosine, whose spirit was roused by this
unmanly persecution, said indignantly,

“Yes," replied Wandesford, with a

brutal oath, " and a man that will not
be governed by a woman that defies
either their art to defeat, or their inso.
lence to disturb him.”
Rosine, not trusting herself with the
answer that rose to her lips, quitted the
room, and Armida was about to follow
her, till hearing the rude laugh with which
Wandesford was pursuing her retreat,
she calmly resumed her seat.
“ Is this your resolution ; is this the
self-command with which you flattered
yourself and me?” said Wandesford, strid-
ing up and down the room to work him-
self into a passion. “You cannot contain
your emotion at that ruffian's name: in.
stead of execrating him you are at this
moment ready to weep, and nothing but
your infernal pride restrains your tears.
What hope can I have of the confidence,
what security for the honour of a woman
thus debased by passion?”

have violated both. I could
not expect sensibility from you, but I have

trampled on it, and stabbed it.”

you have nothing but pride, caprice, and
desire. While the first men in Europe
were at your feet you spurned them. My
honourable addresses, the addresses of a
man of the first family, fortune, and cha-
racter were despised ; but the moment
you saw this Irishman, this heir of the
poverty, and pride, and infamy of his
country, jou rushed into his arms, though
he dashed you from them. Perhaps his
figure awoke your classical taste, and
you wished to transfer your study, like
the statuary of old, from marble to

Armida was indignantly retiring, but
he detained her by force.
" Mark me!
by Heaven, I am not lamenting the
discovery of your worthlessness !--no, I
rejoice in it; but I will make such use
of it as will effectually secure my ho-
nour, and your repentance, if not your
reformation.
I will watch your very
soul: I will sift your every word; I will
be an Argus on your conduct, and an
interpreter of your very eyes."
“ Hold, sic !” said Armida, with a
look that awed and silenced even him,
" and let me remind you of your only se-
curity, my own honour: at this moment it
enables me to despise your menaces, as at
every future one it will to defy them.”
He relinquished the arm he had rudely
seized, and walked sullenly away, ashamed
of the conviction it bad forced on him.
" But let me warn you, Colonel Wan-,
desford," she continued, leaning on her
seat to support her trembling frame,

• What !” said Wandesford, starting
at her last words, “ do you then intend to
retreat from your engagements ?”
Oh, no!” said Armida, smiling with
high disdain : “Oh, no, thou honourable
lover! I will fulfil the bond : my person
and fortune will be your's : you shall bear
about this wretched, faded figure, in all
the heartless pageantry of splendid mi-
sery ; but take care that even before
your
victim is bound she does not escape.
“ And who can take you from me
now?” said Wandesford, with a mixture
of rancour and fear.

did not quit till the night preceding that
fixed for their departure for England.
During the interval, Rosine frequently
entered her apartment, and always found
her employed in writing : she never spoke,
or even raised her head; and Rosine re-
tired silently as she entered.
But on that evening, after having
made her own brief preparation for the
journey, unable to bear the still and omi.
nous gloom of her apartment, and the
silence of the castle, only broken by the
half-heard step of a hurrying domestia,
she went at a late hour to Armida's apart-
ment: she found her in a travelling dress,
and prepared to sit up all night, as the
carriages were to be ready in a few
hours. A large packet lay, on the table
before her : she looked at it for some time,
and then said calmly,
« Take those pa-
pers, my dear Rosine : let them meet no
eye but your's. It is no superstition that
dictates to me this journey will be my

departure from life. Alas! I now feel
that nothing but my sufferings will sur-
vive me."
Rosine took the papers; but on her re-
turn to her apartment she found it im-
possible to retire to sleep. The castle
clock had struck two; at six their drea-
ry journey was to commence. The snow
that drifted against the casements obscur-
éd all view from them; and the hollow
sweeping of the wintry wind making her
thoughts every moment more gloomy,
she revived her dying fire, and sat down
ble. Yet often as the storm beat strong-
.
ly against the walls, and imagination
formed other sounds within her desolate
chamber, she dropped the papers, and
mentally exclaimed—“Is this the prepa-
tion for a bridal journey !".

images multiplied, the language coloured

« Love to man is like a flower that he
steps out of his path for a moment to
gather: he is pleased with it; he gazes
on its beauty; he inhales its fragrance,
and flings it away to wither. But wo-
man, like the Persian Peri, feeds on its
odorous essence, and feeds on it alone, or
dies.
Yes, I feel it; all that agitates or
embellishes life is over with me; nothing
disturbs, nothing touches, nothing awakes
me: like the ancient cities of Italy, the
burning tide of passion and despair has

My talents are gone, the impulse
that pride and flattery once gave them
was worn away by repetition.
Passion succeeded, and-oh! how
brilliant and eternal seems that light with
which genius irradiates the new world
of love. In his presence, I could have
been all that has been fancied of a muse

fugitive than the boasted powers of
mind : will the glow of her form be as
soon lost as that of my mind ? A younger
and fairer than me has won him, and
though every deserted woman may com-

strange, it seems to unfold a new page in
human suffering, though I have but

At this moment Rosine, who had often
paused to weep, heard the voice of
Wandesford, and in a few moments the
hurrying steps of servants announced
their approaching departure.
She concealed the papers, and hurried
to Arinida’s apartment, who, standing
silently amid her attendants, appeared to
witness the preparations as she would
those for her approaching death.
Lady Montclare now entered, and
after a cold embrace, and an unanswered
inquiry for the unfortunate Endymion,
who did not appear, they descended to
the hall: Wandesford was waiting with
loud impatience for them.
As Rosine crossed the immense gothic
hall, the darkness, the dim lights, and
the looks of the half-awakened servants,
faintly appearing in its wide extent,,
seemed to her to resemble a funeral pro-
cession to a vault.
Shuddering with cold and terror, she
placed herself in the carriage: the roads

On their arrival at Loughrea, Wan-
desford learned that Banagher was but
twenty miles further, and that when they
reached it they would be out of Con-
naught; and in spite of a tremendous
snow-storm, and the remonstrances of
the people at the inn, he determined to
press forward and reach it if possible
before evening. Armida and Rosine
made no resistance. The soldiers were
dismissed, as the part of the country
they had now to travel through was
perfectly tranquil, and after a slight
refreshment, they again set off about
two, menaced on every side by the state

of the elements and of the country. The
sun set: the country was one bleak
expanse of snow, intersected by tracts of
bog, to which the unfrozen water gave
a dusky hue; and the sky, livid and
lowering with the pallid gloom of
winter, seemed to denounce all its terrors
against the travellers. Armida, throwing
herself back in the carriage, and cover-
ing her face with her handkerchief, kept
a profound silence ; and Wandesford
appeared to be asleep. Rosine, left to
herself, involuntarily threw her eyes on
the dim prospect around her, and better
acquainted with the country than either
of her fellow-travellers, she soon dis-
со ered that it was not the road to
Leinster they were passing, as that
would long since have led them through
Killimer and Eyrecourt.
With difficulty she roused Wandes-
ford, and made bim comprehend that
the driver must have mistaken the road.

ping the carriage, demanded of the man
where he was : he at first persisted that
he was right, and that they were now
near Banagher, but after a short exami-
nation of the country, he confessed he
had lost the track; and blaming Wan-
desford for forcing him to pursue the
journey at such an hour', and in such
weather, refused to proceed further with-
out information. Rosine, during the
debate, examined the country still more
closely, and in spite of the darkpest,
discovered with horror that they were in
the very part of it which was infested by
rebels ; this discovery she did not com-
municate, but her silence only increased
her fears. The driver, urged by Wan-
desford's execrations, proceeded a few
yards further; but the horses then sud.
denly stopped, and he declared that their
restiveness proceeded from their intuitive
sense of some danger, which the dark,
ness of the night prevented him from
discovering. Wandesford, now compell-

ed to exert some degree of reflection,
ordered the carriage which followed
with Armida's female attendants to pre-
cede them cautiously, and in a few
minutes they learned the dreadful neces-
sity of the precaution. A horrible crash,
accompanied by the plunging of the drown-
ing horses, and the screams of the un-
fortunate women, compelled them to
stop.
Wandesford, unwilling to encounter
the ioclemency of the night, still urged
the driver on, and slowly the half-frozen
horses dragged on a few steps further,
and heavily the carriage followed through
the deep roads, sinking up to the nave of
the wheels at every step; till Armida and
Rosine, terrified at the fate of the unfor-
tunate women, and trembling for their
own, insisted on quitting the carriage,
and seeking some shelter even on foot.
They alighted, and called aloud on the
sufferers : no voice answered them: the
shrill wind bore their voices far away,

and the outriders, half-blinded by the
snow, and frozen almost to their saddles,
could give them no information: they
had seen the carriage suddenly disappear :
they had heard the cry of those within it,
but they knew no more.
The horror that sat on every counte-
nance was rendered more ghastly by the
light that played over the horizon. There
was no moon; but the quick and vivid
coruscations of the sky, revealing nothing
but snow and heath, seemed to appear
only to mock their terrors. During a
long interval of their disappearance,
Rosine discovered a light at a vast
distance, whose dim but steady ray was
soon distinguished by the rest of the
party; and thither they determined to
turn their course, and if possible to pro-
cure assistance for their unfortunate
attendants, and shelter for themselves.
The servants again mounting their
horses, proceeded cautiously; and Ar-
mida and Rosine followed in the car.

riage, till the inequalities of the road,
never intended for the passage of vehicles,
compelled them again to quit it, and some-
times supported by, but oftener shrink-
ing from the oaths and impatience of
Wandesford, they attempted to follow
the direction of the light.
With incredible difficulty they at
length reached a large desolate building,
which stood without office or improve-
ment near it, alone on the heath. - The
light disappeared as they approached it,
and their loud applications for admission
produced nothing but their own echo.
At length a voice from within inquired
their business : they demanded admission
and shelter for the night, and were told
there was no accommodation within ;
that it was a deserted house, inhabited
only by an occasional tenant, and in the
disturbed state of the country the inmates
were afraid to admit travellers at that
unseasonable hour. Wandesford, in a
fury, commanded the servants to break

open the door; and the people within,
apparently terrified' by his violence, after
a muttering consultation between them-
selves consented to admit them: the
light re-appeared, and the harsh and
grating bars of the door were slowly
withdrawn.
A man and woman stood at the door:
famine, want, and wickedness, were
painted in the most lurid colours on their
faces, and the miserable blue light they
held darkened the expression while it'
revealed it. The features of the man
were rendered wilder by a grim smile, as
he viewed the figure of Armida, and her
superb, though soiled dress.
The party hurried through the large
damp hall, and, uninvited, entered an
apartment, which; though little less
dreary, was illuminated by an immense
turf fire burping on the hearth. Their
grim hosts gave them no welcome; and
even while reviving their chilled limbs
at the fire, they stared round them with

terror at the damp, dripping walls, the
broken floor, the black ceiling, and the
vast, shapeless, creaking blocks that
seemed not to have been put to the use of
chairs, for half a century since they were
made. Some brown bread and whiskey
were on the table, of which, after a long
silence, they were sullenly invited to par-
take, and on their refusal, the people,
who seemed to think all claim on their
attention was over, lounged gloomily
against the window, surveying their
guests with looks of murky inquietude,
which they tenfold returned with looks of
dismay.
Rosine, as one of the jarring doors
moved behind her with every blast that
ho wled round the house, caught a view:
of a number of arms deposited in the next
room : she had resolution enough to con-.
ceal a discovery that she felt could do no
good, but she felt her terror intolerable
from that mouent.
After a sullen pause, the man turned

to the window as if to examine the wea-
ther, and then with his back turned to
them, said: “ There will be a moon in less
than an hour, and you had better pursue
your journey."
“ We don't know where to go," said
Wandesford as sullenly," and considering
the little accommodation we trouble you
for, you can afford to spare it somewhat
longer.”
“ If you do not like it,” said the
man, " the sooner you quit it the
better."
The woman gave him a look, as much
as to say, we had better keep them as
long as we can; but he repelled her by
an angry motion, and Rosine, astonished
at a degree of inhospitality from which
the poorest Irish cottager would have
revolted, could not reconcile it with the
apparent poverty of the people, and the
liberal compensation they migbt expect
from the appearance and equipage of the
travellers.

The servants, who had found a shed for
the carriage and horses, now returned to
request a light and some assistance to
discover the rest of the party, and the man
went muttering with them.
The woman remained : the same dead
leaned exhausted on the shoulder of Ro-
sine, and Wandesford strode up and
down the room, grumbling curses between
his closed teeth.
Heavy steps were now heard approach-
ing the room, and two men suddenly
entered it, who starting at the sight of
the strangers, retired to the other end of
the room: the woman spoke to them in
Irish, but they did not seem to hced her,
and conversed together in whispers.. As.
Wandesford crossed the room, his eye
suddenly caught theirs: he started, and
stilling an exclamation that seemed to
partake of hatred and terror, he threw
himself in his chair, and spread his hand-

kerchief over his face. One of the men
then rose, and placed himself opposite
Wandesford, as if determined to meet his
look; and Wandesford, who felt from his
steps he was near him, seemed forced by
some invisible power to raise himself and
meet his eye. The man grinned and
nodded at him with horrid significance,
and Rosine, roused by this extraordinary
scene, observed with terror their coun-
tenances thus fixed on each other, glaring
with the paleness of malignity and fear.
Unable any longer to bear her fears alone,
she touched Armida, who raised her head,
and they interchanged looks of alarm,
but they had no time for conjectural
terror, for the other man rising, they
both seized Wandesford, and with loud
curses, they attempted to drag him from
the room.
Wandesford struggled with his utmost
strength, uttering the most dreadful cries
for assistance, vainly echoed by Armida

and Rosine, who, screaming and mad
with horror, expected to see him mur-
dered before their eyes.
His strength encreased by despair, he
resisted them at first, till the female fury
held the lighted candle to his hands, with
which he had grasped the table. He was
then torn away : the woman followed,
and Armida and Rosine, who had sunk on
the floor together, were left alone.
Gasping, almost senseless, and clinging
to each other for the support which nei-
ther could give, they did not dare to raise
their heads, to speak, or even to breathe
for some minutes, A loud noise at the
door roused them, and they recognised
the voice of one of the servants demand-
ing admittance,
- The door is locked,” said Rosine;
“I heard them fasten it as they went
out.”
“ Try to escape by the window, my
lady," said the man, in a voice of

terror: "I cannot assist you, and there is
no good meant you here."
The terrified women examined the
windows, but they found them all secured
beyond their strength, and the man felt
from their silence the trial was in vain.
« Ah !” cried Armida, sinking again
on the ground, “ Connal is not here to
save us.”
" Where is Colonel Wandesford ?"
said Rosine, almost afraid to listen to the
answer.
" I saw them drag him from the house,
my lady,” said the man : " they said they
would not do his business here."
« Gracious heaven!” cried Armida,
“ then they will murder him."
- Oh! Edward, if these people are
banditti, tell them I have articles of value,
tell them I have jewels in my possession:
I will give them every thing; I will make
them rich for life, if they will let us es-
cape without insult and danger."

"Ah! my lady, they took care to find
that out themselves," said the man,
they are now busy plundering the car-
riage ; but they said all their business
was with Colonel Wandesford, and per-
haps you have nothing to fear.”
Perhaps !” repeated Rosine, " oh!
we have every thing to fear from such
wretches: try, my good fellow, to make
your escape from this dreadful place;
I know we are not many miles from the
castle; try to reach it, and send us assist-
ance, before we die of terror here."
The man was going to reply, but he
was repelled by the approach of some one,
and in a few uinutes the woman again
entered the room. Hard as she was, she
seemed touched by the sight of the deso-
Jate females, and she attempted to give
them some comfort, but her words were
contradicted by her voice and looks, that
seemed only calculated to inspire disgust
and dismay.
She pressed the spirits on Armida,

and when they were rejected with horror,
said calmly, “ Poor thing, he was your
sweetheart I suppose : well, don't fret, he
is in good hands.”
“Oh! tell us only,” said Rosine in
earnest agóny,

or what is it we have to expect; "and
Armida, forgetting all her hatred for
Wandesford, in the horrible contempla-

for his life as if her own depended on its
preservation; but' neither inquiry nor
supplication could extort more than cold
and coarse assurances that they were in
safety and in good hands, that they had
nothing to fear, and with a good fire and

it' was their own folly if they fretted for
any thing : she then left them, adding she
would tell them more to-morrow; and
wearied with terror and with conjectures
on this mysterious adventure, they at
length sunk into mute despair, and with
eyes fixed on the dim windows waited

for day, in the prospect of which even the
most hopeless feel a kind of indefinite se-
curity
As the men dragged Wandesford from
the house, they expressed no intention of
immediate violence, but finding he still
continued his struggles, they secured his
arms with strong ropes, and placing him
on a horse between them, they set off at
full gallop.
The dreadful state of the weather and
the country, and the weakness of their
miserable horses, often threatened their
lives during their perilous journey, which
was pursued at full speed ; and Wandes-
ford, stupified by his struggles,'his ter-
rors, and his speed, resigned himself with-
out speaking to his conductors.
At length they arrived at a river, and
here Wandesford believed their progress
must be checked, but the men seizing his
reins, plunged in : their horses swam or
rather floundered through the broken ice,

and drenched and chilled, and almost
lifeless, they reached the opposite bank.
There was a dim and clouded moon, such
as shews itself through the thick vapours
of a snowy night, and Wandesford disco-
vered on an eminence the ruins of an edi.
fice that had once been sacred : the nu-
merous narrow spires, the crosses on every
pinnacle, and the vast eastern window,
were faintly touched by that cold and
shadowy light that seems to announce the
habitations of the dead.
All round was bare, bleak, and deso-
late; but as they then approached, some-
thing like a watch-word was given, and
echoed from the walls, and some figures
were seen moving, and apparently armed,
in the shadow of the building, and their
forms, covered with snow from head to
foot, strangely contrasted the dark and
massive walls, and the deep silence that
pervaded them.
Wandesford was led forward, and the

men left him in a room, which, when he
examined, had some appearance of mo-
dern comfort. There were seats and a
fire, and from its look it seemed to have
been once the cell of the abbot.
He was roused by voices in the next
room, into which the men had passed, and
he heard them relating with wild exulta-
tion the prize they had seized.
He knew too well the cause of their
hatred, and he shook with uncontrollable
fear.
" “What, is Wandesford in your hands !"
said a voice whose tones froze his blood :
how, where, by what means ?"
The men related that tbey had found
him in a house of theirs, about two miles
off, where they believed he had been by
accident for shelter, and that he was tra-
velling with his wife and another fe-
male.
" Leave me, leave me for a moment,”
said Connal in an agony of emotion : "I
cannot speak to you now; but,” calling af:

ter them, "touch him not at the peril of
your lives : leave him to me alone.”
Wandesford was now fully awake to his
situation; and he collected the small re-
mains of his mental dignity to meet it. He
believed his death certain ; and be felt, as
most men destitute of religion and princi-
ple feel in their last hour, a sense of
pride, a false but imposing substitute for
both.
In a few moments a number of men
entered the room, and silently ranging
themselves round it, leaned on their arms
with their eyes fixed on the ground.
Connal entered last, and stood amid his
desperate band like the great angelic
chief among the fallen host of inferior
spirits, awed by his strength, dazzled by
his brightness, and lost by his example.
Wandesford, rising, proudly stood op-
posite to him with his arms folded; but
he could not lift up his eyes to that figure
which still stood proudly eminent above
that of all the sons of men,

voice which swelled to thunder as he
spoke, “ let this hour convince you how

owned their delusion : they flung those
arms from their hands: they threw thema
selves on the mercy of government, and
on your honour.
“ Traitor! unworthy of the name of

and death in their view, there is not one of
them who cannot, laying his hand on his
condemned breast, thank heaven he is not
such as you.

Wandesford, stunned and overwhelmed,
scarce heard his last words; but the men
did, and they murmured loudly, and struck
their arms with that wild and inarticu-

than supplies the wantof language among
a ferocious and mutinous soldiery,
Connal rushed forward.
.." Let none of you lay a finger on him.
Who is your leader ? Not a hair of his
head shall fall to the ground !---He is
her husband,” He leaned trembling with
agony against the wall. “I will cleave to
the middle the first of you that touches
him!-he is her husband !”
Wandesford saw his agony: he saw
the thick drops stand on his quivering
forehead: he saw him in vain drag his
luxuriant hair over his cheek to hide his
distracted features : he feasted on the
sight; and neither honour nor gratitude
could impel him to the discovery which
at that moment he would have even sacri-
ficed his life to conceal.
The murmurs of the party subsided,
and they were leading Wandesford away,
when Connal, who had recovered him-
self, exclaimed-

« Let him remain here to-night : let
him have the best accommodation the cir-
cumstances he has reduced usto will allow.
" Colonel Wandesford,” he added
more sternly, we trust you no more :
you must be conducted blindfold from
this ruin to-morrow.
“ If we meet you in the field, y u will
then be at my unshackled mercy : but tell
your friends who arm against us that they
fight against men, who will gnaw the
roots of the earth for sustenance, who will
bear this bleak season on their naked bo-
dies, before they will sell those bodies at
less than a life for every limb, or yield
them to your gibbets while a soldier's hand
remains to give them a soldier's death."
The next morning Wandesford was
conducted in safety from the ruined ab-
bey; and forgetting even Armida in his
determinations of instant and dreadful
vengeance, he set off with the utmost
speed for the town where his regiment
was quartered.

Armida and Rosive passed the night in
speechless solitude.
The morning broke, and though they

they feared it would only discover new
dangers.
About noon the woman entered ; but
her manner was now totally changed :
she behaved with the utmost servility,
and entreated them to take some refresh-

as if they were at perfect liberty.

had been rendered as comfortable as any
room in that dreary mansion could, and
exhausted by fatigue, willingly partook
of the refreshments which were heaped
on the table; but neither inquiry nor sup-

visible, no vestige of human habitation
discernible; and they sat shuddering
over their fire during the whole of that
dreary day.
Night came on. Rosine, whose terfors
were increased by her stronger sense of
danger, walked restlessly up and down
the room; but Armida, oppressed more
by the burden of her heart than her situ.
ation, sat passively.
Starting, she called on Rosine to listen
to the sound of a harp.
“ What harp ?" said Rosine ; " I hear
no harp."
“ But I do," said Armida-" I hear
the harp of the old bard. Is it an omen of
fancy, or a real sound?”
They listened, and then heard it
faintly but distinctly in a remote part of
the building
Both eagerly attempted to open the
door, but it was secured : they called on
the woman, but no one answered ; and-

herself to that delicious but mournful
sepsation which music excites when it
revives the scenes in which we first heard
it. Her heart was with Connal on the
lone heath again-again she offered him
the sacrifice of life, luxury, and fame,
but the tear that wandered down her pale
cheek was dried by the recollection for
whom that sacrifice had been rejected.
At that moment the woman hastily
entering, exclaimed-
" The captain is coming."
She retired before any inquiry could
be made or answered, and Armida and
Rosine hurried to the window with min-
gled curiosity and terror.
A severe frost had succeeded the snow
of the preceding day: the surface of the
ground was hard, dry, and glittering.
They heard from a great distance the
tramp of horses: the moon was bright,
the troop approached, and several per
sons with lights appearing at the door to
receive them, they distinguished a horse-

man of superior figure alighting first,
to whom all the rest appeared to pay a
kind of rude deference, but he was in a
military uniform of green, and all their
fears were re-increased, as they beheld
his wild, martial figure, his commanding
gestures, and the mute and savage sub-
mission which the party appeared to pay
him.
The loud noise of their entrance echo-
ing through the spacious building drown-
ed every other sound, and Armida and
Rosine had no heart to mention their ter-
rors to each other ; but before they could
speak, the woman rushed in to announce
the captain was approaching, and a light
and rapid step followed her. They rose
at his entrance. There were no lights in
the room, and the dim fire did not revcal
nis figure; but they could distinguish
his taking off his cap as he entered, and
advancing with graceful dignity.

your fears: dread nothing from us: we
are unhappy men, whose feelings are at
war with our situation; but desperate as
it is, it cannot compel us to oppress those
whom man is bound to protect and
lionour."
He was interrupted by a groan from
Armida, who in the first sound of his
voice had recognized the voice of Connal,
and vaidly attempting to suppress her
emotion, sunk from her seat on the
ground. Connal rushed forward to as-
sist her: lights had been brought in, and
he discovered that the female he was sup-
porting was Armida.
The burst of agony with which he
called on her name, the impassioned clasp
with which he held her lifeless form one
moment to his heart, the despair with
wbich he relinquished her while he still
continued to bend over her, amazed Ro-
sine, and she said mentally-

repentance or compassion ?"

“ Rosine,” said Connal, recollecting
himself, "are you here too? Forgive
me, I did not see you: my eyes are still
dim, and aching with the snow.” And
as he turned away, his luxuriant hair in
yain concealed the tear he wiped away-
- I will not insult her by my presence,"
said he, mournfully retiring : “ tell her
I am gone to give orders for her safe
conduct. While she remains, she shall
be unseen by me, and when she departs,
the blessing that follows her steps shall
be heard by heaven alone."
Armida recovered slowly. she looked
round, and saw he was gone
Why did he go?" said she, faintly:
is does Gabriella forbid him the exercises
of common humanity? Alas! if he could
bear the reproaches of this wasted figure,
he had no other to fear."
Rosine, attempting to console ber,
mentioned the assurances of safety and
liberation she had received from bim.

does the beart feel between those cold
and measured duties that the man of ho-
nour pays the helpless female, and that
burning tribute that gift of the free-
grace of love, that like that of angels
seems intuitive and involuntary."
An approaching step was heard, and
Connal again entered. Armida hastily
drew down her veil, as he approached
with faltering steps.
“ Forgive this second interruption,”
said he, in still more faltering accents :
“ I had forgot what I meant to say:
Colonel Wandesford is safe, and at li-
berty. Your attendants too are here,
and to-morrow sball accompany you
wherever you wish to go. I need not
add," he continued, while his dark cheek
was tinged with crimson, " that even in
this den of rapine all that belongs to you
has been as sacred as in a sanctuary. My

you within a mile of the castle, or where
you wish, at the risk of their lives."
" And is Wandesford safe?” cried
Rosine, to whom the frightful image of:
his murder was still present; and even
Armida uttered an expression of pleasure,
for she felt that she was not deserted
while Wandesford lived, and this gave
her a degree of confidence that her for-
lorn situation seemed to demand.
The awful frown that was sometimes
seen on Connal's brow gathered as he
looked at her; his voice suddenly became
firm, and he said :
The honour due to the sex and rank
of the wife of a general officer shall be
paid strictly by the man who avows him-
self his mortal enemy, and who will never
forget it, except when he has him in his
power.”
“ His wife! did he say his wife !"
cried Armida, starting from her seat as
he proudly retired ; " but what matters

dignity, or what matters it to the lover of
Gabriella whether I am the wife of Wan-
desford or not?".
The woman now returned, and from
the increased servility of her manner they
easily comprehended that they were in-
debted to Connal for the change it had
undergone.
Profuse and even elegant refreshments
were spread before a cheerful fire, but
Armida could not partake of them ; and
Rosine, who shuddered to think the pur-
chase of them might have been some
brave man's life, declined them too. The
woman retired, after inquiring at what
hour they wished to depart in the morat-
ing Armida, after some ineffectual at-
tempts to speak, motioned to Rosine to
answer, and she, who felt from this ap-
peal they could not quit this spot too
soon, naming an early hour, the woman
retired.

nounced the haunt of banditti; yet Ar-
mida and Rosine felt terror' eyen in this
strange calm, till weariness overpowering
every other sensation, they threw them-
selves in their clothes on the humble bed,
as the boarse clock below striking one,
was answered by the jarring sounds of
bolts and locks strongly secured, and the
solitary step of some individual, who
appeared to be stationed as a sentinel in

ARMIDA could not sleep: a feverish
doze was every moment broken by a
dream of terror; and once she was so
strongly impressed with the idea of some
one being in the room, that she sprung
from the bed, and seating herself beside
the fire, tried to banish the phantoms that

still seemed gathering in the darker re-
cesses of the room.
These visions soon faded away, but
she could not dismiss the idea that some
one was near the room, for from time to
time a distinct and measured foot-fall,
seemed to cross the passage which led
to the apartment. This circumstance,
though little surprising in a house in-
habited by armed men, surrounded
by danger, yet aggravated by night,
fear, and solitude, wrought upon her
feeliogs so powerfully, that at length
forcing herself to the door, she threw it
open, and cast a terrified glance be-

A figure stood at the extremity of the
passage, which retired at her approach.
Her dim eyes did not at first discover
Connal, but when she did, shrinking
back, she faintly exclaimed, " Ah ! why
are you here?”
" I dreaded,” said Connal, turning
from her, “I dreaded that in this wild

and I have watched here that neither
sound or step might approach your
room.”
“ I have no fears,” said Armida; ' you
may retire, if that was your purpose.”
"Oh, no! it was not: it was for a last
look-a last sound-a last thought of
you. I stood here that I might say to
my heart, I have been near her for the
last time, I wish that I could wither
on this spot, thinking my last thought of
you. And sure the happy Wandesford
would not deny me this : Oh, no! If he
could witness this bitter moment, he
would triumph; triumph not less that
you were his, than that you are lost to
me."
I am not the wife of Wandesford,"
said Armida, collecting all her strength
to utter these words;" but I forget
I am speaking to the lover of Gabri-
ella."

and grasping her hand, wbich in spite of
her struggles he pressed to his lips and
bosom ; but the next moment he released
it, and bowing his burning forehead al-
most to the ground, he exclaimed, but
to-morrow you will be bis : you are
going to meet him, and I must conduct
you.'
Where, where is Gabriella,” said Ar-
mida, indignantly repelling him," where
is she, to witness this scene ?".
“ Gabriella !" repeated Connal, in
amazement;" go to her, go to her ; like
me she may be deceived; but she will
not like me be broken-hearted. She was
not deceived. What delusion is this : she
is in safety, restored to her home, under
the protection of her family.'
“ Did you forsake her so soon then,”
said Armida, with indignant anguish,
so young, so beautiful, so devoted.
Alas! what had I to expect.”
Connal's burning cheek was visible

said, with a generous blush, “ to expose
the weakness of a woman : her passion,
her infatuation, call it what you will, led
her to follow me. I restored her uncom-
pelled; I led her home; I. left her un-
der her own roof, with a heart touched
by gratitude, but incapable of love.”
Armida stood for some moments silent
and stunned ; at last desperately break-
ing from him, " Why was I told this !”'
she cried, " I was less wretched when
I believed
you
false,”
- Believed me false ! Alas! was it
necessary to believe be false to make
you renounce me? I thought you had
only confirmed the sentence of the world;
that you had deserted one who was
already deserted by all mankind. I
thought you had awoke from the blessed
dream we once dreamed together, and
given your hand to the object who offer-
ed
you
the luxuries of life and fortune."

" then I

and lawless spot, to the deserts of Ame-
rica: what do I say! I was following
you through darkness and danger ; in the
hour of terror and infamy I was follow-
ing you, alone, and at midnight, without
guide and without hope. But I heard
you had another companion : I met you
with her on the heath, and, in despair,
I
gave myself to Wandes ford.”
“And yet you loved me, Armida?"
cried Condal, graspiog her hands, and
fixing on her his eyes, that burned with
love and despair.
“ Alas! had I not loved you more than
life, I had never given myself to Wan-
des ford: it was only when I ceased to
yalue life that I consented to become
his."
“ Yet still you loved me, Armida ?”
repeated Connal. Armida reclined her
drooping bead on his shoulder.

Locked in his arms, Armida wished
for death : « Let us part, and die," she
said, and broke from his arms; destiny
has forbid us happiness, and life does
not at least deny us dignity, let us part
like those who have deseryed a better
fate."
• And must those who loved as we

gleam on my dark fate, that I may re-

gathered round me; that I may say to
myself, when I lie on the earth, that must
be my bed and grave--I touched her
hand, and feel it still: I heard her voice,
and its sound is with me now."
Blinded with her tears, Armida tried
to reach the door, and faintly repelling
him with her hand, she said, “ I need no
partivg struggle---oo last agony to finish
the breaking of my heart;" and as
she spoke, believing her dying bour
not distant, and not wishing him to wit-
ness its horrors, she closed the door, and
sunk on the ground.
Terrified as well as wounded by this
movement, Connal supplicated, he de-
manded, he even attempted to force ad-
mittance. Armida heard his impetuous
intreaties: she heard bim plead with that
energy of passion, whose fierceness and

sound which strikes like a knell on the
heart that has loved.

Armida, as long as słe heard his re-
tiring steps, stood ; and when they ceas,
ed, she tottered to a seat, and remained
there frozen and senseless, her hands
locked in each other, her eyes fixed,
though unconsciously, on the spot where
she had
go, till an indistinct
noise forced her to perception, though
not to recollection of either place or per•
son-it was the servant and Rosine, who
were preparing for their departure: she
looked on them, but without distinguish-
ing any thing. They placed her in the
carriage, and it proceeded rapidly, but
she did not utter a word, or even ima-
gine where they were conveying her.
The rapid motion, the tumult of the
servants, and the chill air, restored her
to recollection : she gazed round her,
but the sight of her own servants accom-
panying the carriage at once made her
feel she was returning to the castle, and
shuddering, she relapsed again into si-
lence.

The carriage was attended by a band
of Connal's troops, but from the state of
the country they were unable to take the
direct road; and though the castle was
not twenty miles distant, the winding
route they pursued, and the state of the
roads, rendered it impossible for them to
reach it that evening. Their journey
often led them over precipices, where
the spirited horses could hardly be held
with a man at the head of each. The
inclemency of the weather increased, and
the heavy snow-showers, at times, hid
from them the dangers they encountered,
and at times shut them out from the view
of all assistance. At length, as they as-'
cended a steep hill, from which the wind,
raging with unresisting fury, 'swept the
snow as fast as it fell, the terrified
and panting horses fell back; and the
driver, half blind with the storm, and ig-
norant of the road, losing all command
of them, the carriage rolled backward to
the very edge. Rosine shrieked with ters

ror, but Armida did not utter a word.
“On such a spot,” she thought," he
once saved my life : but is it worth pre-
serving now !" The troop gallopped
forward; but Connal, though he had
kept in the rear all day, was now the
foremost, and while the rest only terri-
fied the horses by the tumult they made,
he checked the progress of their danger,
by applying his shoulder to the wheel;
nor did he quit it, though lacerated to
the bone, till the animals became steady.
He then hurried round, and throwing
open the door of the carriage, implored
them to alight while the horses were
led down the hill, whose precipitantness
defied the skill of the driver. Rosine ea-
gerly quitted the carriage; but Armida,
trembling at his sight, though undismay-
ed by her danger, averted her head, and
remained in her seat. Connal, forgetting
all constraint, supplicated her in agony
to quit it: she continued inflexibly si-
lent, and to Rosine's serious intreaties

she faintly answered,
“I feel no danger
while I remain bere.” Connal then car.
ried Rosine in his arms down the hill,
while his men, almost at the hazard of
their lives, led the carriage down the
precipice. Then, when he was at a disa
tance, Arinida leaned forward for a mo-
ment, and her imagination, always ex-
alted by his presence, felt a kind of me-
lancholy pleasure even in her present
danger.

courage, and that hardihood that seems
peculiar to the natives of a gloomy cli-

Connal struggling with the storm, half
lost in it, yet seeming almost to command
it; his mantle floating on the blast, the
plumes of his military helmet rent, and
scattering on it like colours in a battle.
But when she saw, as her danger en-
creased, his firm step faltering on the
cliff, his look so often thrown back,
his loud and eager charges to the men,

on the hill, yet retaining all the feeling
that inspired them; and at length his
resigning Rosine the moment she was
safe, and flying to her side, while his
wounded arm tracked every step on the
snow with blood, she lost all self-com-
mand; and as he approached, and she
saw his lacerated arm, which he had not
even bound, for the first time she scream-
ed aloud with terror. Connal, who
believed that this emotion of fear was
caused by his presence, not his wound,
which he had hardly felt, gave her a
look of despair, and throwing himself on
his horse disappeared in a moment.
But his parting look, his partibg
figure, as he proudly raised bis head, and,
drawing up the reins, urged his noble
horse, to its full speed, though on the
edge of a precipice, as if he meant to
bound into the air, and contend in his
passion with the angry elements, revived
past recollections in Armida’s heart, and

she attempted to tell him the real cause
of her terror; but her voice could no
longer reach him-he was gone.
What avails it?" said she, borrowing
false resolution from his absence. “ If
we must part, let there be no more of
these struggles, that take away all dig-
nity from my heart, without diminishing
its despair."
Rosine then re-entered the carriage,
and under her impressions of recent
danger, she could not help asking Armi-
da how she could venture down that
dreadful descent in a carriage.
- What had I to risk?” said Armida,
desperately,; " what have I to fear on
earth but one object? Do you know that
the sensation of his being near me, the
bare imagination that I may see him
again, almost deprives me of reason ?

strength he has left me: let me not be

feverenced the kind of frantic dignity
with which they were uttered, and she
wept in silence.
At the close of the day the storm sub-
sided; and the sun, breaking for a mo-
ment through the heavy snow-clouds,
shed its full glory on the ruined abbey,
which appeared on the summit of a hill
they were approaching. The flakes of
snow, falling thinner and thinner, appear-
ed to kindle in the rays that shone
through them; and the great east win-
dow, in a blaze with the setting light,
seemed the portal to a fairy palace of
fire. But all was dark before they
arrived ; and they were lifted out of the
carriage, chilled, and half dead with
fatigue and cold.
As the servants supported them
through the great aisle, a mortal cold-
ness seized on the heart of Armida; and
the terrified looks of her servants, who
believed they had been brought to this
dreary place for the most fatal purpose,

and who, as they tottered along, expect-
ed death froin behind every massive pil-
lar, deprived them even of the power of
asking the extent of their terrors.
The dark gothic chamber into which
they were conducted, its stillness, its
solitude, and the dim blue lights that
scarcely burned in it, made them appear
to each other like spirits meeting in a
vault. There were but two habitable
rooms in this ancient structure; one was
prepared for Armida and Rosine, the
other was given up to their attendants.
Connal and his band passed the night
under the cloister, exposed to the incle-
mency of the elements, to defend the re-
pose of those who suspected them of
murder. Connal, determined they should
not even have an opportunity of commu-
nicating disaffection to Armida's servants,
kept them without any other shelter than
the cloister the whole night, and that
they might have no room for murmur-
ing, he had no other himself.

As long as Armida had a sensation
that he was near, she was not without a
hope (which she dared not confess to
herself) that some remote contingency,
something improbable, or even preter-
natural, might prevent their final separa-
tion; and this hope, which we find such
difficulty in avowing, or even analyzing
to ourselves, is yet that of all others
which we find it the most difficult to re-
usign. Since her refusal to quit the
carriage, Connal had not approached
her, nor had he once appeared since her
arrival. All was still as the moments that
precede death. She felt that the last
hour was arrived, and the strength that
feebly and fitfully had supported her till
then now utterly failed: she sunk on the
ground, and repeatedly exclaiming--" It
is the last! it is the last hour !” seemed
insensible of every thing but the image
these words conveyed.
Rosine in vain exhausted every topic
of fortitude or consolation; with hope

all fortitude had fled, and she listened
like one who had no longer any excuse
før not yielding to despair.
They had not been long together, when
one of their servants entering, mentioned
that they were to leave the abbey in the
morning, and that he had been furnished
with a protection by the captain, in the
event of their meetiog with any of the
rebels, which was scarcely probable at
so sbort a distance from the castle. The
man could not contain his joy at the idea
of being in safety once more ; but he
mixed it with loud eulogiums on the
mild and generous treatment they had
received from O'Morven. -
It is well,” said Rosine, who felt the
sufferings of Armida at these words.
“ It is well : leave us : we shall be ready
in the morning."
The man then went away, after con-
gratulating his lady on the prospect of
being soon at Montclare Castle in safety,

and in the company of Wandesford. Ar-
mida faintly bowed her head; but from
the moment of this ill-timed visit her
agitation terribly encreased.
She attempted to listen to the words of
comfort uttered by Rosine, but she could
not understand them. She tried to col-
lect her ideas, bui the effort made their
derangement only plainer to herself: she
endeavoured to converse, but she could
not utter a coherent sentence. At length,
snatching up a pencil, she began writing
with rapidity; but her trembling hands,
and her fixed and burning eyes, seemed
to announce her almost unconscious of

a dreadful existence, without motion,

twenty-three years old : how much of
the desert of life yet remains to be trod,
and alone.
Rosine, firm and tender friend, you

ter what is at the bottom of my heart,
but what I can never express, the bitter-
ness of that moment would be such that
I must be shortly out of pain.
My despair does at last drive me to
think of death: alas! is it come to this..
I was called young, beautiful, and emi-
nent; and must I end my course by self-
murder ? Connal! Connal! you who
have made me what I am, take the
wretched forfeit of the life which you
have stripped even of hope: is it not
better that I should die by your hands
than my own!”
She attempted to add some words to
these, but her eyes seemed to burn in
their sockets like coals of fire; and the
characters on the paper seemed illu-
minated with burning sulphur. She closed
her eyes, and pressed her forehead tightly
with both her hands, but still she saw
the walls of the room, the hills she had
crossed that day, and the wild counte-

her in floods of fire.
Where is the snow ?” said she in
delirium. " There was snow there when
I saw them last: bring it again, to
quench these flames."
When she uttered these words, recol-
lecting herself, and shocked at the de-
rangement they betrayed, she tried to
rise, and reach the casement for air.
Rosine with difficulty supported her to
it, and threw it open. It was midnight :
a bright full moon shed a solemn glory
on the night. Heaven, burning with
ten thousand stars, seemed the dark con-
cave of a mine of diamonds : every thing
grand, motionless, and lovely, seemed to
contrast that fever of despair that was
consuming the wretched Armida. She
turned her eyes to the earth to find some-
thing congenial to misery there. Below
the casement there was a large enclosure:
it was the cemetry of the abbey. They
could distinguish the dark tomb-stones

the graves of the order, and the leafless
branches under whose shade the owners
had mused on the view of their final ha.
bitation.
The sight struck Armida to the heart,
Every thing,” said she, “ speaks the
same lesson to me. This is no casual
omen. Nature and passion alike an-
nounce 'my death. These all died in
peace," said she, solemnly waving her
arms over the dead : “ they had suffer-
ings, for they were mortal; but they re-
posed them and their hopes in the bosom
that never rejected one, or betrayed the
other-the bosom of Deity. Oh, how
different is the fate of the votaries of
this world and of the next! How
wretched did they appear in the eyes of
men : their food coarse, their bed the
ground, their employment prayer. Who
would outwardly have compared their
lot with snine ? Yet their life was peace-
ful, and their end blessed. Jlived oply

world has left me to die of a broken
heart.”
Awful as these reflections were, they
seemed to calm her : she was no longer
convulsed : she no longer trembled : she
leaned on Rosine, silent and absorbed.
Starting at a sound near them, they
turned and saw Connal. He was tra-
versing the room unconscious there was
any one there.
Armida shrunk at his
sight; and Rosine, terrified at its conse-
quences, said, " Why are you here?”
"I knew not where I was,” said Con-
nal, starting as from a trance.
" Since
I saw her for the last time, I know not
where I am, or what I do : I wander
about like a condemned spirit-I be-
lieved, I thought something pressed on
my mind about your departure, but it
is gone, and I cannot recall it."
Rosine, now unable to speak, implored
him by signs to leave the room. He

we will enjoy it, even to madness enjoy:

speak it, and let us die together."
“ We will not die together !” said
Connal, mournfully. He bore her in
his arms to the casement, and pointed to
the distant hills : « There is the
grave
of
your love, he will not die a felon's death:
on those lone hills will be my grave:
one brave man will stand by me-one
brave man will survive me long enough
to dig with his sword the earth that is
to cover me, perhaps to moisten it with
a tear, before he falls beside me : but
you, you will live in luxury and fame:
yet spare one tear to him whose dying
thought will be on you,

Oh, God!” cried the wretched Ar-
mida, “ that even Gabriella was with
you! Alas! you will want a woman's
breast to lean on, a woman's heart to
feel for you at that hour."

below. The old bard, who had accom-
panied O'Morven, and who remembered -
that the remains of some of the family
were deposited in the burial-ground, had
wandered out to feel for the graves where
they lay. Armida saw him totter over
the ground : she saw him sink on a
grave; and she heard again those omi-
nous chords he struck the night she met
him on the heath. How different from
the brilliant tones which awoke her ear-
ly sensibility, and inspired her youthful
talent !
“ Ah !” said she, shrinking at the
sound,“ my former friends are all turned
against me. Music, that I once culti-
vated ; music, that I once was said to
embellish; music is now become the
summoner of death to me!” As she
spoke, her cold hands lost their hold of
Connal, and her eyes became fixed. The
distracted Connal, kneeling before her,
implored for a word, a look of life.

“ God! this is too much for man.

war, and want, and danger ?”

A DREADFUL calm succeeded this
storm of passion, Armida, exhausted by
emotion, did not quit her couch: her ser-
yants were dismissed. Connal's band re-
tired, and he himself, absent all day,
only appeared in the evening, in a state
that shewed he almost hazarded life to
behold her for a moment, and to depart.
Rosine, unable to desert Armida iîn
this moment of desolation, passed her
sad time in traversing the cloisters of the
abbey, or listening to the blast that swept
through them at night.
On the tenth evening, as she sat re-
volving the danger of their retreat, being

discovered by I.ady Montclare, and scarce
knowing whether to wish or to fear it,
she beheld the man who had beep left in
the abbey, as an attendant, under the
casement: he beckoned to her, and she
leaned forward. “There is no light on the
Galway hills,” said he, "nor no light from
the old tower on the lough; nor all along
the bog, I see no light; and you must
set off to-night.”
" What do you mean?" said Rosine,
and where are we to go ?”
“ The captain told me,” said the man,
" that if his party were near, they would
light fires on the hills; but if not, there
was no safety for you; and you must go
with all speed to the camp, for the
king's troops would come and take you
else."
Rosine, though terrified at the thought
of seeking shelter in a rebel camp,
could
not yet forsake Armida, and she hasten-
ed to apprize her of the necessity of their

immediate departure. She had been al-
most insensible that day, but the terror
of falling into the hands of Wandesford
seemed to operate like an electric shock
on her frame: she rose, and though her
limbs could scarce support her, was, in a
few minutes, ready to be gone.
There
was no time to be lost, and, with the man
for their conductor, they sat off before
day-light for the camp. They travelled
in silence for some hours, and as the
pale light of a winter's morning broke on
the mountain road they were ascending
the horses suddenly became restive, and
plunged with so much' violence, that
Rosine, though now almost insensible of
inferior dangers, inquired what was the
matter. “ The horses are frightened,”
said the man.
“And what is it that frightens them?"
said Rosine.
“ There was a man hung in chains
for murder in the last rebellion," said

the man,
« and his skeleton is swinging
on the gibbet, in every blast of wind;
and I can't get the horses past it.”
The seat shook with Armida's con-
vulsive shudder; and Rosine forbore all
further inquiries.
The horses at length became manage-
able, and, as the day-light broke, they
saw around them a scene of wildness and
desolation, such as seemed an apt intre-
duction to the retreat of an outlawed
chief. The track led through a narrow
glen, broken by masses of stone, grey
with moss, through which a red, swol-
len, wintry stream struggled for a pas-
sage. Mountains, half lost in mist,
bounded the view on every side : a few
ruinous huts appeared on their crags,
which resounded with the scream of
birds, the beralds of solitude and fa-
mine; and the heath and the fern war-
ed in that rank and dreary luxuriance
that proclaims cultivation forgot, and
life extinct.


## p. 36 (#42) ##############################################

THE MILESIAN.
The track, at length winding round
one of the stony hills that broke the glen,
disclosed a wide moor, on the side of a
mountain, impracticable in the winter
from the morass by which it was sur-
rounded.
It was covered to the summit with
huts of clay, indistinguishable in their
colour from the brown soil on which they
stood. The crowds, with wild attitudes,
and hurried motions, the arms scattered
in confusion every where, and an indis-
tinct kind of military tumult, informed
them they were arrived at the rebel camp;
and dreary as their late solitude appear
ed, they could at that moment have
shrunk back to it with delight.
The carriage entered the camp, and
Connal did not appear. As they advanced,
respect seemed to overcome curiosity :
the men stood apart, and the women re-
tired into the huts, holding back their
children from gazing on the travellers.
The camp consisted of a number of huts,

built of sods and clay, covered with moss,
and strengthened with stones which were
gathered on the mountain. From these
rude abodes the rage of winter had of-
ten driven them into the caveros at its
base ;' and several holes in the ground,
from which smoke was rising, shewed a
number of these subterraneous retreats
were inhabited still.
Half way up the mountain stood a
dismantled stone building, which appear.

they stopt, and a woman appeared to re-
ceive them. Armida looked fearfully
around for Connal, but she did not dare
to mention his name. - Where is your
captain?” said Rosine, at length.
“ He has been absent these four days,”
said the woman, “ on an expedition, to
intercept some artillery."
Rosine eagerly interrupted her to in-
quire when he was expected.

you must see in this place ?"
She then went away, and Armida, who
felt sick at heart, placed herself at the
window for air ; but she was soon com-
pelled to withdraw, for the camp was
already filled with the report of an high
born beauty, of English birth, and im-
mense wealth, having followed the for-
tunes of their leader, and such numbers

No one but their female attendant ap-
proached them during the day ; but this
solitude only gave Armida leisure to feel
her situation more intensely, and neither
the superiority of her mind, nor the ener-
gy of her passion, were proof against
its terrors, now that the trial had arriv-
ed. From the scenes of her early life to
those she was now plunged in, the tran-
sition was too abrupt, the contrast too
shocking : she could not speak, and Ro-
sine dared not: they sat silent, each
wishing for the presence of Connal; Ar-
mida, because she felt it a vindication,
and Rosine, because she knew it a pro-
tection.
It was evening, when the echoes of
the mountain rung with a horn, and at
a distance they discoverd a horseman on
the heatb, advancing at full gallop : his

band, far behind him, in vain urged their
wearied horses to keep up with him.
The blasts of the horn redoubled, and the
camp was all tumult and exultation at
the return of their leader and his party.
Waiting neither for praise por congra-
tulation, he left his band to tell their
tale, and flinging himself from his horse,
which fell at the door when he alighted,
was in Armida's presence in a moment.
She tried to rise, but her limbs failed her,
and extending her arms to him, she sunk
again on the seat. Connal, who was
rushing forward, paused; but his figure
in this attitude of suspended emotion, the
glow of anguish and fondness that suf-
fused his features, and the flash of ago-
ny that darted from his eyes as be gazed
on her, awoke all the energy of her feel-
ing, and amid weakness and terror she
tried to greet him with one of those
smiles that was the offspring of happier
hours. This smile tore every nerve of

Connal's heart, and rushing to her feet,
and hiding bis face, “ Is it thus !” he ex-
claimed, “is it thus I behold
you
!"
“I have been ill,” said Armida, bend-
ing over him, “but it was only in your
absence: I am well already, since I have
seen you."
Connal, mournfully raising his head,
and gazing on her through eyes dim with
grief and love, tried to answer the smile
that gleamed from her faded features,
but his own were convulsed with the ef-
fort, and he turned to Rosine for relief.
" And you are here, my inestimable
friend !” he cried, kissing the band she
offered to him.,
Yes, ” said Rosine, " I have restora
ed her to you, and now I resign my
charge : Oh, Connal! be worthy of its
inestimable value."
“ I am not! I cannot be !” said Con-
nal, tortured with the various emotions
of his proud and passionate heart: “I

and, like the first apostate, I have drawn
down an angel in my fall.”
Trembling at his agitation, Armida
attempted to sooth him, and her effort,
though almost inarticulate, succeeded,
Alarmed by the faintness of her tones,
he repressed his emotion, and kneeling at
her feet, he gazed at her silently. It
was then when she looked at him and
saw his dark cheek, his matted hair, and
his features, from which the glow of
meeting had fled, and left them dewed
with toil, and racked with care, she re-
proached herself for the fatigue and dan-
ger to which she had exposed him.
“ Ah!” said she," what fatigue you
must have undergone for this meeting !
what a distance you have traversed since
the morning! I saw your horse fall the
moment you alighted from him.'
" It was the first moment I had done
so for eight-and-forty hours. The short
sleep I snatched was on the saddle ; and

myself with the other.”
“ And will you not take some rest-
some refreshment now ?" said Armida,
tenderly.
“ Yes, thus, for ever if I could, “re-
plied Connal, extending himself at her
feet, and pressing her hand to his beating
bosom. At that moment the horn sound-
ed, and Connal, starting from the ground,
hurried on his military cloak.
“ It is the horn for the evening watcb,”
he cried.
" And will you go without a mo-
ment's repose ?” said Armida.
“ I hardly know the meaning of the
word,” said Connal, with a stern smile of
military pride.
“Ah! you are bleeding too,” cried
Armida, almost shrieking as his parting
hair shewed a recent scar.
" A trifle-a scratch I received from
the sabre of one of those Hessians we
met this morning—the speed with which

not feel it till this moment.”
" Will you not stay to have it dressed
at least?” said Armida.
“I must first inquire if my men have
taken care of theirs; if they have, I shall
not feel mine.” He turned, and gazing
on her with agonizing tenderness, added,
“ Yes, I shall feel for ever that precious
tear that has healed and embalmed it.”
The guard was now assembled, the
sentinels changed, but from respect to
Armida, they were removed to a distance
from her habitation ; one only, spreading
his cloak on the heath, lay down beneath
her window ; it was Connal, exhausted
as he was by toil and danger : her pre-
sence, and the thoughts it suggested,
prevented him from closing his eyes.
The fugitives were as little disposed to
rest, nor for some time after they were
left to themselves had either courage to
speak. At length Armida, with an ef-
fort almost convulsive, said:

“ I need not ask what you think, Ro-
sine; your looks have already condemned
me; yet fear not to speak to me--tell
me all you think and feel for me. Ah!
how long will it be before I again shall
hear the voice of a friend ?"
My dear Armida, 1 do not condemn,
I do not even presume to advise ; my fa-
culties are only equal to common emer-
gencies : for the terrible conflicts I have
witnessed, I have neither counsel nor
experience; perhaps you have done best
in following the dictates of your own
heart: yet let me implore you, trust it no
longer with your present situation, but
avail yourself of the first legal oppor-
tunity to become the wife of Connal.
I know my importunity will be aided by
his."
The deep crimson that flushed Armida's
pallid cheek, her hurry to avert it, and her
ineffectual attempts to answer this appeal,
proved how deeply she felt it.

Rosine then approaching her, added
with solemn tenderness :
“ As I must now leave you, my dear
Armida, as I have remained with you till
it is no longer possible or safe for me to
remain, let my last words sink into your
heart. Connal is devoted to you : that
he has been criminal may perhaps be
the result of accident; whether he will
be so depends on you: employ, I conjure
you, every power bis passion gives you
to withdraw him from this guilty and
fatal association; urge him to supplicate
the mercy of Government for himself and
his deluded followers, and I may yet see
you restored to felicity and honour,"
The total desolation of her situation
struck like death on the heart of Ar-
mida, but neithier her pride nor her
affection would permit her to supplicate
Rosine for another moment's delay, and
she hastened to speak of Connal, that she
might not betray her emotion.

energy. “ But for him you would still

“ He has indeed,” said Connal, sud-
denly appearing before them. “ Forgive

guard are now absent on a patrole, and
when they return I must not be seen near
this sacred retreat : this is the only mo-

He paused to arrange his thoughts,
and then finding the effort vain, said
abruptly:-

it was impossible for Ireland to subsist as
an independent country; impossible for
her to exist without dependance on the
continental powers, or a connexion with
England.

the toils of conscience and purpose, I sat
gloomily down, and resolved to lead them

was almost indignant at stole into my
heart.

I returned I hated myself for having felt

remember the eventful night we met at
Lady Kilcarrick's? I had resolved to
disclose all that night, yet I shrank from
the thought of confessing myself a rebel :
I tried, by a tale of my banishment to
America, to discover how you would
bear the views of exile, and shame, and
ruin that awaited me.
“Oh! the rapture and agony
of
my
heart at the discovery, that even amid
exile, shame, and ruin, you would not
forsake me.
- That very night I flew to the cavern,
where the band, now grown mutinous for
action, nightly assembled. I was deter-
mined to break the bonds that beld me,
though my men should plant their pikes
in
my
breast.
“I called them round me, and, con-
scious of a new mind within me, address
ed them as I never had before. I know
not what I said, but I remember having

persuasion, beyond what man perhap.

acknowledged my crime in deluding them
to join it. I adjured them to disperse,
to surrender their arms; and if, as I fear-
ed, some suspicion of our design existed,
to confess it, to throw themselves on the
mercy of government, and make me their
hostage or their sacrifice.
Whether they had long before been
driven to think of this I know not; but
all listened with patience, and some with
conviction, and I am persuaded I should
have led every man that night a loyal
subject from the cavern of rebellion,
when at that moment Wandesford, who
had traced my footsteps from the castle,
and discovered the passage to the cave,
appeared standing among us. A hun-
dred pikes were turned against him in a
moment. I threw myself before him, and
swore they should cut their way through
me. But for me, he had never survived to
betray us, nor had I been an outlaw now,

remain unmolested; that

for a reinforcement.
“I saw you on the heath: I rushed
out to bid you fly from me, and returned
to perish with my grandfather. The

submission and to peace. Their Mile-

their aged chief and his grandson perish-

them to be gone and provide for their
own safety in vain. They rose around
me in numbers I could neither repel
or manage; and when the soldiers re-
turned we were in a condition to resist
their assault.
“ While I and a few more poured an
incessant fire from the narrow casements,
any grandfather was conveyed away by
some of his ancient followers, and by the
time I hoped he was safe in the moun-

thus upon their bayonets scattered them
for a moment, and we retreated to the
mountains : but every inch of ground was
fought with our faces to our pursuers,
and not a step but what was bought by
the life of one of my brave band. I will
say I saw Wandesford fight bravely that
night; he fought like a common soldier,
but we could not meet. As night came
on, the pursuit abated : the pursuers had
suffered as well as we, and the few of us
that survived reached the mountain by
midnight.

While we were still learning to grapple
with famine and winter, the guard one
evening found a boy, who was supposed
to have lost his way on the mountains.
Struck with something mysterious in his
appearance, they brought him to my hut.

acknowledged he was Gabriella. I still

myself from her, to commune with my

and at the risk of my life I led her back
that night to her own mansion.
“ You saw me on the heath that night,

“ The winter passed in fortifying our
mountain retreat. Nature, as if to ac-
knowledge the claims of her ancient
Lord, threw round us an impassable
fence of heath and lake, of mountain and
moor, and invested us with storms that
bid defiance to all assailants. We

ARMIDA sunk into a profound sleep,
and fancy, more propitious to her than
fortune, visited her dreams with images
of Connal.
She thought she was in Italy again,
surrounded by a splendid assembly; she
was singing to them when Connal en-
tered.
The company seemed to view him with
astonishment, and she broke off her song
to resign her harp to him. He touched
it, and every chord was instantly broken;
and a melancholy murmur succeeded
those brilliant and commanding tones
which the moment before she seemed to
be drawing from it. The scene then
thanged to those romantic shores where
she first beheld him.

He wandered before her at a distance,
which, though apparently small, she
couldnever overtake: sometimes be stood
on a rock, which she rainly tried to
ascend; sometimes on the brink of a
stream, across which he beckoned her,
but which it was impossible for her to
pass: yet, soothed by his image, her
slumber was delicious, and she wept with
that luxurious sense of grief that in sleep
appears to bring the recollection of many
years, and unite the present and the past,
the living and the dead, in its visionary
associations.
It was late in the evening, when awak-
ing, she leaned forward, and saw Rosine
and the woman, who was weeping, sit-
ting at the side of her couch ; and her
feelings, quick in the discovery of evil,
suggested no favourable omen from their
looks.
She started from her pallet, and in-
quired the cause.

" there is no time to preface what we
must tell. Connal's last appeal has been
rejected! he has been told to expect
nothing but the utmost severity. The
camp has broken up-they are all on
their march to the sea-coast, and Connal

As she spoke, the woman burst into an
agony of tears and exclamations, and
Rosine, incensed at her adding to the
terrors of the moment, turned to her with
a look of anger.

feel, that though I might die in this
situation, it is impossible I could live in

“ Judge then the effect of this exalted
character on my heart,” said Armida,
with solemn feeling. " I was reared in
luxury, such as few of my sex bave
known, yet at this moment there is no
prospect connected with his fate that has
terrors for me. Judge me not by these
trembling hands, or these broken ac-
cents," said she, as Rosine was assisting
her. Judge me by the unshrinking
resolution with which I follow his peri-
lous flight."
She then looked for a moment on her
splendid travelling dress, which had been
prepared for the English journey-
“ Ah !” said she, “this splendour is
not for a fugitive !" and she was going to
take off the oroaments that fastened it,
when, feeling that Connal might be
wounded by this appearance of self-neg-
lect, she desisted.

" When are we to set out ?" said she,
after a pause.
“ Not till midnight,” said Rosine,
“ for Connal and his party will remain
till last on the mountain, and light fires
to deceive the troops that he believes to
be hovering near him, and our departure
will be delayed till then, that he may
protect us himself.”
s It yet wants two bours of that time,
said Armida, “and before we part, seek,
I entreat you, an opportunity of making
one more appeal to his heart on my be-
half: I tremble at the thought of thus
wandering alone, the unlicensed com-
panion of the man I love. While you
were with me, I felt your presence a.

Dow deprive me.

dread of the world. Alas! my present
situation is a proof that I have no object
in the world but himself ; but there is
an unknown danger before me that deters
even me. The world may say she loved
unfortunately, but let it not say she
loved unworthily.”
Rosine, her heart glowing at senti-
ments so congenial to her own, hastened
out amid the tumult and darkness in
search of Connal, yet when she found
herself on the heath, amid armed men,
and flying women, in all the rude con-
fusion of a rebel army, she dreaded that
amid such circumstances the distracted
mind of Connal could scarce have leisure
to listen, or feel the appeal she was
about to make. Of the stragglers who
were loitering about she in vain inquired
for him; their terror scarce permitted
them to hear or answer, and though at a
distance on the heath, she saw some
bodies of men preparing to march, among
whom their leader probably was.

Their wild and martial appearance,
combined with the darkness, the clamour,
the crowd, the cries of various distress,
and the sound of military command,
deterred her from approaching them ;
and though ashamed of her fears, she
was returning, when near the building
that had served them for an abode she
saw a man extended on the ground, by
the light of a fire that had been just
kindled, and whose blaze was reflected
in bis polished pike that he had struck

She approached to inquire for Connal,
the man raised his head, and she disco-
vered the object of her search. The deep
expression of thoughtful woe in his coun-
tenance as she beheld it banished at first
the thoughts with which she had sought
him, and she only said, as he silently
raised his eyes to her :
- Your mind is beavy, dear Connal,
with the anticipation of some danger.”,

in resolution this moment as I must for
ever be in desert."
Rosine attempted consolation, but her
own gloomy apprehensions checked her,
and she was silent.
« Would to Heaven,” said Connal,
yielding to the bitterness of his feelings,
" she bad never beheld me--better she
had been united to Wandesford, to any

one whose happier lot would have pre-
served her from the evils of mine ; bet-
ter than thus to sully the brightness of
her mind among desperate men and des-
perate deeds: why did I ever raise my
eyes to her ? selfish, savage, remorseless
that I was, to tear those flowers of para-
dise from their bed, only to see them
wither beside me on this heath of blood."
" And here she would rather wither,
here she would rather die,” said Rosine,
“than live in palaces with Wandesford.”
And she shall not,” cried Connal,
starting from the ground, "she shall not,
if all the might that eyer was in the arm
of man, if all the energies of a mortal
mind can save her. Forgive me, Ro-
sine, for my coward despondency, my
mind is wrung with many cares, and I
know not what I said. Oh, who can
despair of the aid of heaven, when its
visible angel, stronger than a host, is on
our side."
At this moment of tenderness Rosine

anxiously urged the appeal which, in the
fluctuations of Connal's mind, she had
almost forgotten; and she represented
the distress of Armida at being yet with-
out a legal claim to partake bis destiny,
and she intreated him by their immediate
union to relieve her feelings from a bur-
then which pressed on them more heavily
than all the evils that menaced her.
Condal paused for a moment, and then
he said in a tone of stern decision :
Never, never, Rosinę! never shall it
be said by her proud family, or by a false
world, that O'Morven stole the daughter
of Lord Montclare, and forced her, in
an hour of danger and distress, to ac-
cept the condemned hand of a leader of
banditti. I am not worthy of her : I
am an outlaw: in the struggle I am
engaged in if I perish, I perish, and
the remembrance of my misfortunes with-
out my shame will remain to her. But,
if by one lion-bound I break through
my toils, and scatter those blood-hounds

side, then, in the face of the world,
and in honour, will I woo and wed her,
and then, the man who moves but his
finger against her does not hold -life at a
moment's value."
Rosine knew it was in vain with Con-
nal to oppose a resolution derived from
feeling high-strained and romantic as it
was, and she then besought him at least
to visit Armida before their departure,
and support her resolution by his pre-
sepce.
" And will she admit me?” said Connal:
“ during this dreadful day I feared nothing
but her sight, and though I lay down
beneath these walls, I did not dare to
enter them."
But at Rosine's intreaties he followed

he shrunk back, and did not enter till he
heard Armida's voice inquiring for
him.

There was no light in the room: the
gleams of a rising moon broke feebly
through the dismantled windows: Ar-
mida, pale, but collected, sat on her
humble couch,
He rushed in, and clasped her in his
arms: there was not a word spoken.
Rosine's audible sobs were the only
sounds heard for an hour. During that
time Connal often pressed his love to his
heart, and often tried to whisper conso-
lation to her, but his words were inar-
ticulate ; though, from the tones of
his voice, Armida derived more solace
than from the utmost eloquence of pas-
sion.
At length two men entering the room
announced that they were ready to at-
tend Rosine on her journey. Armina,
starting from Connal's arms, then clung
round Rosine,
" Best and first of friends," she cried,

How little did I then think I should
need your compassion, that I should
even solicit your prayers ! yet bestow
them on me, Rosine, for you are good
and religious, and those that love Hea-

• The blessing of Heaven,” cried the
sobbing Rosine, “and mine be ever
with you. Oh! Armida, in any other
situation, no duty, no force should ever,
ever have divided us; and even now a
word would make me stay. May the
greatness of
your
heart meet its recom-
pense! Ah! to me it seems as if no
object on earth was at this moment
worthy of you. Condal, Conoal, what a
responsibility is your's !"
They wept in silent sorrow on each
other's bosoms, till Armida, extending
her arms to Connal, exclaimed:
“I have now nothing left on earth
but you-but I wish for nothing more.'
Connal received her in his arms, and

while with one he held her to his heart,
the other, raised to Heaven, attested his
solemo appeal :
“ And when this fails you, may Hea-
ven and its bope fail me!”
Rosine, tearing herself from them,
turned to her conductors, and she ob-
served that Connal, with feeling pre-
caution, had selected men who had for-
merly been tenants to her uncle, and to
whom she was personally known. ?
She trusted herself to them with con-
fidence, or at least seemed to do so, from
compassion to Armida; and waving her
hand, with the faint and temporary tri-
umph of affection orer grief, she broke
from them; while her boding heart
whispered that she now beheld those
whom alone she loved on earth for the
last time.
When Connal believed her at a dis-
tance, and that Armida's feelings would
not be harassed by again beholding her,

now midnight: fires were
blazing on the heath, and their broad
and fiaring light was reflected from so
many fierce, dark visages, and wild
figures, half lost in the obscurity of
night, that Armida at first started back
from a picture wilder than even her
imagination had presented.
The men bowed with submission as
she approached, and though shuddering
at their sight, she tried to assume some
self-command, and return their homage
by a motion of graceful dignity, which
raised their admiration almost to a rude
murmur of applause.
Connal, who had thrown his arm
around her as he supported her tottering
steps from the building, removed it when
he saw the men, and led her forward with
a majestic deference that inspired its
own feelipg in all who beheld her.

.
The way they had to traverse was im-
passable to any vehicle : Connal placed
her on his horse, and then motioning to a
young man of the most prepossessing ap-
pearance to attend her, hurried through
the ranks to see if all was ready. The
men were all impatient to begone, and
after a few words to support their re-
solution, the sound of “March” burst
from his lips in thunder, and was echoed -
from rank to rank till the very spirit of
it seemed roused to catch and return the
sound.
The next moment he was at her side,
and she now for the first time since her
arrival remarked the change in his ap-
pearance. He had thrown off the Irish
dress, and wore a cavalry uniform of
green, but still retained the mantle and
the braided sandals of his former habit:
his neck was uncovered, but for the thick
curls that sometimes broke from beneath
his heavy helmet: bis cheek was pale
with toil and thought, but his large re-

fulgent eye, gleaming with the mingled
lustre of pride and grief, was almost too
bright to encounter: and as he approach-
ed Armida, the regal dignity of his figure,
mixed with the pride of the avowed
leader of a host, filled her with a spirit
like his own, and she said to herself. Ah !
no wonder such a man aspires to govern,
whom nature herself seems to have
marked, like Saul, for empire."
The march began, the fires that were
every where blazing on the mountain
shewed distinctly the arms and move-
ments of the men who were near her, and
though there was nothing like the regu-
larity of disciplined troops, either in their
weapons or array, yet their stature,
strength, and a gloomy resolution that
seemed borrowed from their leader, made
Armida shudder at the idea of such men
being encountered. Far below, the great
body of the rebel army was in motion,
in dim and tumultuous obscurity, and but

the light, as the wind waved the broad
and spreading volumes of flame down-
ward on the declivities of the mountain,
the whole band seemed like a cloud roll-
ing from its summit to its base. There
was no sound but the heavy tramp of
numerous feet on the dry heath, and
the quick and eager voices that called
out to avoid the precipices in their de-
scent, except when old Cormac, who still
marched by Connal's side, under the im-
pulse of enthusiasm, which neither age
por fear could quell, struck a martial
chord on his harp, and then sighing at
its lonely hollow tones sunk into silence.
Connal'did not speak, and he even seemed
disturbed when the wind waved Armi-
da's veil, and displayed her figure for a
moment to the gaze 'of the men : his
heart swelled with agony at the thought
of the high-born Armida thus being seen
by the eyes of rebel peasantry, the pub-
lic companions of their leader : and he
would not speak, lest the sound of her

inauspicious as their light, Armida beheld
their decay with a reluctant eye; when
she viewed tbe dim heath before her, and
the figures that passing over it seenied
like a shadowy host on the confines of
the world of darkness.
The silence, the darkness, and the mid-
night march of this ki visible army, which
she felt around her on every side, with-
out being able to distinguish them, filled
her with a kind of visionary dejection; and
almost appalled at her situation, she said :-
« This is not like the march of an army.
Can the spirits of these men be sustained
without music, or any of the pride and
circumstance of war: to me they'appear!
like spirits moving to the land where all
things are forgotten.".'

« The burthen of their cause gitsi
heavy on them,” said Connal, with deep
and agitated feeling. “If they were
victorious this moment, what would vic-
tory bring to rebels ?-the desolation of
their native land, the curses of their
countrymen.. Ah! it is a different thing
to march to battle with the imagined
shouts of posterity ringing in your ears,
. and to go forward with danger urging
you behind, and infamy shrouding your
prospects. No, let the trumpet sound for
soldiers : rebels march with a halter
round their necks."
- Why did you leave your mountain

gloomy words, “if you march only to
destruction ? There we were safe."
I could not hazard an engagement,"
said Connal : “ light alone remained to
us; and why should I conceal the truth,
you were the cause of that flight, or in
our wild mountain fortress we would

either to beg for the mercy, or to swell
the triumph of our enemies.”
- And was I the cause of your re-
moval?” said Armida, agitated alike by
his tenderness and his gloom. “. Then
my presence has increased your sufferings
and your dangers. Ah! shall we ever
reach the isles in safety ?"
We will, my love, we will : had dan-
ger been on the way, we should have met
it already; all the loose and straggling
adventurers of our band, with the women
and children, set forward this morning;
for if left behind I knew they would
never overtake, and had the enemy been
near, the report would already have
reached us through them.”
The dreadful thought that they had per-
haps perished and could now neither warn
nor join their friends crossed Armida's
mind, but she gave it no utterance, and
her own increasing danger banished all

visionary fears, for they had now entered
on a morass, through which bút one
narrow track led, and those who missed
it were immersed to their knees; and
their clamours and struggles, increased
by the darkness of the night, and mixed
with the cries of many •who sunk to rise
no more, filled Armida with horror.
Connal, again compelled to quit her,
consigned her to the care of the
young
man, whom he called Brennan, and hur-
ried among his band, where his voice
and presence, operating with his orders,
produced instant tranquillity, and the suf-
ferers struggled on without a murmur
when they beheld their chief on foot, ex-
posed to the same difficulties with the
meapest of them, by his personal strength
rescuing many, and by his patience sup-
porting all. On his return to Armida
he felt with his hands for the track, and
then lifting her off the horse, and
giving the reins to Brennan, bore her
along in his arms; but the moment he

withdrew the tumult was renewed, and
some of the men coming up, complained
loudly of the difficulties of the way, and
proposed that the band should remain
where they were till the morning broke.
“ Fool!” said Connal, “ go back and
tell them that O'Morven gives orders,
but does not receive them."
The men retired, but in a short time
returned, declaring that it was impossible
for the men to continue their march
through a track where they sunk up to
their ankles at every step.
Counal made no answer, but stooping
down he unbraced his sandals, and threw
them at a distance from him.
“Go,” said he, raising his proud
figure, “ go and tell the cowards that

moments a loud shout of applause tes-

After a march of four hours, the
morning breaking faintly, shewed about
a mile off the faint grey outlines of
the mountain, the first of a chaio, beyond
which lay the shores of the Atlantic: a
loud and joyful shout burst from the
rebels when they beheld it, and this
sound, savage and terrific as it was, re-
stored the spirits of Armida, and already
she imagined herself in the safe obscurity
of the islands. As they advanced, Conoal
drawing aside Brennan, pointed out to
him some object on the brow of the
mountain.
“ It is only the mist of the morning,"
said Brennan; "it is dispersing already;
I see it moving down the side of the
mountain."
Connal then shewed it to another, who
also affirmed it to be a cloud.
“ It is a cloud,” said Connal, fixing is
eye on it, “ that will burst in thunder
ere long"

discern'a multitude of people descending
from the mountain, with speed and terror
in their motions, and they soon recog.
nized them to be their companions, who
had preceded them in their march the
day before : appalled at the sight, the re-
bels stopt in confusion, but Connal know-
ing their present situation was the worst
they could encounter danger in, urged
them forward, and the first fugitives
soon reached them with outcries of ter-
ror, which Connal could not silence till
they had spread consternation througla
every heart but his own. They de-
scribed their sufferings in passing the
morass the preceding day, the numbers
that had perished, and the numbers that
were perishing on the mountain from
fatigue and want of food; and they added,
that when dispirited and exhausted they
reached the mountain, they learned that
a numerous body of soldiers were sta-
tioned there, to intercept and drive them

Connal listened without a sign of dismay,
and inquired if they had seen any of the
soldiers whom they fled from: all denied
they had, except one man, who persisted
in saying he had seen them march along
the ridge of an opposite mountain.
Connal, in the hope that this was but the
creation of fear, immediately ordered
his men to march up the mountain, as he
knew that any eminence they might gain
would be a better point of resistance,
even if an enemy were to meet them.
The straggling and unarmed peasantry,
with the women and children who had
composed the first party, were then
thrown into the rear, and they began to
ascend the mountain. The few huts on
it had been deserted by the inhabitants
the night before, on the arrival of the
former party of rebels, and they met
with no one who could tell them whether
safety or danger awaited there progress.
Half way up the ascent there was a wide

halted to recover breath and to recon-
poitre, a body of military appeared sud-
denly emergiog from a heatby rock that
bounded it, and forming themselves ra-
pidly into a line on its summit.
All doubt was now over : an engage-
ment was inevitable, and Connal, drawing
up his exhausted and scattered ranks into
what order he could, prepared for it;
but first, with an agonized heart, he
looked round to see what shelter the
heath afforded for Armida. There was
a cottage at some distance, constructed
like most of those on the Galway moun-
tains, of sods propped by the aid of the
large mountain-stones that formed its only
substantial wall : there he desired Bren.

power of reflectien or resistance ; she
would have staid with Connal, but she
tried in vain to collect the former energies
of her mind in this hour, and the ghastly
smile with which she tried to illuminate
her features spoke despair, not
lution.
When they reached the cottage,
she
sunk on the ground, and as Brennan
hurried back to the field, with locked
hands and breathless agony of expression,
she seemed to utter some request for
which speech was denied her. Brennan
broke from her, and the women, forget-
ting their own sufferings in the distress
of one to whom they looked as to some
superior being, gathered round her with
unavailing consolation.
Yet she tried to answer them with
movements that expressed gratitude, till
the tremendous sound of the firing pro-
ducing a universal cry of horror among
her companions, stunned every sense, and
clasping her bands closely round her

inward and heart-broken tones, « My

cessantly and monotonously repeated with-
out any change of word or accent struck
on Armida's heart more painfully than
all the cries of horror and grief uttered
by the rest.

saw a boy of three years old dying in her
arms.

the child.

man, “ she will think little of her own

" What can be done for him?" said
Armida : “ what is he dying of?”

her eyes, and fixing them with a ghastly
look on Armida.

feel it; there are many as bad as her,"
said one of the women.

peated the sufferer, " for this was all I

At that moment the child, in a dying
convulsion, caught hold of a part of Ar-
mnida's habit.
“ He is alive again !” said the mother,
“he's playing, see he's playing with her.”
The child carried it to his mouth, and
attempted to gnaw it.
• Merciful Heaven ! is there no food ?
is there nothing to save its life?" cried
Armida.
The child, attraeted by the sound of
her voice, feebly stretched out his arms
to her. The women about her would
have dissuaded her from taking it.
“Ah!” said she, “every thing unfor-

to reach a drink they had placed near
him. Armida, kneeling beside him, in-
treated for a little.
“Take it,” said the dying man, who
thought she was petitioning for herself:
" it may do you good, it can do me
none-I
am gone."
“ It is for this infant,” said Armida.
“ God bless you! God bless you !”
said the rebel, “ that can think of a poor
child at such a time as this :" then slowly
raising his glazed and sunken eyes to her
face, he recognized her, and uttered a
groan. “ Oh! King of Heaven !-is it
you ? is there no better place than this
hovel for you now?”

no more.''
His eyes closed, and though his lips
moved, it was with the convulsions
of death. A momentary trance saved
Armida the horror of seeing his last
struggles. When she recovered, she was
unconscious of her situation, but she felt
that if she staid beside the dead body
her reason would soon forsake her, and
she tried to rise from the ground.
Her little charge was too at rest ; the
effort it had made to swallow the nourish-
ment had put an end to its pangs, and the
infant and the warrior lay silently toge-
ther. She bad a vague idea that she
would disturb their sleep, and she glided
from the hut with the light step of mad-
ness, and wandered over the heath with-
out thinking of returning to the cottage.
The whole scene of war was now before
her : the firing had ceased.

enemy, discovered that they were on an

eminence, and between them lay a deep
and narrow glen, through which a moun-
tain stream ran struggling with the stones
that were scattered on its bed. He led
his men along the ridge of the glen, in the
vain hope of diseovering some place where
they were less exposed to the assault of
the enemy, or had a chance of compelling
them to an immediate engagement. But
in the mean time, the close and well-di-
rected fire of the soldiers thinned his
ranks at every step, while they, only
armed with pikes, possessing but few
muskets, and ill acquainted with the use
of those, were little more than an unre-
sisting mark for the fire of the disciplined
troops.

not even to Brepoan, of whose resolution
and courage he had the highest senti-

the force of action, and throwing himself
from his horse, with his sword alone in
his hand, rushed into the chasm, and
wading knee-deep through the water,
began to ascend the opposite side, with
å hundred balls whistliog round his
head. The boldest of his men stood
ap-
palled at this desperate step, and except
Brennan not one dared to follow him, till
they saw him engaged hand to hand,
grappling for life with a serjeant, a man
of gigantic strength and stature, who had
rushed from the ranks in the hope of
dashing him down the precipice: then,
with one dreadful shout, the whole party
plunged into the glen, and for a moment
it appeared to Armida as if the earth had
swallowed them up. Wading, climbing,

Connal, after dashing his antagonist
down the rocks, was the first to reach the
summit. The contest was now fierce and
dreadful beyond all example of ordinary
conflicts; it was a struggle for life, man to
man, and hand to hand, decided by mere
personal strength and courage,almost with-
out weapons: they fought with hand, foot,
and head, grappling each other's throats,
and feeling that if even an inch of ground !
was lost, life was gone. Bodily strength
and mere despair at length obtained the
victory. The ghastly wounds and resistless
thrust of the pikes in this close engage-
ment broke the ranks of the infantry, and
the rebels, after a tremendous contest,
remained masters of the field. The in-

fantry were supported by a strong party
of cavalry, whose object was after the
ranks were broken by the discharge of
musketry to charge among them, and
do their usual execution with the sword.
Connal perceived them approaching, and
remembering the event of the engage-
ment in 1798, in which the Lords O'Neil
and Mountjoy fell, drew up his wounded
and scattered ranks in as close order as
the broken ground admitted, and received
the charge upon their extended pikes :
these the cavalry, after every effort of
skill and courage was exhausted, found
it impossible to penetrate, and at length
retired.
The party who were advancing on the
opposite side of the heatb saw the for-
tune of the day, and after hovering some
time in a hostile attitude on the field,
retreated also. Connal and his men,
gasping from a struggle for life, almost
distrusting the evidence of their eyes,
looked round the heath, and saw not an

enemy remaining. Armida, from an emi-
nence, beheld all this : in the general and
wide-raging horror of the scene she had
lost all discrimination ; she heard the
firing without shrinking, and saw woundo
and death without feeling ready to die
herself at the sight. Her crushed and
close-drawn heart had room but for one
thought-the event, the dreadful event;
life or 'death; she was scarce conscious
of drawing a breath till the wild but
animating shouts of the rebels announced
their victory.
Connal, the moment he was secure of
it, rushed through the glen again, and
mounting his horse, galloped over the
heath in quest of her. The cottage
where he had left her was filled with the
wounded, and he felt fear for the first
time that day when he found she was
cot there. She saw him first, but in a
moment he was at her feet; and all war-
stained, darkened, and toil-worn as he
was, he appeared more than human : the

concentrated lustre of the warrior and
the lover, of every soft and sublime emo-

think herself with all her sacrifices un-
worthy such a being.
" Are you alive?” he cried ; "have
you your reason amid the horror I have
plunged you into ?”
« Ah !” cried Armida, astonished to
behold the man trembling at her feet
who a moment past was dealing and en-
countering death at every step, “is it
possible amid such scenes you can think
of me?"
“ Think of you !” he cried, straining
her to his heart : "if there was energy in
my thoughts, if there was force in my
arm to-day, it was only when I thought
of you.'
Brennan and some of the principal
rebels then came up with the intelligence
that their scouts had discovered the route
of the defeated army: they had traced

the rebels intended to pursue, whose
passage to the sea was now 'unobstructed;
and there was a village at the distance of
about a mile where, they might halt and
procure refreshments on their march. .
A short council was then held, and
Conna), struggliog with a wish to allow
Armida a short respite, and the convic-
tion that it was necessary for his men
immediately to reach the shore, did not
himself venture to speak, while his elo-

bound wounds, march by her side with
firm step, and eyes illuminated with
tenderness, almost felt it a crime to be
conscious of either weakness or terror.
Their journey was protracted by Connal's
taking a reinote route that he might
spare Armida the dreadful sight of the
field strewn with the dead and the dying;
and they did not reach the village till
evening.
The people at first fled at their ap-
proach, and the few who were left in
the cottages received them as men who
came to murder and to spoil, for the
neighbourhood was remarkable for loy-
alty, and had raised for the protection of
the country a corps of yeoman cavalry,
from whose vigilance the rebels had often
suffered in their excursions : they were
prepared for the worst therefore, when
they heard that the military were de-
feated, and the rebels on their march to-
wards them : and Connal, who knew from

protect the property of the inmates, and
save them not only from violence but
from insult. Provisions were liberally
supplied, and Connal, intent only on the
wants of his men, forgot bis owo, till all
he could procure to satisfy them was
bread and water-of these he was par-
taking, stretched on the ground, when
Brennan came up.
“ Is this your food, captain ?"
“ It is," said Connal, smiling.
“ The meanest man in the army would
have thought it hard fare after such a
day," said Brennan.
And I should blush,” said Connal,

"if the meanest man in my army could
bear privations better than his leader.”
“Ah! captain, you are fit to command
better men, and in a better cause.
“I might have been,” said Connal,
mentally, and a tear started in his eye,
but he turned from his companion as he
wiped it away.
The march was repewed at night:
their course again lay over the trackless
moor and the barren mountain, and
though the wildness of the scenery at
times dismayed Armida, yet its deep
solitude, flattering the mind 'with the
image of impenetrable security, soothed
and appeased her. It was about mid-
night, that after winding down the side
of a mountain, they suddenly plunged
into a glen, whose depth, and darkness,
and hollow echoes, made them feel as if
their progress was checked by an im-
mersion into a vault. The beetling rocks
that seemed to meet above their heads;
the moonlight faintly tinting their crags,

and sometimes darting through a rift &
gleam that chequered the glen; the red, the
hoarse stream that raved through it,
broken and tormented by masses of stone bi
that seemed to have tumbled from the
precipices above, filled even the rudest th
mind there with reluctant awe.
As they
advanced, Armida cast her eyes upwards;
!
the arching précipices above scarce gave
room for the twinkling of a single star,
and the numerous trampling of so many
di
feet, compressed and deepened in their
passage through the chasm, seemed to
her like the roar of distant cannon. The
horrors of that morning rushed on her
imagination ; her heart sickened with b
fear, and she forbore to express it only
because she knew the heart of Connal
beat still stronger than her own with ap-
prehension for her safety ; even he felt
the thrill of the place, and though wrapt
in meditation, spoke merely to disperse the
silence. Armida answered that she might
not appear insensible of his kindness, but

her fears rendered her almost unconsci-
ous of what she was saying. After a few
broken sentences uttered at random by
each, they relapsed into silence: Connal
then forcing himself to speak, mentioned
something abruptly of the skirmish that
morning.
" Good heaven!” cried Armida, start-
ing at the name; “ do you call that
dreadful conflict a skirmish ?”
os Ah !” said Connal, the tear trem-
bling in his eye, " I beg in vain to fami-
liarize you to what my own mind revolts
from ?, Pardon me, my love; it was a
bloody day, but you are safe.”
As he spoke, they suddenly emerged
from the chasm, and the ocean and its
moonlight shores burst on their view.
The rebels uttered a wild and tremen-
dous shout of joy as the hope of safety
appeared, and this sound, rising on the
perfect stillness of night, and the solitude
of nature, was the most awful Armida
had ever heard. They paused for a

moment, uncertain of the direction they
were to take, till the guides advanced.
“ What a night!” exclaimed Connal;
“the spirit scarce seems to move on the
surface of the waters."
“ Ah!” said Armida, viewing the
blue, deep concave, “I never beheld
such a sky without imagining there was
io its bosom some place of rest for me,
some elysium isle in that ocean of light;
far and deep, where the souls of the hap-
py. waited to receive me.”
- This is the last time I sha!1 traverse
these shores then,” said Connal, gazing
round him: “It is the last time I shall
tread this ground, and say this is my
native land; and I have wandered here
free as the winds, without a crime and
without a care. I would not have believed
a prophet that had told me that I should
tread them what I am now."
• But there are other lands, and
climates more bright and benign,” said
Armida, whose imagination already was

in Italy: " in that land of the sun where
I passed my youth, the land of flowers
and harmony, where rivers, whose mur-
mur is 'music, flow through her garden-
plains, there alone can we be happy."
"I never can be happy ont of Ireland,"
cried Connal: "I love her grey and
showery sky; I love her gloom: it is
native to me: her misty heath, her bleak
shore, the sullen song of her storms, and
her caves, and her ocean, are in unison
with the chords of my soul. The glare of
Italy is an insult to the exile : it reflects
no image of the country his aching eyes
are strained to recall.”
Armida trembled at the difference, of
their characters, and at the little hope
she had of entire influence over a mind

her own sentiments, and she ventured to
say:
"A country that excites no recollec-

Achilles inspired Alexander with the con-
quest of the east, and amid the ruins of
Rome Gibbon conceived the idea of the
history of its falling empire."
" And I too have recollections,” ex-
claimed Connal : “ on this spot my
ancestors were princes, and their de-
scendant has not where to lay his head."
The boat that conveyed them to the
isle glided rapidly along a calm and
moonlight sea: the air was fresh, the
night heavenly; and Armida contrasting
her present situation with the horror and
danger of the morning, would have dis-
solved into visions of hope, but for the
inquietude of Connal: leaning far over
the stern, he fixed his eyes on the shore
they were quitting.
Farewel, my country: he who is
banished from you would resign for an
acre of that barren rock the fairest pos-
sessions of earth: he would shed his
beart's best blood for the meanest of your
children --Oh! that his lot had been to

have died for you rather than have
fought against you.”
« Ah !” said Armida, mentally, “his
country was his first love, and from such
a heart its early impressions never can
be effaced : his country will also be his
last."
She did not speak, but by the light of
the moon Connal saw the tear that
trembled in her eye.
“Armida, there are moments when I
could almost plunge a sword into my
.
heart to give relief to its intolerable
swellings: love, grief, and disdain of
my fate, are tearing it to pieces. Alas!
amid all my crimes, spare me at least,
that of causing you a tear: my misfor-
tunes may sometimes wring one from you,
but from this moment my passions shall
be as hushed before you as this calm and

My past existence has often appear-

visionary ; real sufferings have rather
diminished my imagination; yet there are
many moments in the day when I find it
hard to credit my own existence. Con.

in an island in the Atlantic, with one
female servant, whose solitary figure

the rocks I see from my hut.

He went, deriving a hope from the great-

no other will justify. The rebels are dis-

Heaven, the ocean, the moon, and the
image of Connal: even death, accompa-

seems like one who promises me to con-

mist divides her, and whom she will lose

the latter of misfortune. The former I
possessed before I knew him, but the
latter can only be learned in its highest

But Armida had a source of inquietude
which she had no means of making known
to Rosine. Since Connal's absence, Bren-
nan had been employed to bring provision
to her retreat; and his visits had latterly
become so frequent, that it was obvious
this was but an excuse for them. This
young man, possessing the courage of an
Irishman, and manners above his rank,
had still more recommended himself to
Conoal by advantages of education,

He was the nephew of a priest, who had
given him all the learning that could be
procured in a remote country; but his
education, by extending bis resources, had
only increased his vices, while it enabled
him to conceal them. Ambitious, bloody,
and revengeful, he hated Connal, to
whom he appeared devoted, and only
watched for the moment when either as-
sassination or revolt would remove the
only obstruction to his assuming the
command of the rebels himself.
But from the moment he beheld
Armida, all his passions had been concen-
tred into one: and hatred for Connal, and
a daring love for Armida, felt like the
same sensation in bis breast.
During his frequent visits, Armida
felt his superiority to the men whom she
had seen with Connal; she even con-
descended to converse with him when
he spoke of Connal, and felt some

A few days after, as she was thanking
him for some trifling attention, he sud-

ascribed this insult to intoxication, turned
from him without even deigning to ex-
press her resentment. The next day, when
he again visited the isle, she expected to
have seen him humbled, and prepared to
deprecate her anger ; but on the contrary,
he appeared before her without confusion,
and gazed on her with looks that seemed

look now deterred Brennan from the
most frantic expressions of passion, not
without intimations of her desolate situa-
tion, and of Connal's absence.
Conscious that this was too true,
Armida struggled with her pride, anger,
and disgust, and though almost convulsed
with the effort, she attempted to speak to
him, but the swelling of her proud heart
denied her utterance, and again she tried
to break from him in silence.
“ I see my presence is horrible toʻyou,
said Brennan, indignantly, without retiring.
“ The presence of a friend of O'Mor-
ven ought to have no terror for me,” said
Armida, forcing herself to speak, though
her flesh quivered with rage and horror
at the thought of such a parley. But all
? her feelings were lost in terror, when
í Brennan, stamping with the fury and
imprecations of a demon, swore he was
Connal's bitter and eternal enemy. Ter-
rified at this menace, she humbled herself

you, for they follow husbands and chil-

“Ob, Connal! Connal!" cried Armida,
while the burning tears of passion, ia
spite of all her pride, burst forth, “what
can gou give to compensate for this

passions beheld her tears, and disarmed,

that proved the violence and mutability

able to speak, indignantly waved him to
begone. Brennan rose from his knees,
and slowly and sullenly retired.

in a hollow voice : "6

terror only increased his fury, and koeel-

most dreadful curses against Connal, and
against himself, if he failed in his pur-
poses of vengeance against him.
" Oh!” said Armida, whose courage
rose at his very name:
" oh! that he
were near you, those words would be
your last.”
Brennan started from the ground at
this threat, and the pride of conscious
courage, exalted by his passions, gave
his figure for a moment an air of diabo-
lical greatness.
“And do you think,” he cried, " I do
not know my danger ? Oh! I know it all.
The man that injures O'Morven has do
hope of life, but the man who has been
spurned by you has no wish to live."

to reach her habitation ; but a moment

“For me?" repeated Armida.
“ Yes, madam; O'Morven has re-

me to bring you to him.”
“ I don't believe a word of it," said
the woman; " don't go with him, my

Brennan was silent for some time, and
then he said the tide was rough on the
shore, and the boat could only be rowed
to the other side of the island.
“ And why could pot he leave the boat
there, and come to her bimself ?"
With another execration, Brennan told
her his business was not with her, and
again urged Armida to come with him.
“ If she goes with you, so will I every

and Armida, trembling lest she should
witness some outrage, rushed between
them, declaring she was ready to go.
“ You may go, or stay, as you please,"
said Brennan, sullenly; " but you must
determine soon, for O’Morven is waiting,
and I dare delay no longer."
"And I'll go with her, be it where it
will," said the woman : " I'll not be
trusting to the like of you for a guide at
this hour."
Armida by signs intreated her not to
provoke him further, but the poor crea-
ture was so agitated by her fears, that
when she attempted to go with them, she
screamed out that she saw the devil be-
bind Brennan, and clung to Armida in

protection did not appear to move him.

the glen grew darker, Armida cast her

summits were yet tinged by the moon : it
sunk behind them, and she felt as if she

When they were in complete darkness,
Brennan began to speak, but the sound

over, and almost whispering in that low,
constrained, horrible voice, that tries to
blend irony with an expression of the
fiercest malignity.

and dreading to urge him to frenzy, for-

spend itself in execrations. At length
the way became so rugged, he was al-

anxious to end this dismal journey, she

life-time, but how did she look then-as
white as you do now," and he held her
towards the water.
She was now convinced that her death
was certain, and sinking on her knees,
she attempted to plead for life.
" What is it you fear?” said Brennan :
" Have you ever done me an injury?
Have you ever spurned me when I knelt
to you? Oh! Never, never.” And he
laughed with the wildness of a demon.
Then checking himself, with a convulsive
effort, he soatched her from the ground:
his voice suddenly changed to a tone of
calm decision--" Your journey is ended,'
he cried. “ O'Morven is in yonder cave,”
and he led her towards something like a
chasm in the rock, from which the stream
they had crossed was dashing.

gering with horror, she followed bim to-

his arms, she was insensible. When ber
reason returned, she perceived she was
in a cavern. A fire burning on the
ground filled it with so thick a smoke
that at first she could not distinguish
any thing. At length, by the light of a
wretched taper that twinkled in a kind
of niche, she discovered a heap of straw
and rushes spread beneath it, on which
something lay extended. Brennan stood
beside it, appearing to watch what lay
there, and he had placed Armida on the
ground, as if careless of her recovery or
life. There was not a word spoken, and
Armida, scarcely conscious where she
was, had no power to break the silence.
At length a rustling was heard in the
straw, and the figure of an aged man,
ghastly and gigantic, 'slowly raised itself
from the ground. He addressed some
words to Brenpan in Irish, and there was
a kind of energy and grandeur in his
very debility, that made Armida, in spite

of her disturbed faculties, feel she was
in the presence of the grandfather of
Connal. They conversed in Irish for
some time, till Brennan, determined to
make her feel all the horrors of her si-
tuation, said aloud in English: “ I have
brought your enemy: she is in your
hands, and if she escapes, the fortunes
of your house are fallen for ever."
The old man turned to Armida. As
he viewed her his eyes blazed with mad-
ness, and their fiery and delirious bright-
ness, contrasted with the ashy paleness of
his face and his emaciated features, al-
most gave the idea of demoniac posses-
sion inflating and agitating a dead body.
« Traitress !” he exclaimed, though
speaking English with difficulty ; " trai-
tress ! you are in my power at last : you
shall at last feel it. I know you well,
though you assume that appearance of
youth and beauty to deceive me. You are

he lay: “I lie here in misery and fa-

" You
might have left me to rule in my barren

youth: he died defending me; but your

goes
childless to his grave.”
Armida, during the ravings, remem-
bered the story of his derangement, which
she had heard that night, and now saw
that the purpose for which Brennan had
forced her there was death aggravated by
the horrors of perishing under the hands
of a lunatic.

deadly malignity, he again addressed
O’Morven in Irish, and seemed to stimu-
late his exhausted passions to revenge.
The wretched maniac started up, and
with the mingled impotence and fury of
madness, he tore the straw from his bed,
dashed it at Armida, grinned with horrible
fury, and then fell back exhausted, with
an idiot laugh.
Brennan, then provoked to more than
the frenzy of madness, caught Armida in
his arms, and dragged her towards him.
She neither shrieked nor struggled, but
sinking from his arms, she raised her eyes
to him with an expression that might
have disarmed the fury of a savage; but
his heart was adamant: he knew he had
hazarded too much to escape from Con-
nal's vengeance, and his only wish was
that his victim should perish amid hor-
rors that would satisfy his vindictive
heart for the disdain with which she had
treated him.

onet which Brennan forced into his hand,
aimed it at Armida's breast : with the
rage of a monster he then attempted to
tear off the thin covering of her bosom.
Wresting at the same moment the weapon
from the trembling hand of the maniac,
Armida pleaded no longer for life ; she
implored only to perish in Coppal's
pre-
sence.
At that moment a blow, as if from the
arm of a giant, struck Brennan to the
earth.
Armida, almost doubtful of life, turned
and felt herself clasped in the arms of
Connal. She would have inquired, she
would have knelt, she would have clung
to him ; but there was no time for it
now, for, shaking her off, he was com-
pelled to meet Brennan, who had started
from the ground, and rushed on him with
the bayonet in his hand.
A momentary trance fell on Armida; but
she immediately revived to all the terrors
of their rencounter.

Connal had wrested the bayonet from
hiin, and they then closed in mortal
struggle.
Armida had lately seen many sights of
horror, but nothing ever like this,
where all the passions and strength of the
combatants were strained to the utmost
point in this tug for life. Their hands
fastened in each other's throats; their
nostrils spouting blood, from the force of
their gripe ; their eyes starting from
their sockets with the fierceness of their
struggle: they groaned, they panted,
they rocked, they writhed : the ground
was indented with the stamping of their
feet : the fire was trampled out by their
attempts to drag each other into it.
Brennan fought with almost superna,
tural rage and strength; but the strength
of Connal, though almost exhausted by
recent toil and fatigue, was far more than
his; and after remaining limb locked in
limb, and their heads buried in each
other's bosoms, Connal suddenly extri.

cated himself from this dreadful embrace,
and collecting all his strength for the re-
coil, dashed his adversary on the ground.
The cavern groaned with the shock, and
Brennan lay speechless.
Panting from his toil, a faint smile
breaking through bis sickening and dis-
tracted features, Connal then turned to
Armida, and when he reached her, he was
compelled to throw his harassed frame
on the ground beside her.
She was pale and silent : he spoke to
her, but she did not know him : he folded
her in bis arms, but she was insensible of
the pressure. As he still hung over her
with assurances of safety, he perceived
her bosom was stained with the blood
that issued from his own, and he then
for the first time felt the wounds he had
received from the bayonet before he could
force it from Brennan.
Dreading that his presence in this
state was the cause of her terror, he rose
and went in search of water to wash the

made to quit her, she gave a piercing
scream, and clung to him, though she
shewed no sensibility of his presence
when he stayed.
Bewildered, faint, and sick, he again
threw himself beside her, and watched her
countenance for a gleam of reason.
Her
eyes wildly traversed the cave, as if in
pursuit of some invisible object : at
length they rested on Brennan, who lay ap-
parently lifeless ; and her looks suddenly
became fixed, as if by fascination, to that
object. Connal observed him too, though
without any apprehension that he could
be formidable in that state. At length he
uttered a faint moan, and his limbs qui-
vered with a convulsive motion. Connal
believed the last struggles were ap-
proaching, and he spread his arm before
Armida, to save her from the sight; but
she still continued to gaze on him with
that intenseness with which we would

something he could not reach.
Connal attempted to rise; but Armida's
screams again detained him, and he was
compelled to watch this frightful scene
in silence,
Brennan still continued to crawl along!
one arm was broken by his fall, and he
could only move on the other side. He
felt with one hand about the ground, and
so fixed was his purpose, that when he
laid hold of one of the burning branda,
he felt its flaming point with his hand
before he could relinquish it, for his
sight was gone.
Connal, unable to endure this sight,
approached him to see if life could be
preserved, or would soon be extinguished;
but before he reached him, the desperate

and as Connal bent over him, he pointed

out its sting. Congal retreated, and
Brennan, with a shriek of torture, plunged

The
cry of the maniac, who had rc-
mained insensible during the copfiet, but
who pow started from his bed, mingled
with Brennan's dying groan, was too
borrible, and Connal collected his re-

cutrance, perceived the men who attended
him, but whom he had far outstripped,

Yes I do think that you might pardon him,
And peither heaven or man grieve at the mercy.
SHAKESPEARE.
WHEN Connal formed the desperate
project of seeking safety among his ene-
mies, he felt it necessary to provide for
his personal security by a disguise, as he
had to traverse the whole of Connaught
from west to east, before he could reach
the borders of Leioster, on bis progress
to Dublin. He assumed the dress of an
Irish peasant to conceal his remarkable
figure; and in the great rug coat and
slouched hat, the proud form of the rebel
chief was distinguished only in stature
and motion from the meanest of his
countrymen: but unpractised in dissimu.

might have exposed him in the noble
animal on which he was mounted, and

the proud grace and skill with which he
managed him. On the evening of the
first day he reached Eyrecourt: he had
been all day without food, and afraid to
approach the town, he lingered in the
neighbourhood until it was dark, and
then drew near to a cluster of cabins, in-
different to the hard fare and miserable
beds they promised : in the first he en-
tered a corse lay on the bed, and a num-
ber of peasants, as usual at a wake, were
singing, drinking, and dancing in the
cottage, regardless of the despair of the
widow, or her children, who were weeping
round her, conscious that their last far-
thing had been expended in doing honour
to his remains by riot and drunkenness.
Shocked at this scene, which he had too
often witnessed, Connal turned to a ca-
bin at some distance : be knocked at the
door, and asked if a traveller and his
horse could be accommodated for the
night.
" Come in," said an elderly man, who

was sitting over the embers of a turf
fire, his hands locked in each other: he
did not rise when Connal entered, nor
utter a word of welcome in answer to his
graceful salutation: he pointed to a
bench, and after gazing for a moment on
Connal's figure, which, even reclining,
spread across their parrow hearth, relapsed
into his former posture : opposite to him
was an elderly woman: her apron was
thrown over her face, but her loud sobe
spoke an agonizing heart.
Connal, weary, drenched with rain, and
without food all day, felt himself more
chilled by this reception than by all his
privations : there was nothing of the
cordiality, the
open and friendly glow of
kindness that communicates its warmth to
the meanest stranger that enters an Irish
cabin.
« That is a hard seat," said the man
after a long silence,

better to offer you."

months,” said Connal, “ and never wished
for it."
" It must be your bed too,” said the
man, if
you
lie here: we have had no
bed since yesterday."
“ I am sorry for it, for your sake,” said
Connal; " at my age, the ground is a bed
soft enough."
The man looked at him closely, as if he
was contrasting the language of poverty
> with the voice and look of the man who
uttered it, but could find no connexion
between them.
The humble sweetness of Conpal's
voice, combined with his lofty figure,
seemed first to perplex, and then to inte-
, rest him; and at length he said to his
wife, “Is not there a potatoe left in the
house to give the gentleman?"
No, we have not had one since yes-
terday you know," said the woman.
“Good heaven," cried Connal, start-
ing from his seat, " what is the cause of

this distress ? have I increased it, can I
relieve it?"
"No, God only can relieve us,” said
the man.
May he relieve you then!” said Con-
nal, fervently; but far be it from a stran-
ger like me to intrude on you, I will be
gone."
No, do not go," said the woman;
" I love to look at you; he was not so
tall or so strong as you : now that I look
at you, he was nothing like you at all,
but still the sight of you puts me in mind
of him," and she again wept bitterly.
Connal knew not how to console her, and
he stood irresolutely.
Are you from Galway” said the man,
I am," answered Connal.
“Do you hear any thing of the rebels
there?" said the inan in a broken voice.
“Oh! do not ask, do not ask him,"
cried his wife; “my heart will pot bear
it, my heart will break if I hear my boy
is in danger."

« This poor woman and I had a son,"
said the man :
we were in a good way,
and bad land near Galway, under Lord
Montclare, if you knew him, he that had
the beautiful daughter that ran off after
O'Morven the rebel: oh! my heavy
curse, and the curse of my heart-broken
wife there, and the curse of my whole
seed and breed be on him for a rebel, as
he is. We were doing well, and though the
boy was idle now and then, he was fond
of his mother and me, and we thought of
nothing but ending our days in the same
cabin with him and his, when the rebel-
lion broke out, and nothing would serve
him but he must go after O'Morven.
Oh, Tim, Tim, that was not the way
your mother and I brought you up, te
roam about with robbers and rebels, and
come to the gallows at last: and so when
I found he was gone, I did not care to
stay where every one was telling me of
my child's shame, and if he ever came to
be hung in my sight, I thought that my

grief would make me wicked, and fly in
the face of God, and never see him in this
world or the next; and so, though no one
ever gave me trouble or searched the
house, or took me up, I went away
from the place for good and all; but I
could not go far from him neither, and
so I came and took ground here; but
somehow, though every thing went right
with me before, every thing goes wrong
since
my
trouble came on me: I have no
heart to work; my hand is out if I try to
do any thing; the place about me is cursed
I think ; so I fell from one distress to ano-
ther, this poor woman and I, and yester-
day our bed was sold, and to-day some-
thing else, and I do not care what goes
next. I would not care if they would
take and throw me into the river there,
for I have such a sickness at my heart,
that I could not hinder a child from kill-
ing me if it would."
“Stop, Jem, stop," said the woman,
“ do not trouble the gentleman any more ;

see how he bides his face-he cannot
help us, and we need not trouble him
with our grief.”
Connal started from his seat; he drago
ged his dishevelled hair over his eyes to
hide the bursting tear: “No, no,” he
cried, pacing the cabin with agitated
steps, go on--if there be any thing
more bitter, more piercing, tell it all: I
deserve I deserve it."
The man and his wife exchanged looks
as if they believed their guest deranged :
“ What is it disturbs you, young man,"
said the woman, “what are you think-
ing of?"
“I am thinking what a beart O'Mor-
ven has to-night,” said Connal.
Oh, never name him!” cried the
man, who believed that the stranger like
bimself had been a sufferer by the disturb-
never name bim-God's curse
light on him and his for ever and ever."
Oh, do not curse him!” cried Con-
pal; "a broken-hearted father's curse is

heavy, and he is so wretched, he nceds
no malediction to make him more so."
Aye, so they say,” said the man,
hardly comprehending him, but terrified
by the wildness of his looks ; “ they say
he was forced to what he did, but it is all
the same to us, and those he ruins."
." But do not curse him," repeated
Copnal, “ do pot, good man: say you
forgire him ; day so, I implore you."
“ Well, God forgive him, and bless
him toc," said the man, " I do not care,
I have not the heart to bate any one, or to
kurse any one; I have not strength for it,
for neither I nor my poor woman have
tasted food to-day.”
Connal eagerly produced the scanty
sum he had reserved for bis travelling
expences, and desired the man to buy
some food : be went out, and returped
speedily with provisions, but sick with
famine and grief, neither he nor his wife
could swallow á morsel, until Connal's

the attentions of their lost child, they sat
down to eat, and pressed Connal to join
them.
“ I thank you, I feel no want of food,"
said Connal.
They redoubled their importunities.
By heaven, I will not touch a morsel
under your roof,"
" You look pale," said the woman;
“ I believe you have not tasted food to-
day more than ourselves."
No, nor cannot now,” said Con-
nal.
Do, do, take a morsel,” said both of
them rising : " if it was O'Morven him-
self we could not see him fasting under
our roof."
" And if it was," said Connal, gently
waving them from him, he would be a
villain if he complied.”
« Ah !” said the woman, " it is easy
to see you are not what you seem the

us is not fit for you-those limbs of your's

so I desire no better than the floor of
this cabin,” said Connal, " if
you
will
allow me to stretch myself on it."
“ Allow you !” cried the woman, de-
lighted at the plenty he poured on them,
aye, and think ourselves blessed with
such a creature under our roof."
“Cease, cease; you know not what you
say,” said Connal : "I am no blessing
to any roof;' and then recollecting the
danger to which thiş unguarded language
exposed him, he stopt.
Ah! you are too mild, too heavenly
Tooking, to have any thing to do with
this bloody business," she exclaimed :
"would to heaven that O'Morven had
heart like you--I see it in your eyes,” she
cried : “ you never were the death of a
human creature-you never seduced a
child from his parents to ruin him.”
“ God bless“God bless you! torturë

weary, I cannot speak to you as I ought:
if I have said any thing to offend you,
forgive me, and let me rest.”
The poor people, grateful for his
bounty, would now have given up their
wooden seat for his accommodation, but
he declined any bed but the floor, and
stretching himself on it, appeared to sleep
that he might escape their importunity.
: "Ah !” said the poor woman, “our's
are not the only heavy hearts that O'Mor-
ven has caused to.night.”
True, true,"múrmured Connal," he
has a thousand crimes, and but one life
to offer for them all-would that the
atonement was offered!"
His host was soon asleep, but Connal
could not close his eyes. Determined not
to quit the place without making some
reparation to these unhappy parents, he
in vain racked his thoughts for what
fortune had denied him: the little money
he had was already expended on them :
nothing remained but to dispose of his

horse, and this, though by delaying hie
journey, probably exposed his life, he
resolved oo. Some regret for-losing this
poble animal who had so often borne bim
through danger lingered in bis heart, but
he said, mentally, “ Let me be grateful
to Heaven, that amid the thousands in-
volved in my ruin it is in my power to
felieve one at least.**
Before day-light he arose, and gnawed
by hunger, saw with the keepest appetite
the remains of the meat he had purchased
for them the night before; but determined
to famish sooner than eat the bread of
those he had injured, he left it untouched,
and baving fed his horse, rode out in
quest of a purchaser. At some distance
he met a man, to whom he offered him.
" That horse is above my price," said
“ but at 'that house yonder
you'll be apt to get your money for him.
Squire Shaughnessy does not care what
price he gives for a horse."
Connal rode towards the house, and 2

he approached the gate saw the piers
were covered with proclamations offering
a reward for his apprehension. He hesi-
tated for a moment, but on reading the
description of his person, and glancing a
look at his disguise, he believed he was
sufficiently safe, and recollected that as
he had been seen in the road, a precipitate
retreat might expose him to suspicion.
He entered the gate as one of the grooms
was galloping down the avenue: he stopt,
“Young man, what do you value that
horse at?"
6 I am come with an intention to sell
him to your master," said Connal, “ but
I have not yet fixed on his price."
I'll tell you what it is," said the
fellow, familiarly : “sell him to me, and
I'll give you a handsome price, and some-
thing to drink besides."
Connal smiled, and declined his offer.
“ You are devilish high," said the
groom : “ what, I suppose you are above

" God knows, no one wants it more,
said Coonal, wiping the cold dew 'from
his forehead, 6 but I do not drink in the
morning, friend.!'.'
The man renewed his offer.
“I can easily see, my friend," said
Connal, “ that you wish to purchase this
horse to sell hiin at an advanced price to
your master, or some one else, 'but as I
am the owner of the animal, I intend to
have the benefit of the sale myself,"
• You the owner," said the groom ;
• a likely story indeed, that a fellow like
you should have such a horse; I am sure
you stule hiin.”
Connal's arm trembled to strike the
fellow to the ground, but determined not
to quarrel, he calmly rode on. Tbe
groom placed himself in his way.
“ You can't see 'my master,” said he ;
" he is not used to speak to such vaga.

from the rebels in the mountains.”
· My good friend,” said Connal,
coolly, “ let me advise you to be gone;
as weak as I am, I could pitch you over
that wall with one arm. I have no mind
to quarrel, but if you force me to correct
your insolence, the consequence will be
more unpleasant to you than me."
The man made no answer but by aim,
ing a blow at Connal with his whip.
Connal threw himself off his horse, and
seizing the fellow with one arm, flung
him to a distance, at which he lay breath-
less, and then mounting again, rode to
the house.
He had scarce declared his business,
when the groom followed with loud com-
plaints, and being a favoured servant
soon obtained access to his master, after
darting a look of fury at Connal as he
passed him in the hall.

"I do not know that you could, and I
am sure you ought not,” said Connal,
" when you hear that I bore from him
more than ever I bore from man, and in
punishing him only defended myself."
“ Please your honour,” said the man,
6 he came behind me and knocked me
down without my ever saying a word to
him: but if I had you out of his honour's
presence I'd make you remember me as
long as you lived."
“ You!” said Connal, his spirit rising
at this menial ipsolence. “Oh! it would be
but pastime to me to deal with you and all
your fellows at once: come on, the strong-
est of you, come all together, and weak

with weariness and want as I am, I'll toss
you as boys do marbles."
The men retreated, but the master
came forward.
“ You are an extraordinary man,” said
he, viewing him with surprise, “ to come
into my house, and brave me and my ser-
yants in this manner.”
“ I do not want to contend with you or
any man," said Condal, vexed at this
interruption :-“I came to know if
you
would purchase a horse from me, a noble
animal, that I cannot afford to keep :
your servant met me; he was insolent, and
I punished him ; unprovoked, I would
not injure a worm, and even now I had
rather I had borne that fellow's rudeness
than stand like a public Gladiator in
your hall, displaying iny strength on your
menials."
The gentleman observed him still more
closely, and then desired to see the horse,

oal at his request mounted; and, attached

to his horse, and conscious that this was
the last time he ever would employ this
faithful servant, he displayed his strength,
grace, and fleetness with a pride that
made the spectators exclaim, “ He alone
is fit to possess such an animal.”
As be dismounted, glowing with exer-
cise, but breathless with fatigue, the eyd
of the master was rivetted on him, and he
said, with apparent negligence,
" You
are a good active rider;: I have no ob
jection to take you as my groom.”
The colour deepened on Connal's
cheek, but a moment restored his self-
possession, and he said, “ I wish~-yes, I
wish to heaven I were your groom, or
the meanest labourer on your grounds -
but I cannotimin,"
The other paused, and then fixing his
eyes on him, said, sternly, “ I make no
doubt you have stolen that horse; I
shall apprehend and confine

character,"

" You shall kill me first,” said Connal,
almost ready to betray himself: “ I have
teen insulted, but I will not be injured. I
know the laws of my country, and he that
advances but a step to deprive me of my
liberty holds his life cheap."
The other smiled, and beckoned him
to a distance: “ I know you,” he whis-
pered: “ I tried you, and have found out
who
you are; go, begone-don't mention
your name to me: I am a magistrate,
and must do my duty if I am compelled,
Here is the value of your horse ; do not
employ it against your country: leave
this place. You are a brave man, and I
pity you."
" Generous man !" murmured Connal,
I may
live to thank you.” He gave
one look and one sigh as his faithful
horse was led away to his new master, and
then hurried to the cottage with his prize.
The old man was still asleep; his wife
had gone out. Condal seized the op-
portunity of enclosing the money in a

took of the fragments of their bumble
meal, and depositing the money under the
old man's head, quitted Eyrecourt on

compelled to shrink from the good they

A person who belonged to the packet-
boat noticing him, came up:

man ?" said he.
"I do indeed,” said Connal, with an
inyoluntary sigh.
“I can shew you the way to the ho-
tel,” said the man.
“I have no money,” said Connal, after
a short pause.
The man shrunk back from him : " And
what brings you here then?” said he.
“ If you can show me any place I can
occupy with less offence I'am ready to
remove to it," said Conoal,

the luggage boats," said he.
“ And what thed?" replied Connal,
looking at him with amazement.
“Why only that if you have no dis-
honest intentions,” said the man, moving
to a distance, " that you may as well
move to another place, that's all.”
Conpal started up: this last insult was
too much for him : the man in some
terror retreated. Connal could have ea-
sily overtaken him, but anger with him
was the bectic of a moment. • Merciful
Heaven !" he cried, “ is there some crime
branded in my face, that every where I
meet with insult and suspicion ? yes, I
feel there is : all eyes can read the crime
of poverty, nor is there one that makes
man shrink from man so soon.” The
sight of this man suggested to-him that
the canal boat was the swiftest and safest
conveyance to Dublin, as he would be
exposed only to the passengers, whose
number must be less than that of the

“I will undertake no menial office,"
said Connal, retiring : you

any
employment for me on the deck, you will
find me capable of it.”
“You seem a strong able fellow,”
said the captain : “ I don't care if I let
you come, but you must not refuse to do
what you are asked.”
“ I have already told you what I will
or will not do,” said Connal: “if I re-
fuse it is not my fault, but your’s :” and
he returned to his cold bed on the bank
till the boat sailed at four in the morning.
This was the most intolerable part of
bis whole journey: the dignity of his

were
with a degree of awe that made them
shrink from him; but in a short time his
mildness, his humility, and the readiness
ti
with which he undertook even the meanest
tasks, encouraged them to treat him with
IE
a familiarity, which, though he retreated
from, he could not repel. At length,
sinking into a corner of the deck, he
quietly'plied his humble task, and smiled
occasionally at the terrifying tales re-
peated by the passengers, who
talking to each other of the rebel chief
O'Morven.
- How much easier is it,” thought
Connal, “ to be the hero of a moment,
to wind up the heart to its utmost pitch
of suffering and of strength, and bid it
rest, than to wear life away in these
petty struggles, that corrode the strength
as the Alps were mined away by vinegar,
and leave us without consolation or
dignity.”

saw the spires of Dublin for the first
time rising to his view. The bank was
crowded with the relations and friends of
the passengers, who all hurried on deck.
Oo
every
side Connal heard the exclama-
tions of joy and the tumult of meeting.
He descended alone : no voice greeted
him, no hand was extended to welcome
him: he was thrust aside by the haste of
friends to meet each other : carriage after
carriage rolled away with their happy
burdens, and he was left alone at the
entrance of a city where he knew neither
a street nor an individual. There was
one person in Dublin to whom he was
recommended, but whom he had never
sèen, and starting at length from his
melancholy reverie, he inquired of the
first perion that passed him the way to
Francis-street. The person unluckily was
one who imagined there was humour in

from her party, intreated his protection
with so much earnestness that he could

the rush of the crowd forced them both

Connal could not desert his terrified

accompanied her to the box, where she

ment when the regal dignity of his figure
was displayed, and the pensive charm of
his beautiful features developed itself in
the inquiries he made after her alarm,
was augmented by the contrast between
that and his rustic appearance.
In a short time her party arrived, to
whom she mentioned the services she had
received from the stranger ; but the air
of constraint with which they thanked him
at once opened his eyes to the impropriety
of his appearing in the dress of an Irish
peasant in the boxes of a theatre; and
blushing as he slightly bowed to their
thanks, he attempted to retire.
It was Catalani's benefit: at that mo-
ment she appeared on the stage, and the
first notes she uttered rivetted him to the
spot. Arinida’s exquisite tones, and that
peculiar style that belonged only to
those two singers of all ho had ever
heard, rose with painful sweetness to

the admiring female.

While he revolved a thousand plans

persons behind him.

the age of boyhood, yet his career will

“But why don't he join his regiment?"

“ It is on

other; “ besides, the disturbance is quite

At these words Connal rushed out in
an agony, which, had it been observed,
must have betrayed him. For the re-

the house, almost unconscious where he
He wished to save Desmond, and
the information he had just received

distance, and pursued them till he saw

He knew that Desmond might bear re-

exhausted as he was, he continued to
traverse the streets till he believed he

the interview. He then knocked gently at
the door, and the moment it was opened,
passed the servant, and rushed up stairs.
Through an open door he saw Desmond
alone, stretched on a sofa : on a table
before him, by the half-extinguished
candles, he saw wine, a broken glass,
and a pistol. He sprung into the room, ,
and bolted the door. Desmond started
up, and involuntarily seized the pistol:
had it been presented to his breast that
moment, Connal could not have bid him
hold: emotion had taken away all power
of utterance from him, but a single
glance shewed Desmond the countenance
of his brother, melting with affection,
amid the struggles of grief, anguish, and
amazement. The first movement of the

outrage on himself, and he glanced with
horrible wildness round the room for
some instrument of destruction. As Con-
nal, fearing more for his brother than
bimself, wrested the pistol from his
hand :
“I will not live,” cried Desmond,

he was, Desmond was restored to sen-
sibility by this sight,
“ And you weep for me," he cried,
with penitent horror : “ you, from whom
misfortune never could wripg a tear'.-

destroy myself.”
And his own burst forth with a vehe-
mence that he in vain tried to smother,
by dashing himself on the sofa, and
burying his deluged face in his hands.
“Ah! my poor Desmond,” said Con-
nal, “ if your own reproaches thus con-
vulse your heart, how could I bear to
add mine to them."
“For what purpose then did you
come here?” said Desmond, trying to
harden his heart against 'his brother,
that he might rid himself of his pre-
sence. " What brought you to me?"
For a moment Conval was startled by
this question, but recollecting what he
had heard at the theatre, he recovered
himself, and replied:
" I hope to save you from destruc-
tion."
“Me!". repeated Desmond, with a

“ All” replied Connal, with convinc-
ing energy,

virtue of one resolution, you break from
the chains that bind you in this dungeon
of corruption, and rise a man, and free."
“Oh! she hung about me so !” cried
the fluctuating Desmond.“ My passions
were so inflamed by disappoiotment!”
Speak not of the past,” said Connal;
“a retrospect to evil generally leads to a
relapse: you must renounce her this
night, this moment."

a precept from me, Desmond, that I have
shrunk from adding my example to.
Would I-I did : this very woman, who
adores you, persecuted me with the
most shameful solicitations."
Desmond's fiery cheek and indignant
glances shewed how deeply this intel-
ligence wounded him, and he sullenly
murmured:
“ My superior in every thing! and did
I accept of a rejected 'wanton."
“ Nay, Desmond, ask yourself if at
this moment your vanity is not more
injured than your sensibility: at this
moment you are hurt not because you
loved her, but because she did not love
you : is such an object worth the sacri-
fice
you
have made to her?”
Desmond struggled with conviction a
few moments, and then said impetuously:
“ I am a wretch, the very slave of
passion and vice: I am not fit to think
for myself-speak, determine for me,

death be the consequence, the task will

“Subdue these passions, Desmond, or
they will destroy you: at this moment
your very reparation borders on error:
the path you are to pursue lies broad and
plain before you : return to your duty,
return to your regiment; employ your-
self in the business of your profession :
perhaps it will soon call you to trials
that will demand your utmost strength to
bear,”
“ And you would have me appear in
the degraded light I must among my
brother officers again ?"
“I would have you go before further

to appear at all. Yes, I would have you
join them, though I were convinced that
mine would be the first breast against
which your sword would be pointed."

feelings, he was upon the point of dis-

closing the whole of his situation to Des-
mond, but he was interrupted by the im- .
petuous gratitude of his brother, who,
grasping his hand, and almost kneeling
to him in the sudden change of his feel-
ings, oppressed and even tortured with
praises the man whom a few moments
before he tried to drive from his sight.
- You have indeed saved me from
destruction,” he cried : “ this wretched
woman, for whom my infatuation drove
me almost to defy you in her cause, see
how she has used me: this letter, which I
found on her table to.night, was to have
been delivered to me to-morrow.”
Connal read, and shuddered at the
depravity which dictated it: it informed
Desmond, that weary of his society, she
had fixed on another protector; that
pleasure was her object, and pleasure
was only to be found in variety : it
concluded with expressing how little
regret she felt at quitting a man who
had never loved her, and bad insulted her
by affecting compassion for her, while he

was only the dupe of his own vanity, and
her determination to make him the object
of her pleasure.
In this at least Gabriella had acted
with sincerity: if she had ever felt an
attachment of the heart it was for Con-
nal: the strength of his mind and his
devotion to Armida had enabled him to
break from her fascination, but she had
broken through all constraint in follow-
ing him: her character was injured, and
her passions were stimulated, and she
looked round not for love or happiness,
but for the most attractive object she
could discover. In perfection of form
Connal could be rivalled only by his
brother, and the youth and passions of

But with Desmond she was not happy ;

duced him even to sacrifice life for Ga-
briella, he would much more willingly
have resigned it to escape from his sub-
jection to her. This however was ter-
minated by herself, and in spite of his
wounded pride, Desmond felt all the joy
of a captive on his liberation.
" And this letter,” said Connal, “ you
were reading as I came: but how came
this pistol here?"
Desmond ' turned away, and Connal
shuddered.
“ Ask no more questions,” said Des-
mond: “

my
life.”
A long silence followed: the clock
struck four: the candles were just ex-
tinguishing, and the grey morning light
was seen breaking through the win-
dows.
" Where do you sleep, Connal ?" said
Desmond.
“ I will not sleep to-night, or to-day,"
said Connal, “till I have seen you quit
this place. I have arrived in Dublin

but to-day, but I' believe I have a lodg-

and I will resign my bed, if I have one,
to you.”
Desmond rose and followed him with
a submission that proved he had resigned
all self-government, and was only anxious
to be relieved from all further thought
for himself. Condal, soothed by the hope-
of restoring him to happiness, employed
every topic of consolation during their
walk, and his fraternal admonitions, so
mild in wisdom, so rich in affection,
healed the lacerated but generous heart
of Desmond, while they probed its
wounds even to the bottom. They were
admitted in Francis Street, where they
found the family already up, and Connal,
unwilling that his brother, an officer in
the king's service, should be seen with
him, whose real situation was but too
well known to those about them, detain-
ed him in a private room till the moment
he was to quit Dublin. Again the affec-

tionate heart of Desmond burst into an
agony of gratitude, and Connal in vain
tried to suppress the emotions that his
natural but ardent expressions excited.
As the moment of departure arrived, the
reflection of their next meeting, and the
prophetic words of the stranger, pressed
with intolerable weight on his heart : he
traversed the room in gloomy silence.
“ When shall we meet again?”, said
Desmond.
“Heaven knows, heaven alone knows,"
said Connal; “ where we shall meet
again."
" Wherever it may be,” replied Des.
mond," it will be consecrated by the
presence of the best of brothers, and the
first of men.”
“Cease, cease," said Copnal, turning
from bim : " Desmond, when we praise

hour should arrive, that would see me as
much sunk in the eye of mankind, as I

Impossible! Impossible!” said Des-
mond, kindling into rage though his
brother his own accuser.
"Nothing is impossible,” cried Con.
nal, almost losing his self-possession at
this unlimited confidence; then recollect-
ing himself, he more calmly said
“Should such an hour arrive, remember
that even then I had a heart for a brother."
They then separated. Connal listened
to his parting steps, and twice his hand
was on the lock of the door to call him back
and tell him all; but he said to himself:
“ Heaven may yet interpose to save me,
and is this a time to try him with fresh
wounds, bleeding as he is at every pore."
The moment Desmond was gone he
summoned his host, and inquired the
direction and proper mode of addressing
the distinguished personage whose in-
Auence he had hazarded so much to solicit.
"Ah !" said the man, “it is too late :

Ireland, and he has been succeeded by

This intelligence almost overthrew
Connal: his very soul seemed sickened
with sufferings and disappointments. He
did not speak; but the silent working of
his features betrayed more agony than
many words.
" And I have then quitted my post,
left my men without a leader, deserted
Armida :-oh, God! deserted her in a
barren isle, amid banditti-all in vain."
The thought of Desmond, and of this
disastrous journey being the means of
saving him, at last broke on his mind,
and his swoln heart seemed to respire for
a moment.
“ If my sufferings are made the instru-
ments of blessings to others," he thought,
“ heaven, let me not repine. How little
good can be done, and how much evil is
there to atone for."

with an agonizing smile, “I hardly know

in voluntary, it has been pursued too far,
and aggravated too much to afford a
prospect of mercy. He who takes up
arms against his country, let his cause bo
what it will, had better have turned them
against his own breast."
“ In the name of heaven," said the
man, " stay and rest this one day here :-

“ The grandson of O'Morven will not
purchase shelter by the ruin of him who
gives it,” said Connal, a faint gleam of
his native pride breaking through grief
and wretchedness. “I will be gone this
moment. I do feel there is that weight
of ill-fortune laid on me, that wherever I

The man then importuned him with
such urgency of distress and affection to
stay but a few hours, that Coppal felt
almost subdued.

ing his burning forehead with his hand,
in which a thousand pulses seemed beat-
ing: “ I believe I must yield to this
weakness for once.'

and intense fatigue operating with this
rare indulgence, procured him a long
and tranquil sleep.
It was evening when he awoke, and,
reproaching himself for the delay, he rose
hastily, and after a slight refreshment,
which the importunity of his host forced
on him, he was hurrying away, when the
recollection of his utter destitution oc-
curred to him, and returning, with a
cheek dyed in crimson, he was compelled
to borrow a small sum for his journey,
which, however, he scrupulously limited
to the mere demands of necessity. He

One still continued to follow him with
solicitations which he blushed to hear
from a female, and at length caught
hold of his arm, and attempted to detain
him with a smile of invitation, but the
poor wretch's features were so ghastly
with famine that her smile was like the
yawn of a sepulchre. Shuddering with
pity and horror, he attempted gently to

Struck with her sight, which recalled
so many early associations, his heart
melted within him, and the daring leader
of the rebels wept over a perishing pros-
titute,

He attempted to support her there; but
exhausted by famine, she was unable to
proceed, and Connal, fearing she would
perish in his arms, rushed into a public-
house that was still open, to demand some
assistance for her.
A man followed him to where she was
leaning against the corner of the house;
but when he saw her rags, her squalid
face, and the filth with which she was
covered from her fall, with a savage oath
he bid Connal take care of his strumpet,

told Lord Montclare's daughter all about
him, and he had me taken up, and
threatened my life, so that I was forced
to take my oath on the sacrament I would
go to Dublin, and never trouble him
more : so I came, and misfortune follow-
I don't know how I have lived
latterly; but to-night I got desperate;
hearing the child cry, and looking at the
hungry walls, I ran out to get a morsel for
it any way, and. I met you : it was a
blessed meeting, for though I must die,
my child will not.”
" It shall not! it shall not !” cried
Connal, melting with compassion, "while
I can earn a morsel for it."

A gleam of passion trembled in her
dying eyes :
“ The beautiful daughter of Lord
Montclare never loved you more than I
did, but she deserved you better."
Speak no more,” said Coonal, start-
ing at the name : you exhaust your
strength. Try if you can reach your
lodging now.'
She attempted to obey him, but in vain,
and he was obliged to bear her in his
arms to her miserable mansion.
The child was asleep on some straw.
Connal hurried out, after laying the mo:
ther beside it, for food for them both;
but every place was now shut, and after
traversing every street he knew, he was
compelled to return, and sit beside the
bed of death.
She knew him still, and when, throwing
himself on the ground beside her, he
took her damp, convulsed hand, she
struggled to smile on him, and when he

removed her dishevelled hair and wiped
the cold drops from her forehead, her
lips moved to thank him, though the
power of speech was gone.
Connal bad witoessed and encountered
death where it had stared him in the
face, and been dealt to his naked breast,
blow after blow, till he wondered at his
own safety, and he wished himself in such
a scene again, while compelled to watch
this slow and painful gradation of life.
ller last effort was to clasp her hands to-
gether in supplication, and then try to
extend them to her child, whom she thus
committed to his care with the dumb elo-
quence of death.
Counal, whose attention to her had not
remitted for a moment, now turned to the
child, and gazed on it, believing it asleep.
" This is my enemy's child,” he said:
vif I love it, it must be because my
heart is not devoid of humanity. I
was not formed for the scenes of violence

into which I have been forced :-oh!
that the streams, for want of which my
heart has been so long withered, may once
more be permitted to flow in their natu-
ral channels, that I may live to those
whom I love and am loved by.”
Yielding to the emotions that over-
flowed his heart, he stooped to kiss the
infant as it lay: he was struck by the
coldness of its touch. He raised it in his
arms :. it was dead : it had slept its life
away, and lay at rest beside its mother.
The people of the house soon entered,
to strip the bodies of their miserable
clothing, and the room of every thing
it contained, except the straw on which
they lay.
Connal was then left alone with the
corses, and unable to leave their remains
without one witness to save them from
indecent neglect, he continued to lean
agaiost the bare walls till a coffin, pro-
vided by the parish, was procured, and
he expended the remainder of his scanty

stock to bribe one attendant to follow
them to the grave.
It was night when he commenced his
journey. The fate of Mary had taken
from him all thought of his own, and he
set out without reflecting how a journey
of upwards of a hundred and twenty
miles could be perforined by an indivi-
dual destitute of the means of procuring
a single meal.
As he entered on the circular road, he
observed a horseman, who appeared to be
waiting for some passenger; he rode a
few paces forward, and then retired to
the side of the road. Connal advanced

spoke, dismounting, he put a purse into
Coñnal's hand, threw the reins of his
horse over his arm, and springing over a
low wall, disappeared in a moment.
Connal, thus unexpectedly delivered
from difficulties with which it was almost
impossible to contend, pursued his journey
with resolutions to indemnify, by any sa-
crifices that nature could spare, the ge-
nerous man who had thus contributed to
his safety.
He proceeded with such expedition
that on the second night he reached
Loughrea, and dark as his prospects
were, Armida's look, her smile, broke
like a beam of light on his heart, and he
felt it was impossible for those who love
to despair, though nothing but the ob-
ject was left to them in life. As he rode
slowly along the border of the lake, a
delicious calm breathed itself into his
soul; the enthusiasm of love made all
things seem possible; a dream of future
happiness wandered over his heart; and

his late' stormy existence seemed to disa
perse before its light.
As be turned into the dreary road that
leads to Gort, he heard the report of a
pistol close to him, and the ball, whizzing
in his ear, passed through his hat, within
two inches of the brain. He started,
but was instantly compelled to exert all
his strength to manage his terrified horse,
and, while drawing up the reins, was
dashed from his seat by a blow that
seemed given by a flail. He fell, and
while trying to disentangle himself from
the reins, three men rushed on him at
once: two fastened on him as he lay, ap-
parently with intent to strangle him.
With convulsive strength be rose, tore
himself from their gripe, and dashed one
of tbem to the ground with a force that
left him senseless; but, while grappling
with the other, he felt himself several
times wounded in the back by the third,

him, with whom, though on one knee,
he was almost on a level in height, he
tore the instrument from his hand : it
was a case-knife, and the edge, as he
wrenched it away, gashed his own al-
most to the bone, but he yet retained
strength enough to plunge it twice into
the ruffian's side. He fell with a groan,
which thrilled Connal with horror, for
he had never yet shed the blood of a
fellow-creature in a personal conflict.
There was but one now to be dealt
with, for one lay breathless, and the
other apparently dead. As Connal, stage
gering with horror and loss of blood,
approached him, the wretch threw him-
self on his knees, and supplicated for
mercy, though Connal was unarmed. At
that moment the light of the moon, as it
rose over the Lake of Loughrea, fell on
his face, and Connal beheld one of his
own men.

he wiped away the cloud of mist and

when close to the man, "he was unable to
ask him the cause of this attempt, but
gazed on him with eyes that doubted
their own evidence.
“ Spare my life, spare my life !” cried
the wretch, in an agony of terror; “I
had an oath I could not break: I had an
oath to take your life."
“To take my life !” repeated Connal:
“ I twice saved your's: I remember you
well."
“Oh! I am a dying man,” cried the
murderer, writhing on the ground in tor-
ture: “ I feel I have broken a limb in that
struggle I had with you; I did not think
you were so strong, or I never would
have attempted it.”
“ You might have known it well,”
said Connal; “ for twice but for me you
would have perished the night we march-
ed from the mountain. Little did I think
to have seen your hand aimed against my
life, to whom you owed your own."

Oh, Christ, I shall die!" cried the
sufferer, screaming with bodily and men-
tal anguish: “ I shall die, and my soul
must go to hell. I have no priest, and
there is a curse on my soul if I did not
do what I swore, and I have no priest.”
" You have a God,” said Connal,
solemnly pointing to heaven.
« Oh! don't talk to me of heaven,"
said the wretch ; " so much the worse for
me if there is. Help me to some cabin
if you can: I knew you would be mer-
ciful, so I did not care what happened,
and that was what made me more ready
to take your life.”
“ You shall not be disappointed in
the mercy you expected,” said Connal,
“ though never was one more unworthy
of it."
He then pursued, and caught his horse,
and attempted to place the man on it,
but the least movement of the animal was
such intolerable pain to him, that Connal

was compelled to lift him in his arms,
and proceed on foot with him to the next
cabin. A boy was then sent to the town
for assistance: a military surgeon was
brought, and Connal, insensible of dan-
ger when humanity invoked him, per-
formed offices about the patient which
the people of the cabin shrunk from: he
held, soothed, and sustained him, while
the fracture was examined, and the dress-

nil's presence he would have refused to

blood, he exclaimed with astonishment
at his neglect of himself, and begged to
examine his wounds.
They are not worth attention, sir,"
said Connal: "a few scratches that I
got defending my servant from the ruf-
fians who attacked us.”
But as he spoke, the deadly sickness,
that he felt, and the cold drops with
which his face was bedewed, made him
feel the necessity of yielding to his friendly
importunities; and when he submitted to
be undressed, the deluge of blood that
still issued from his wounds, and drenched
the bands of the surgeon, filled him with
mingled horror and admiration.
- Good God !” said he, “is it possible
that man could bear what you must have
borne without a murmur?"
“ I was occupied by my attendance on
that poor object,” said Connal, “and
scarce felt I was wounded, till my clothes
were soaked in blood.”

;" He ought to be a valuable servant to
such a master," said the surgeon.
Connal sighed, and at that moment the
thought of this man's ingratitude was the
only wound he felt.
He liberally re-
warded the surgeon, and the moment he
retired, returned to the road to discover
if any traces of the other two assassins
remained. There was no appearance of
them : some marks of blood were on the
road, and the knife with which he had
been wounded. The man, who had been
only stunned, recovered, and finding his
companion dead, had flung his body into
the lake, and fled. Connal, alter exa-
mining every adjacent spot by the moon,
was compelled to return to the cabin, and

All day Connal listened to his ravings,

close confinement, the infected air, the
anguish of his wounds, and the agitation
of his mind, at length subdued him, and
he felt the same fire burning in his veins
with which those of his companion were
scorched. Still not daring to quit the
cabin, for fear of the delirious cries of
the sick man betraying him to an acci-
dental passenger, he continued to aggra-
vate his complaint by want of air, re-
freshment, and the damp of the cabin

that summer prolonged his sufferings,
and for three months he was lost in alter-
nate paroxysms of stupor and delirium:
when he recovered, not the slightest
trace of former events returned to his
mind, nor was there any thing around
him to recall them : he found himself
stretched on a bed, in a room he had
never seen before: an old man was sitting
on the foot of the bed with his back to
him: Connal sat up, and looking round,
uttered a few words of reason: the old
man turned, and sinking on his knees, the
sudden burst of joy and devotion with
which he welcomed this glimpse of sanity
· almost extinguished it :“Don't you know
me?” he cried, kneeling beside Connal,
and kissing his white emaciated hand :

sky, seemed like a part of the rock it
towered on: as he gazed on it with
many emotions, he observed on an angle
of the rock where it rose perpendicularly
from the ocean a figure of the most
delicate texture standing alone, and its
solitude, combined with its aërial slight-
ness, made it scarcely appear human.
“Ah !” whispered Desmond,“ if that
should be Endymion."
It was indeed that unhappy girl, the
victim of her mother's selfish ambition,
who, pining with a passion for which
she had no name, had laboured under a
partial derangement of reason since Des-
mond's absènce from the castle, and was
permitted to wander about the rocks
alone in the evening, as the only relief of
which her malady seemed susceptible.
At the sight of Desmond, uttering a

sbriek of joy, she darted towards him,
nor did she perceive in the twilight the
altered figure of Desmond; his fever-
ed cheek, and the agitation of his
manner when he attempted to address
her.
The ionocence of Endymion, her igno-
rance even of her sex, her unconscious-
ness of every thing but her attachment
to him, seemed the bitterest of unuttered
reproaches to his early experience in vice
and passion.
" Ah, Desmond," she cried, “where
have you been? I have wandered every
night on these rocks to meet you. They
told me you were gone, but I could not
believe them: I was sure I should meet
you at last. Where have you been ?
You look as if you came to me from
another world."
“From another world indeed," said
Desmond, sighing; " I wish not to re.
: member where I have been."

“And are you come to be present at
this marriage?” said Endymion.
- What marriage ?"
“ The marriage of your father and my
mother: it is to take place to-night they
tell me."
" My father and your mother!" re-
peated Desmond, turning pale with hor-
ror; “impossible ! it cannot be."
“Oh, yes, they are to be married to-
pight.”
" Not if I can prevent their union,”.
cried Desmond, rushing from her.
- Good heaven, what do you tell me?
and in what an hour am I come !!! he
continued.
His dread of this union overpowering
every thing, he hurried into the castle.
Endymion, whose state of mind was
rapidly verging to a confusion of the real
and visionary, now doubted, from the
suddenness of his departure, whether it
was him she had seen, and sitting down.

her fancy in vain attempts to recall the
vision that had appeared to her....
Desmond in the mean time was tra-
versing the castle in search of his father.
As he passed through the gallery a door
suddenly opened, and Lady Montclare,
her mourning weeds exchanged for bridal
white, and her fine figure sparkling with
jewels, appeared at it. -
She started at his sight, but a moment
after advanced and extended her hand to
him.
Desmond indignantly retreated,
“ Desmond," she cried, in the softest
tones of insinuation; “ Desmond, do you
not know me?” ,
“Never, I hope, as' my father's wife,”.
said Desmond, his heart swelling with
grief and rage at her confidence.
“What do you mean by those words,
Desmond ?" said Lady Montclare,
smothering her resentment. . . .

subdued voice; “I supplicate your
mercy for my father, you know too well
there are circumstances which must re-

She turned suddenly on him as he
followed her...
“Desmond, have mercy on yourself:

She had lived in dread of detection

Wandesford and the O'Morvers had

should discover the secret, as it would
then become his interest to preserve it.
It grew dark, and Desmond was still
leaning, almost unconsciously, where
Lady Montclare had left him, when he
was startled from his reverie by the sound
of his father's voice, who was approach-
ing with, the priest.
Desmond advanced, trembling and
scarce knowing how to address him. .
O'Morven seemed overcome with con•
fusion at the sight of his son : he ex-
pressed his joy at seeing him, wondered

where he had been, and what had
brought him to the castle, without waita'
ing an answer.
- To witness an extraordinary event,"
said Desmond, with a feeling he could
not repress : “ will you allow me, sir, to
speak with you one moment in pri-
- vate ?"
" Father Morosini may be a witness
of whatever you ought to say,” said
O’Morven.
“Is he your son, sir?” said Desmond,
with increasing anguish; “is it neces-
sary he should witness the first conference
• of a father and child who have not met
for almost a year?" .
O’Morven then sullenly walked aside
with him, and Desmond, closing the
door on the officious priest, advanced to
his father.
" Father, am I too late to prevent this
fatal marriage ?"

“What do you mean ?" said O'More
ven.
"I cannot tell you,” said Desmond,
almost choaked with emotion; - but be
assured that it is no commoti cause that
could agitatë me thus: if this union were
for your happiness or honour; I would
not thus kneel to you to prevent it.”
"I'cannot comprehend you," said his

The room in which they were opened
on the rocky terrace that commanded the
sea, and Desmond rushed out on it, al-
most wishing himself in the waves that "
beat below.
Endymion was still seated on the rock.
where he had left her, and his heart
thrilled with agony while he thought
that this strange union boded some evil
to this ill-fated victim of another's, evil
and falsehood; yet as he approached he:
was involuntarily soothed by the contem-
plation of her beauty, the dark luxu-
riance of her hair, the touching colour
of her face, and her air, neither mascu.
line or feminine, that seemed not to be
long to mortal beauty.
“ Are you not afraid of the chill air on
these rocks, Endymion ?." said he, hang-
ing over her: “ that cheek is too delicate
for our rough winds; yet I think you:
have lost something of your Italian pale-
ness since I saw you."

Endymion put her hand to her cheek,
and Desmond gazed on the delicacy of
both, so unsuitable to the dress she had
been compelled to assume.
- I am glad,” said she," that any thing
has diminished the unfortunate fragility
of my appearance, which I fear makes me
still more the object of your batred.”
" My hatred !” cried Desmond : "oh,
, heavens! can I appear to hate you ?".
Endymion with strong emotion pointed
to the castle from which his arrival had
excluded the O’Morvens.
“Ah!" thought Desmond,“ how lit-
tle does she know that a single word of
mine could overthrow those claims, of
whose falsehood she is unconscious.”.
" I have excluded your brother and
you from that castle,” said Endymion,
with a sigh that seemed to torture her
slight frame; " yet that castle, aye, the
whole world, would I give to be that
brother you love so well.” ::. .

Every nerve in Desmond's frame trem-
bled with delight to bear her thus un-
consciously avow her passion; and he
had scarce resolution left to feel the dan-
ger of this interview, and, repressing
what he was about to say, turned towards
the castle.
- Endymion followed him, and twining
her arm in his, complained of weariness,
"I was not so feeble in Italy,” said
she; “ I was as light as a bird, but now
at times the very air seems to oppress
me.”
. “ Do you wish to be in Italy again,
then?" said Desmond.
." In Italy!” repeated Endymion : "oh!
that the sea had swallowed me when I
quitted its shores: oh! that you had suf-
fered me to perish the first night of our
meeting, or saved me to see you once,
and die.”.
Desmond, terrified at this burst of fren-
zied passion, implored her to be calm,

and as he spoke, involuntarily his arms
were fulded round her.
“If you wish me to be calm,” said
Endymion, struggling faintly to break
from him, while her dissolving eyes be-
lied her struggles ; “ if you wish me to
be calm, release me from your arms, for
while your voice; your touch, is so near
me, I am wild.”
..^ I will release you,” said Desmond,
dejectedly: “ I will be gone, if you wish
me; only tell me what I shal do to make
you tranquil.”
To make me tranquil!” a flash of
real madaess darted from her eye: "oh,
snatch me to your heart! Hold me to it
one moment, but one moment, 'and the
next plunge me into those waters that are
rolling at your feet." "
As she spoke, she flew from him, con-
scious she had said something she ought
not, though searçe remembering it.
Desmond, bewildered and tormented,

continued to wander on the rocks, till
wearied he threw himself on them to
think of the sounds he had heard trem-
bling on the midnight wave on his pas
sage to England—those sounds so sweet
and mournful, that they seemed to an-
nounce the future influence of Endymion:
on his destiny:
The night he first heard them all was
calm, smooth, and bright, like his mind
before he beheld her. Now the evening
had grown dark and gloomy, the cold
rain fell round him, the rising wind hissed
sadly on the bleak rocks, and the sounds
he heard were like the knell of those wild
wishes he hardly dared to frame.
Suddenly, far different sounds struck
on his ear: it was the servants of the
castle rejoicing at the marriage, and the
revelry of the domestics was a strange
omen, contrasted with the despair of the
son. .
. . .
Ah!" said Desmond; "there can

be but one motive for this union. They
intend to defraud or to injure Endymion :
they fear the secret will be betrayed by
her simplicity, and they are taking means
to secure it that bode no good to her.
Perhaps my presence may be some pro-
tection to her: I may defend her from
their schemes, or assist her to escape from
them."
And easily reconciled to any thought
that flattered him with the hope of re-
maining near her, he returned to the cas-
tle, determined to watch the artful mo-
ther of Endymion at the price both of
his pride and his feelings, but resolved
not to witness the disastrous gaiety of the
night. He lingered in the passage till
one of the servants passing shewed him.

scenery was not real. He dreamed he
was in an apartment of the castle where
Endymion was lying asleep : he had an
indefinite sensation, so common in sleep,
that he was compelled to watch her slum-
bers. Suddenly Lady Montclare entered :
she was followed by his father, who was
wrapped in a shroud, and whose face ex-
hibited the livid appearance of death.
They approached the bed where she lay,
and Desinond gazed with horror on his
father, whose dead and wasted hands held
a taper, and who appeared to follow
· Lady Montclare as a subservient spirit
does the steps of an enchantress.
They hung over Endymion for some
time, and then Lady Montclare, suddenly
drawing a dagger, attempted to plunge
it into her heart. Desmond springing
forward to save her, received the blow
in his own, and at that moment the floor
opening beneath his feet, disclosed a
vault into which the arms of Connal ex-

tended to draw him, and as he gazed
giddily down on the horrible depth, he
observed Armida lying on a corse below.
He shivered and awoke: the storm of
the night had passed away: the moon
shone faintly through the heavy casea'
ment. Desmond sat up and tried to
shake off the impression of his dream;
but in vain: the cold drops trembled on
his forehead still, and struggling in vain
with feelings which he condemned, but
could not resist, he rose and walked up
and down the room ; but every step he
took in the place where he received the
impressions seemed to confirm them, and
ashamed, tliough unable to overcome
them, he quitted the room and wandered
through the passages of the eastle. The
lights that burned in them were not yet
extinguished, and Desmond thought as
he entered that he beheld a white figure
gliding before him for a moment: the
steps gave no sound; there was no echo,

and at first he believed his senses, con-
fused by visionary terror, had deceived
him, till a faint moan, issuing through a
door in the passage, convinced him that
something living was near him. He
followed the sound, which grew more
audible every moment, and found it con-
ducted him to the chapel. He entered :
a single light burning on the ground
faintly shewed the altar : the window of
stained glass, emblazoned with the figures
of the Virgin and Saint Patrick, and in
the lower compartments with the arms
of the O'Morvens; and the vessel for
holy water that stood at the narrow
entrance of the sacristy : all the rest was
dark, except a partial gleam that fell on
the dusky canopy of the seat where the
O'Moryens received the rites of their
church, when possessors of the castle.
Desmond paused, and the recollection
that here the sex of Endymion had been
discovered by the old harper, in the con

ference between Lady Montclare and her
priest, struck on his imagination as if
this place was doomed to be favourable
to his bopeless passion. .
As he advanced he beheld a figure in
white clinging to the rails of the altar,
and so absorbed in devotion, that not a
movement betrayed its consciousness of
his approach, and but for a faint sound,
between a groan and a prayer, that it
uttered from time to time, it appeared
like a part of the altar it hung on.. Des-
mond was already beside it, before the
figure, raising her head, discovered the
features of Endymion, pale and wild with
superstition, grief, and passion. Des-
mond gazed on her with pity and horror:
her lips were white, and her limbs
shivered with cold.
" Good heaven ! Endymion, what has
brought you here-alone, at night, and
uttering these groads."
Endymion did not answer, but waved

him away with a stern expression in her
countenance. Desmond, believing this
was insanity, still urged his inquiries, till
Endymion, with terror in her looks,
said:
"I was doing penance."
“ Penance !” cried Desmond, snatch-
ing her from the cold pavement in his ..
arms. “What crime have you com-
mitted ? What can you have to atone
for?”
5 Ah !” said Endymion, reclining on
him, yet trying to avert her eyes from his
gloomy face; “are not my sensations at
this moment à crime?" . .
"And who has imposed this on you?”
cried Desmond. " What monster has
made you kneel almost naked on these
hard stones at midnight ?".
" It was Father Morosini.”
« And for what?”
* For thinking of you.”
:s For thinking of me?"

. “Yes. I cannot pray, I cannot do
penance, without incurring it again for
my wanderings: if I close my eyes to
shut out external objects, it is you I see:
if I kiss the picture of the Virgin, it is
your lip I seem to press. I sometimes
try to pour out my heart on the objects
of devotion, and to think I love the cru-
cifix, while I press it to my heart, but
it is only because the pressure reminds
me of the night you once held me to
your's. Ah, Desmond ! how shall I mur.
mur at the penance, when the very crime
is a pleasure ?"
« And do you then love me, Endy-
mion, love me so fondly? Confess it then
to ine alone, my little trembling darling,
and your penance shall be gentler. Don't
tell that rigid priest; he will make it a
crime, merely for the sake of punishing
it.”

one else would listen to me. They told
me it was impossible I could love you ;
but if it be not love, there is no naine for
the sensation I feel for you. I am sick
and wretched when you are present: I.
am like an insect in the sun, dying of too
much brightness, yet when you are gone,
I only live on the thought when I shall
see you again. When you approach me,
the same trembling, the same sickness of
the heart oppresses me; I have no wishes,
no thoughts, no words to express them;
I gaze on you till I am entranced: Feel,
Desmond, how my heart is throbbing."
"No, no, Endymion, it would only
bring another penance. Stand there, and
I will lean on the other side of the altar :
we cannot be too far from each other
while you tell me how you love me."
“ Ab! let me lean on you at least, and
hide my cheek in your breast: I never
can tell you how I love you, while your
eyes are fixed on me: love and devotion
both require the shade."

“ No, not a step nearer, or I am gone :
speak, and I will listen for ever: I may
be mad, but I will not be guilty. Do
you love me as you did, Endymion, that
night we were in the cave together?"
“Oh! yes, more, but I fear you
more: you used to drive me from you,
and tell me it was a crime for us to love
each other ; but since last night you are
no longer afraid to approach or speak
to me. There is a different expression in
your eyes when you look at me: your
voice has more softness in it, and you
caught me in your arms as closely as the
night you saved my life, and imagined I
was a woman. Ah! Desmond, come no
nearer me, I feel the fears you have
taught me: your words bind me like a
spell, though I know there is no danger
in being near you.”
“ 'Tis you have come nearer, Endy-
mion: you know not your danger. I
feel the railing tremble under your hand :
is it the cold that makes you tremble ?".

« Cold ! oh, no, I am burning."
* And so am I. And must we waste
away, thus gazing on each other, till life
is exhausted, without hope, without pos-
sibility of relief ?-die in each others
sight, die of each others looks ? Oh!
what perance can Morosini inflict like
this!"
“Oh! that he would impose no other,"
said the impassioned Endymion ; " that
we could linger here for ever, forgetting
how suns set and rose, till we forgot
every thing but each other. How often
have I wished that you were a statue,
that I might sit at your feet, and gaze
on you till I grew cold as stone myself.
Do you remember the story of the Italian,
who fell in love with a statue, and
viewed it in despair till she died. Ah!
let such a death be mine, for what is life
compared to it? But, alas ! I am not a
woman, and it would be a slame for a
boy to die of love."

" Then it would be a shame for a
man,” said Desmond, no longer repress-
ing his burning tears, “yet I believe
that shame must be mine."
“ Hush! hush!!' said Endymion, in a
voice of fear, “ I hear Father Morosini
coming.”.
" What does he come for at this hour?"
said Desmond.
.To see if I am performing the pe-
nance he enjoined.”
“And how long does he stay?”
- Oh! he often stays hours with me.”
“ Alone, at night?",
- Yes.”
“ And you so slightly clad ?”

Desmond, alarmed and incensed, yet
unable to explain bimself to Endymion,
was obliged to retire, for Morosini was
just approaching: he concealed himself
behind the door of the chapel, in hopes
of hearing their conference; and the im-
perfect sounds tortured his suspicious
impatience, till afraid of breaking in on
them if he continued to listen any longer,
he forced himself away.
He had just fallen into a slumber that
was soothing him with the iñage of En.
dymion, when a noise at his door awoke
him: he listened, and heard a sigh so
deep, that it seemed like a last effort for
respiration. No answer was made to his
inquiry who was there; the sigh was re-
peated, and at lengih he heard his name

He rose, but did not open his door.
“Endymion, is it possible you are
there?"
“Yes, I have been lying on the ground
·at your door this hour.”
« Oh! retire to your room, and try to
rest."
"I cannot sleep, and this is the only
rect I wish for."

mond, in a voice that announced the last

tenderness to me, and yet talk nothing
but of danger and fear? If I am guilty,
why do you say you love me; and if I
am not, why may I not approach you ?"
"I do not know why," said the racked
Desmond; “ neither heaven or nature
forbid it, and if you stay there I shall
not be able to forbid it longer.”
“ Oh! open the door for one moment:
let me but lean my head one moment on
your breast, my burning eyes would close
so sweetly, and I would dream the dreams
of heaven there.”
“ Impossible! impossible! your thoughts
are innocent, but to listen to them makes
me guilty."
"Ah!” said Endymion, sadly, " I have
been the child of mystery from my birth,
and every one round me deals only in
mystery: to-night you held me to your

getting all constraint, he threw open the
door, and sunk on the ground beside
her.

altered looks, though she could not un-
derstand their expression, “ Desmond !

“ And why can you not caress me like
a brother ?"
“ Because a woman cannot be my bro-
ther,” said Desmond, distractedly.
At these words Endymion started from
his arms, and with a scream of horror
few towards her own apartment; and
Desmond, terrified at the consequences
of his own imprudence, pursuing her,
kneeled at her door, and supplicated in
his turn for admission in vain.
No answer was given, but as he leaned
against the door that was but slightly
elosed, it gave way, and by the lights
that still burned within, he beheld En-
dymion, pale and breathless, stretched on
the floor. He rushed, in, raised her in
his arms, bore her to a seat, and looked
* round for something to revive her, dread-
ing either to leave her, or call for as-
sistance.

horror of the disturbance he had caused
in this young, unconscious heart, that had
sought to subdue its struggles by religion.

round her without perceiving him, as he
stood trembling at a distance; but the

anguish, “ tell me the meaning of this
mysterious silence. What have I done?
Speak to me, even if you bid me quit
you for ever.” -

choaked and hollow voice: .
" It is not love, but death that fills my,

doom."
« I pronounced your doom !”
" Yes, I have heard my mother say to
Morosini, when she did not think I heard
them, “Should she ever learn she is a
woman, she must live no longer.”
Desmond listened speechless with horror.
“I knew not what she meant," con-
tinued the unfortunate girl, after a long
pause: “ I do not even understand what
you have told me, but the horror I feel
at my heart tells me I shall not survive
this night.”
“ Yes, you shall, angel! victim !"
cried Desmond, wild with grief and pas-
sion; “ you shall live, in spite of their
wickedness: their crimes have driven us
almost to madness, but they dare not me-
nace you with death.?. i .

· But Endymion no longer listened to
him: the eloquence of tenderness, the
energy of hope with which he tried to
sooth or to inspire her were in vain : the
impression was not to be effaced : and
kneeling before her crucifix, she implored
him with such solemnity not to disturb
her in the last offices of religion, that
Desmond was silenced.
His blood ran cold when he saw the
whiteness of her moving but silent lips,
the trembling of her locked hands, and
the breathless and supernatural abstrac-,
tion with which she listened to his sup-
plicating agony, and he was forced to
leave her, dreading that even this in-
pression, visionary as it was, might ve-
rify itself in the dissolution of her weak
and agitated frame.
It was late in the following day when
Desmond joined the family. He recalled
the events of the preceding night, and

mix with them, and if possible discover
the intentions of Lady Montclare towards
her daughter:
There were no guests at the castle :-
nothing announced the festivity of a re-
cent marriage ; and Desmond would have
found the silence and gloom around him
congenial to his feelings, but he was dis.
gusted by the overstrained courtesy of
Lady Montclare; and alarmed by the
obvious dejection of his father since his
arrival at the castle, his mind had been
so agitated, that he never made an in-
quiry after the absent members of the
family.
Connal he believed to be still in Dub.
lin, and Armida and Wandesford in
England. The servants from respect,
and his father from indifference, never
mentioned either their names or situa-
tions, and thus he remained in the castle,
as in Dublin,' utterly ignorant of the
events that had taken place in his absence.

volving the danger that threatened En-

terrors under which he had seen her sink-

startled by a figure flying towards him
with the speed of wind-it was Endy-

hung panting there, unable to hear his
repeated inquiries into the cause of her
agitation.

length, and repeated these words in a
voice hoarse with horror, till convulsed
she could repeat them no longer,

“and will you give me up to Morosini?”.
Her utter ignorance made her believe
that the means of existence were as easy
beyond the walls of the castle as within it.
Desmond, carried beyond himself by
this appeal, caught her in his arms, and
hurried along the terrace.
" Where are you taking me?" said
Endymion, who was now terrified at:
every movement.

every word she uttered, paused when he

“ Beyond the shadow of those walls I
have not a relation on earth.”
“Oh, that you had left me in igno.

should have trusted my life to you ; but
as a woman I tremble in solitude with
you."
Desmond, still kneeling at her feet,
soothed her with the humblest language
of respectful devotion..
As she viewed the scenery round her-

glittered in it, the endless expansion of

ethereal space that conveyed at once to
the soul the idea of its dignity and its
creator, she said mentally :--
- It is impossible that a heart capable
of love can admit a guilty thought in such
a night as this."
The emergency gave her a resolution
of which her natural character was des-
titute, and she extended her hand to
Desmond with an action that would have
disarmed treachery itself of dissimulation,
and taught confidence even to a hostile
savage.
Desmond accepted the precious pledge
with the purity of devotion.
At that moment the house of St, Aus-
tin, the uncle of Rosine, occurred to his
recollection, as affording the only asylum
to which he could conduct Endymion
with safety. I

that night; the misfortunes of Connal

thoughts, and they had sat together till
each was almost afraid of mentioning to
the other the ominous apprehensions with
which their minds were filled for the issue
of their disastrous fortunes and pas-
sions, .
On a sudden a loud knocking was
heard at the door.
• St. Austin, dreading the approach of
the rebels, had started up, when Des
mood entered, with Endymion, pale,
exhausted, and almost fainting in his
arms.
Resigning her to the care of Rosine,
he desired a short conference with St.
Austin
As well as his distraction would suffer
him to articulate, he described the si-
tuation and the danger of Endymion,
exposed to the arts of her mother, and
the unhallowed passion of Morosini.
" And where do you mean to place
her?” said St. Austin, who had long

suspected the secret of Endymion's
sex.
- Unite me to her this night,” said
Desmond, "and I shall then have a legal
right to protect her from danger, and
from insult.”
- You have anticipated my wish,” said
St. Austin : “ I have already thought of
a retreat for you ; but I did not dare to
mention it till I understood your inten-
tion towards this persecuted victim,
whom the vices of those wbo.should have
protected her have driven for shelter into
the armas of a stranger.”
'Desmond, though he blushed with in-
dignation at the name of Endymion being
united with suspicion of wrong from him,
suppressed his feelings, and again im-
plored St. Austin to give him a legal
right to afford that protection which her
natural relatives had denied her. .
St. Austin, aware of the danger to

each other's arms and into solitude, con-
sented to unite them, though he foresaw
many evils from such an abrupt and pre-
mature marriage.
They then returned to the room where
the females were.
The supplications of Desmond, and the
advice of St. Austin, soon subdued the
timid Endymion, and trembling and
blushing at the name of a state of whose
duties and claims she was as ignorant as
a child, she gave her hand to Desmond,
still in her masculine dress; and their
midnight union was witnessed only by
Rosine and her uncle.
As Rosine gazed on the animated fond
ness of Desmond, and the shrinking and
timid softness of Endymion, as she
saw their youthful figures - bend to re-

the sentiment of devotion, and the solem-
nity of an indissoluble engagement, she
thought with anguish on the different fate
of Connal and Armida, compared to whom
Desmond and his young bride already
seemed to have reached security and hap-
piness,
The next morning St. Austin disclosed
to Desmond the retreat which he de
signed.
About a mile from his house, the bank
of the river that flowed past it was bol-
lowed into a rocky recess, where the thick
foliage of the trees and shrubs that bung
over it .completely concealed a cottage
placed in its very bosom.
It had been inhabited by a bermit,
whose simplicity and piety often induced
St. Austin to visit him. Fond of his so-
litude, and not ostentatious of his sanctity,
he was little known by the country-
people, and but for St. Austin would

Tetreat.
He bad expired about a week before,
and was interred near his retreat, which
had remained untenanted since ; and
bere St. Austin counselled Desmond to
retire with Endymion, till the intentions
of Lady Montclare were discovered.
With food it was easy for St, Austin
to supply them; and there was no danger
of discovery while be and Rosine alone
were conscious of their retreat.
Here they remained buried in passion
and solitude,
“ The world forgetting, by the world forgot.”
Their beautiful figures were sometimes
seen by twilight on the rock that over-
shadowed their habitation, for they never
ventured out by day:
The neighbouring fishermen believed
them blessed spirits hovering over the
hermit's grave, and crossed themselves as
they rowed their boats near his retreat.

WHEN Connal returned to the isles
he was struck with grief and horror at
the state in which he found his fol-
lowers.
- He had left them a few brave men,
generously penitent for their crime, and
anxious to merit the mercy of govern-
ment: he found them, on his return, a
numerous and ferocious band, mutinous
to their leader, hostile to government,
and formidable to the country.
The daring spirit of Brunnan during
his absence had led them into every excess
of violence.
The discipline that Connal had esta-
blished was destroyed : instead of con-
fining themselves to the islands, they had
spread themselves along the shore, exer-

cising every outrage and aggression of
the inhabitants ; and, from the indiscrie
minate admission of every vagabond and
profligate into the ranks, their numbers
had increased beyond all power of con-
trol, and the spirit of humanity, and ho-
mour, that Connal had tried to inspire
them with, was utterly extinguished. It
was in vain that he attempted to restrain
their excesses, and restore the discipline
they had thrown off: in vain he puoished

part of the country to march against
them, and Wandesford, who had been re-
cruiting his regiment during the summer',
was to command the forces.
Trembling for the fate of Armida, and
hopeless of his own, Connal was compelled
to exert all his resolution to conceal from
her the danger he could not but see. He
in vain looked round his desperate band
for one firm and faithful arm to whom he
might entrust her in the hour of danger;
and, no longer looking to life for hope,
he almost limited his agonized prayers
to her safety alone. One day that
the rebels had surprised a detachment
that was marching along the coast,
the conduct by which Coppal had ex-
tricated them from the perilous defile
where they were exposed to the fire of the
musketry, and the courage with which
he had braved it till the last man had
quitted the glen, extorted a shout of ac-
clamation from the most mutinous of the

life.. .
Connal seized this moment, while
bleeding with wounds he bore for them,
to implore their mercy for the few
survivors, who had flown for shelter to a
bog at some distance, and stood there in
expectation of their fate..
The rebels, in the impulse of the mo-
ment, promised they would not molest
them; but Connal had scarcely reached
his tent, when, by the horrid yell that
struck his ear, he knew the work of blood
was begun.
He rushed out with his wounds un..
bound, and beheld these few unfortunate
men pursued over the heath by the rebels
with every instrument of destruction their
fury could seize.
Connal called, he commanded, he ad-
jured them to spare a few unarmed and
wounded wretches: he would have in-

terposed his own breast to defend them ;
but their pursuers were between them
and him.
Sick with horror at the sight, and faint
with his neglected wounds, he-threw him- -
self on the ground, and cursed the hour
he became their leader. . ,
At that moment the yell was renewed.
Starting up, he beheld at some distance
a young officer, flying like the wind, and
thirteen or fourteen rebels, like wolves
after their prey, pursuing him with pikes
and scythes, 'not so much to kill as to
mangle and tear. .
Frantic at their barbarity, Connal
seized a musket from one of the men
near him, and loading it, fired among
them.
They turned, believing that the fugi-
tives had rallied on them; but the officer,
after staggering a few steps further,

Connal instantly flew to his assist-
ance.
As he passed the heath like lightning,
the old harper, who was sitting on the
ground, and who knew his step, called to
him to save the unfortunate young man.
“ He cried to me to shoot him as he
flew past," said he : "it was not death he
feared, but to be torn to pieces alive with
the claws of those cannibals,
“ 'Oh! there will be a curse on such
doings, and on all concerned in them."
Connal did not wait to hear him: in
a moment he was kneeling on the ground
beside the victim.
His clothes had been almost torn off in
his flight; his bare bosom was streaming
with blood; his long, light hair steeped
in it, stained the ground on which it fell
scattered and soiled. His arm was over
his face: Connal removed it.
Speechless and frozen at the sight, he

remained gazing on it, while the sufferer
lay bleeding almost to death.
He had no words, no tears; but he
gazed fearfully round the men, who by
this time surrounded him, as if to disco-
ver who had done this deed.
At last he murmured " The stranger
said we might meet in the field, and is it
thus we have met at last: oh! Des-
mond! Desmond! my brother ! my bro-
ther !”
A burst of agony shook his frame, aod
he fell prostrate on the bloody breast of
Desmond.
The rebels, with a murmur of compas-
sion, raised the brothers, and bore them
both senseless to Connal's tent.
One of them, who had attained some
knowledge of surgery, examined Des.
mond's wounds : none of them were mor-
tal, though, from the loss of blood, he
long continued senseless, and even when
he revived, was unable to speak. '

The moment Connal's senses return-
ed, he flew to his brother's bed, and feel-
ing an unconquerable horror at seeing
him in the hands of his murderers, had
him removed, exhausted as he was, to
the retreat where he had concealed Ar.
mida..
He walked beside him as they bore him
along, bathing with tears the damp hand
that could no longer return the pressure
of bis; and at that moment his suffer-
ings might, before a tribunal of inquisi-
tors, be allowed to have expiated his of-
fences.
That night, when he reached Armida's
cottage, accustomed as she was lately to
see him exhausted by fatigue and emo-
tion, the agitation and horror of bis coun-
tenance struck her, and she felt, for the
first time, that passion itself was unequal
in resources of relief to the vicissitudes of
a life so various and so agitated.

Seating himself at a distance, he drew
his thick hair over his eyes, and clasped
his hands over his forehead, while Ar-
mida with anguish saw the tears burst-
ing through them.

failed to reconcile him to himself this

and shame around me : the very earth is
sick of my weight, and I linger on it
only to meet some punishment that will
make its inhabitants tremble.” .
Armida, scărce recovered from her
recent terrors, exerted all her powers to
sooth his tortured sensibility ::

misfortunes, and reminded him of the hu.

use of unlawful power, and conciliated
even his enemies.
Ah !” said Connal, “ I thought my.
self moderate before I possessed power';
but who can trust his heart ? --and is it
not the heart that heaven regards and
punishes for its wanderings ?
“ Did I never feel the swell of pride
while marching at the head of hundreds
devoted to my will? Did I never, in the
thought of obtaining a victory, forget
the sacrifice of lives it must cost ? Did
I never in the moment,of triumph forget
how father wept for child, and brother
for brother, as I do now?".
• Armida struggled in vain to support
the sinking spirits that had so often sus-
tained her's.
Ah! no," said Connal in unutterable

man, and all'that cling to me must fall with
me. I am a falling rock; and the very

“Ah! my love,” cried Armida, “it is
in your hour of distress that I proudly
claim my right to suffer with you : the
former energies of my mind are concen-
tred into one powerful sentiment, to
which life or death now appear equal.
It is not in the summer of life, when every
object is green and verdant, that passion
loves to gaze on its object; ah! po; it is
when life is chequered with misfortune,

him, and its dissolution murmurs in every

Connal, subdued by her tenderness,
forgot the sentiment of grief that inspired
and mingled with it, and while he knelt
at her feet, and held her soft hand to his
throbbing forehead and bosom, their pulsa-
tion became calmer, and in her presence he
almost ceased to believe himself guilty,
for he felt he was no longer unhappy.
..Desmond's recovery was slow, and
(his safety was ascertained long before his
reason was restored. .
Çonnal, who had watched him every
day while he remained in a state of in-
sensibility, hid himself from his sight
from the moment he could recognize ob-
jects. He could not bear to appear before
him in his present degradation, and he
felt the superiority of Desmond's situa-
tion, stretched on the bed of death, where
honourable wounds had laid him, to his
own at the head of a rebel host.
As the time for bis departure at length
approached, Connal, though resolved to

to sooth the yearnings of his heart by
the sound of his brother's voice.;
Desmond was conducted at night to
the shores of the isle, and desired to re-
main there till his guides returned.
There was neither moon nor star.

heard the surges break at his feet; but
he could distinguish no object, nor con-
jecture for what purpose he had been
brought there,
Suddenly a tall figure, closely muffled,
stood beside him.
.“ Young man,” said he, in a disguised

is on the shore to conduct you from these
isles.
“ I trust you have not wanted care
during your abode with us.”
“I thank you,” said Desmond; “ but
I am determined not to quit this till I
have seen my brother."

“ Impossible !" said the stranger;
“ your brother could not encounter your
sight.”
"I know him better than you,” said
Desmond; “ I know my sight would do
him good. Though the fiercest of his
men were about him, he would give me
one look, and the thoughts of his youth
would visit his heart again.”
“ Perhaps he dreads your sight,”
said the stranger : " he fears your re-
proaches."
“He fears nothing,” said Desmond :
“ he never feared. Who shall reproach
him ? His offence was involuntary :
-Connal must be the sufferer, but Wan-
desford was the criminal."
.“ We will leave his public character
he is not of your opinion, perhaps," said
the stranger : " but can you forgive your
own injuries and sufferings ? - Can you
forget it was the crime of your brother

with the fangs of bis banditti yet reeking
from your flesh, can you forgive him ?”
“For one of that banditti you speak
strangely,” said Desmond.
"I am indeed one of them,” said the
stranger, " and must be involved in their
punishment, but I have kept aloof from
their crimes.”
“I would you were all as sure of hea-
ven’s forgiveness as of mine," said Des-
mond. " How can I feel I am near
those shores without a heart burning with
affection? There is not a stone on them
that is not a memorial of his more than
fraternal, his parental love and care for
me; and the sea that beats on them shall
wash them away before their traces leave
my heart." .

man,” said the stranger, "are you sure
that no stirring of resentment, no opposi-
tion of sentiments, no anger at his fall, i
would disturb your meeting ?"

me this moment: bring me to his pre-
sence.”

Desmond, the life of a rebel will not af-

When their emotion had subsided,
Connal conducted him to Armida ; and
anxious if possible to detain him a little
longer in their retreat, he went out in
quest of the old harper.
“ Cormac," said he, “ are the men ap-
prised that my brother is in Wandesford's
regiment ? Do you think he would be
safe in remaining here a day?"
The old man confessed there were loud
murmurs against Connal for preserving the
life of one of Wandesford's officers, against
whom their resentment was implacable.
"And what did you say when you
heard them?” said Connal.
Cormac repeated the common to-
pics by which he had tried to appease

“Ah!” said Connal, impatiently, “ you
do not speak as if you were pleading for
a brother: his safety must not be trusted
with you.”

Armida when she first beheld Des.

tune and habitual danger had struggled
with but not subdued the proud con-
sciousness that once marked her expres-
sion: even yet she seemed not « less than

he saw her, wept. .
They passed all that night in melan- :

soon a fiend broke into it.
" One lovely summer's evening, we
had lingered late on the bank of the river,
watching the birds dipping into the
bright wave. Ines ( for she had assumed
the name by which she remembered being
called in infancy) compared them, as
their white wings gleamed in the sun,
to spirits on their dismission from the
body, hovering over the water of life in
Elysium.
“Long security had left us without fear,
and she sung for me one of those songs
which I heard on our passage from Italy
before I saw her, and never forgot the
impression they conveyed—that it was a
woman or an angel that sung.

boat approaching: Ines grew pale, and,
falling into my arms, said she saw the

quit her to go to St. Austin for assist-
ance. Overpowered with terror, she lay
down ; I continued to sit up: there was
not the slightest noise, not a breeze past
the casement; and the river, how still
and calm it was that night. It was long
past midnight, when as I was sitting
beside Ines, who had fallen asleep, I
observed the light of the moon as it
shone in at the window was obscured:
I looked up, and the face of a man ap-
peared through it. What were my feel-
ings at that moment ! I could not leave
Ines even for a moment to discover our
danger : but I was not long left doubt-
ful of it. The door was burst open,
and Morosini with two others rushed in :
I heard him say:

her away.'
"In mere despair I struggled with
them, and had got one of them to the
ground, when Ines, who awoke with the
noise, and saw Morosini by the light of
the moon, frantic at his sight, rushed
out of the cottage : he pursued her. I
had by this time overcome the other
aruffian, and followed her too: in frenzy
she flew up the rock; she saw him close
behind her : she plunged into the river
and perished : before my eyes she sunk,
and with her my unborn babe,"
He stopt, and for a long time no sound
was heard but his convulsive sobs, and
the audible grief of Armida and Connal,
At length raising his head, and fixing
his eyes on his brother, he said with
desperate calmness :- .
" Yes, I lost her, and I came here to
meet my death from your hand, Con-

Connal, unable to answer him, wayed
his hand for him to cease.
"I have no recollection of what fol-
lowed that moment,” said Desmond: “I
believe I was deranged: to St. Austin I
owe my life: had he known to what he
was restoring me, in humanity he would
have let me perish. No trace of her ever
was discovered. The body of Morosini,
who must have perished in the attempt
to save her, was aſterwards found :

away, gazing on the water that flowed
over her, till by accident I heard what
the deep solitude we lived in had con-
cealed from me."
Again he stopt : Connal bid his face :
he knew his meaning well.
" The first moment I heard it,” cried
Desmond, with a flash of his native im-
petuosity, “ I thought I could have
stabbed you to the heart: the shock, the
overthrow of all my proud thoughts, my
devoted veneration, my ambitious affec-
tion for you, was too much for me. I
flew to join the regiment, and Wandes
ford, I believe, was gratified by the
thought of seeing us armed against each
other, for instead of bringing me before
a court-martial for my desertion of duty, .
he employed me in the detachment among
whom I suffered. But I felt while
marching I was a coward; I dreaded
not death, but the sight of you, Connal.

hand but by your look."

effect of this language on, Armida,
beckoned his brother to follow him; and
they quitted the cottage together. They
wandered on the shore for some time in
silence. Connal's heart was too full for
words: at length he seemed to dismiss
with one heavy sigh the weight that
hung on it.

victory is almost hopeless, and even
victory must be at length succeeded by
defeat. We are too few to subdue a
country; we are too numerous to escape
from it: neither resistance nor submission
can avail us: we may fall slowly, we
may fall bravely, but fall we must : yet
at this hour, urged to extremity as I am,
beyond all resolution to cope with,
almost beyond patience, there is but one
chord of my heart that is sensible to fear :
you know the pame that awakes it; I
cannot utter it: save her, Desmond; lead
her from this scene of blood ; place her in
safety; and I think I can then kneel
down and thank heaven with an unbur-
thened heart, though its last drop was to
flow the next moment."
Desmond listened, but his heart, chilled
and withered by calamity, had no room
for that glowing sympathy, that trem-
bling ardour of benevolence that was its
fruit in more genial hours. He promised

to conduct Armida from the approaching
conflict, but he declared his resolution
to return and perish, if they were to
perish, with his brother. Conpal's heart
swelled with agony; he would have
spoken, but his voice was choaked; and
turning his head aside, he wiped away
the tears that love, grief, and remorse,
made alternately sweet and bitter.
“Connal,” said Desmond,“ more than
the eloquence of man is in those tears,"
but their eloquence is in vain : what
have I to do with life : bappiness is gone
with her who gave it, and honour is not
for the brother of a rebel. Were I even
restored to what I was, what would it
avail: my notions of right and wrong
are lost: the principles you taught me
your own example has defeated: the
world seems changed since I heard
that Connal was a rebel. I can neither
do good nor receive it from any one: no
one loves me, nor do I delight to love.

before you in fight, and receive some

the use I can be now, and if this be
denied me, I care not if I run on the
pike of one of your band before your
sight; it will give that relief to a
wretch which a brother refuses.”.
A melancholy struggle of generous
feeling followed between these unfor.
tunate young men, but Desmond, obsti.

persisted and prevailed. They then
separated, Desmond to prepare Armida
for Connal's determimation, and Connal

strengthened : the ferocious courage
that had supported the band failed on
the approach of real danger. About noon
the rebel out-posts on the shore were
driven in, and they could see their friends
iying in all directions. Connal, though
they were in no immediate danger, then
thought it high time to move to their
relief; and the shore, obscured by the
smoke of the musketry, favouring their
expedition, they embarked to save if
possible the fugitives whose temerity had
prevented their seeking shelter in the
isles before the arrival of the military:
but the shore, covered with soldiers, defied
their approach, and the wretched rebels,
driven at the point of the bayonet, were ,
struggling for life in the waves. Connal
in vain encouraged his men to row for-
ward and save, their perishing com-
panions : they shrunk back, till he and

drowning wretches from destruction. A
few were then incited by their example,
and during the whole of that dreadful
day Connal toiled among the foremost,
through waves dyed with blwod and
strewn with corses, till the soldiers, weary
of unresisted slaughter, retired from the
shore. In the evening, some who had
concealed themselves among the rocks
escaped to the isles, where the next day
they purposed to invade them, and ex. ,.
terminate their inhabitants.
Connal, unable to snatch a moment's
repose, passed the night in making pre-
paration for the last resistance, dismissed
Desmond to Armida's retreat, which in
this hour, that demanded all the energies
of his heart, he dared not visit himself,
and two hours after midnight retired to
his tent alone. During this last interval of
solitude, he attempted to commit his
thoughts to writing

The morning was grey and misty, and
the heavy vapours that hung over the
shore and the isles, mixing with the smoke
of artillery, soon concealed every object
under a volume of darkness.
Armida, though she rejected the
thought of leaving Connal with a decision
that left no room for importunity or ar-
gument, had consented to take shelter in
the isle that he had collected the largest
body of the insurgents in, and conceived
the least accessible from the shore.

passed the whole of that dreadful day.
No messenger arrived, no report reached
them; at times, unable to bear the op-
pression of her heart, she quitted the
cottage, and ascending the rock, tried to
gaze round her.
All was mist and gloom; no objeet
could be seen but the rolling volumes of
smoke, sometimes broken by a sudden
flash: no sound could be heard but the
roar of artillery, ceaseless, deep, and
deafening. She had passed the night
without sleep, and the day without food,
and the stupor that now invaded all her
faculties seemed like the approach of
peace.
Sinking on the ground, and hiding her
face with her hands, she resigned the
attempt even to think any further, and
the prayers that would have burst from her
heart she had no longer strength to utter.
Evening approached : a bright autum-
nal moon broke through the vapours that

wished for darkness again.
It was now night, and nothing had
broke the fearful silence all day, when
steps were heard on the rock, and four of
the rebels were seen by the light of the
moon running towards the cottage, with
their pikes dyed in blood up to the hand.
Armida started from the ground, but she
could not speak : their tale was soon told:
the king's troops had effected a landing
in the isle about noon, though desperately
opposed by the rebels, and had, after
a dreadful slaughter, nearly reached the

where the troops were forcing their way.

isle: here stood the ruins which Armida

it well, but her parched and burning eyes
had not now a tear to give to memory or
to passion.
They entered the ruins, and the men

the military approaching. She listened,
and then exerting her utmost strength to
speak, implored them to return to Con

orders not to quit her sight, and reluc-
tant as they were to obey them, she could
not prevail on them to leave her.
It was almost midnight, but the con-
flict had not ceased, and so totally unlike
to modern war, that it seemed like the
contest of iwo savage nations in their
deserts : there was no array, no regularity,

treat. Except where Condal still main-
tained his bloody post near the centre of
the isle, the rebels were everywhere
broken, and the soldiers pursuing them
in detached parties. Every cliff, every
glen was the scene of a different
action; it was the fight of man with
man, the thrust of pike and bayonet
hand to hand, the discharge of musket

and pistol at 'the very breast of thre
assailant; and this desultory conflict,
that extended to every retreat in the isle,
and tore all its echoes with the yell of
assault, and the groan of death, was more
terrible to the fugitives than one decisive
and stationary action.
At first it was rather a rout than an
engagement, rather a slaughter than a
victory, but as the night advanced, the
superior knowledge and activity of the
rebels in their wild recesses, and the con-
tempt of the military for these fugitive
savages, was fatal to multitudes of the
former, who pursued their victory too
far; and before midnight, though the
soldiers claimed the victory, the loss had
been nearly equal.
It was two hours since Armida and her
attendant, seated on a tomb-stone that
rose in the centre of what had once been
the aisle of a monastery, listened in vain
for a sound of hope or safety.

The men at length leaving her, paced
gloomily along the ruined cloisters, strik-
ing their pikes against the broken pave-

woman, worn out by fatigue and horror,
fell asleep at her feet.

moment: the moon was bright in heaven,
the grey ruins were tinged with her' full
but solemn light : there was not a cloud
in ether; the breeze scarce waved the
foliage that wreathed the shattered walls,
and this breathless stillness of nature,
contrasting the passions of man, made
them seem more formidable. She could
scarce believe that amid such scenes fury
could be felt, or blood could be shed by
man.
She was startled from her reverie by
the sound of voices and steps approach-
ing: she recognized the English accent
of the soldier's of Wandesford's regi-
ment--they advanced-they would have

passed on, but the rebels observing the
fewness of their numbers, in their zeal
for vengeance betrayed the charge com-
mitted to them, and pursued them in-
stantly.
A sharp contest followed, and the re-
bels, three of them wounded, retreated to
the ruin : the soldiers pursued them, and
in a moment Armida saw their bayonets
sparkling, and the fire flashing before
her eyes. Her terror had not deprived
her of recollection, and she attempted to
take shelter in the vaults, but her com-
panion, delirious with fear, clung to her
with such force that it was impossible to
escape, and they sunk on the ground
together. - .
The unfortunate men, whose rashness
had betrayed her, now exerted the last
remains of life to gather round her, and
defend her from the soldiers. Three of

Horror overcame all her faculties, and
for a few moments she remained insen-
sible ; but the flash and the confliot so
near her allowed her but a short respite,
and when she recovered, she saw another
arm raised in her defence, whose force
could not be mistaken. It was Connal,
desperately encountering thesoldiers alone,
and in this tremendous struggle his morc
than human figure gave a kind of dignity
even to slaughter. ,
The soldiers had expended their ball,
and all whom he had not disabled pressed
on him with their bayonets. He had no :
weapon but the pike of one of the fallen
rebels, and with this in his hand, his
back to the tomb where Armida had
fallen, and bis foot planted against a
fragment of stone, it seemed easier to lift
the building from its base than to make
him yield an inch.

human being could support such a con-
test : but a few moments brought the
dreadful conviction that he could not
sustain it long : she heard his broken
respiration ; she felt him stagger ; the
ground trembled with his convulsive
movements"; the tomb was stained with his
blood, and the force of the blows made it
flow fast on Armida as she lay almost at
his feet, alive only to the horrible idea
of seeing him die before her: sbe called
she shrieked to the soldiers to spare his
life, and promised all her wealth to re-
ward them.,
Connal cast a look of agouy on her,
but he had not breath to utter a word ;
desperate with terror, she fell on her
knees, and offered to throw herself on
their mercy, if they would spare him.

The men, ineensed by Connal's despe-
rate resistance, and determined on his
life, closed round their victim..
Armida, driven to frenzy, looked round
for a weapon to defend his life or end
her own, and at that moment could she
have wielded a pike her desperation
would have driven it into the breast of

the wild yell of the rebels struck her ear;
she echoed it in voluntarily with a cry as

almost fatally for himself had left far
behind Aying to her assistance, poured
in to his rescue, and Connal, who had
exhausted his utmost force in the last
blow he had aimed, fell into the arms of
the first who advanced to defend him.

moment, but who seemed alive only to
the fate of one man, after lingering for
some time, gazing and doubtful of their

Armida's senses wandered ; sight and
hearing failed her, though her recollection
remained, and she seemed to struggle
through mist and darkness for a clear
perception of her danger. With an effort
that suffering alone can make, she raised
herself, and threw back her dishevelled
hair to look round her: Connal, pale,
bloody, and exhausted, was kneeling be-
fore her.
“ You are safe, you are alive,” he
cried, but not in a voice of tenderness or
joy: “ now let me begone."
Armida, unable to speak, attempted to
hold him; he broke from her, but the
speechless agony of her look made him
pause.

All Armida's sufferings were nothing
compared to the bitterness of this mo-
ment, when, for the first time, Connal's
lips reproached ber; but her fear over-
came every other feeling, and she still
clung to him, though she did not dare

my name from the book of life of the

Armida, unable to bear the intolerable

agony of his heart and frame, released her
hold, but as he rushed from her, she
called to him to kill her before he
went.

you-I am not fit to defend you : 'till I
have recovered the post I deserted I am
unworthy to draw a 'swordman infant or

was below, whose voice they thought they
knew, but who refused to enter unless I
admitted him: this appeal removed my

they had seen lights burning. I followed

she was. The whole day they had been

they landed in the evening, they concealed
themselves among the rocks, till night-

an energy in her figure, a character in
her expression, and even a glow on her
cheek at times brighter than the tint of
youth, or health, or happiness. I look
with terror on that dazzling and fright-
ful beauty that derives its lustre from
passions too powerful for the frame, and
almost makes you see the spirit shining
through its fragile and transparent
vesture. Her mind is more changed
than her figure; she has no ambition, no
imagination left; she talks calmly of

that await her, but she never speaks of

that name had given her. Alas! what

“ I have been making inquiries: dread-

Connal : I know not what his present plans
are, whether to retain possession of the
islands, or to break through the forces
stationed on the shore, and regain the
mountains, or disperse themselves through
the country. The emigration of such a
number to America is almost impossible,
and it is equally so that they can remain
in safety here: in either case, her absence
will leave every power unimpeded, but I
fear their utmost exertion will never be

not how he escaped or recovered. He
has wandered about since, not to seek
safety, for he wished to die, but he wished..

Desmond is certain he did not perish in

that dreadful day he was still fighting.

alive, and his body has not yet been

How terrible is this contrasted union of
early youth with a broken heart. Even
Connal and Armida, tempest-shaken as
they are, scarce present such a melan-
choly image as this young green branch
withered in its vernal prime. Desmond,
you are worthy of such a brother, but
you were worthy of a better fate. In
early youth, I already seem to myself to
have lived too long to witness what I have
done. Misfortunes antedate experience,
and existence protracted for ever could
hardly sustain such a loss again as it has
done in Connal and Desmond : how much
virtue and valour bas perished with
them ! what genius and passion in Ar-
mida! what softness and innocence in Ines!
I feel them as already lost; and the storm
that is now howling through the sky
seems to me as if it were passing over their
graves. Alone, at midnight, the past full
of misfortune, and the future of terror,

On the dreadful evening of the en-
gagement Connal was left alone on the
heath. He looked round him: a few of
the rebels still were seen on the dim verge
of the heath, as if they were fiying to
hide themselves in the shades of the night. ·
The sudden change from the tumult of
fight to silence, solitude, and darkness,
was terrible, and for a moment he stood
spell-bound and unconscious of existence
on the spot. He called on his men : his
voice was echoed from the hills, but no
one answered.
" Desmond ! Desmond !” he cried ;
but Desuiond was lying in a glen far dis-
tant, wounded and weltering in blood.
A thrill of anguish mixed with pride
darted its last imnulse through Connal's
breast, and he exclaimed aloud:

" Is there not one brave man left, who
will plant his foot by mine, and perish by
my side?" No voice answered, no foot
approached. Connal, threw down his
sword on the heath. - All is lost !” broke
from his lips : and the winds that whis-
tled on the heath seemed to murmur back
the sound-"All is lost !"
" Yet, yet there is one to be saved,"
he exclaimed, as the thought of the poor
old maniac in his cell rushed on his mind.
He retired from the field but slowly,
for he expected to meet an enemy at every
step. The heath was deserted, and he
entered the rocky path that led to the
glen where his grandfather was confined.
On his entrance to it he started to avoid
treading on a body that lay before his
feet. He advanced again, and beheld a
number scattered along the path: a party
of rebels had contested that pass in the
morning, and every man had fallen where
he fought. “ And these all perished for
me!” said Connal, pausing.

Impelled by horror he sprung through
this glen of death, and descended through
the chasm that opened on the shore: all
was dark, cold, and solitary. The echo
of his step was the only sound, as he
crossed the valley: it seemed like the
warrior's grave, when the warrior's strug-
gle was past. ,
As he hurried on with a beating heart,
the roar of the ocean burst on his ear,
and the wind rushing through this nar-
row pass seemed to swell to a storm the
accents of horror and death he had lately
heard rose on the gale, as if the spirits
of those that had fallen were ascending
on its wings in their flight to eternity :
he stopped, and looked upward: the
rocks were darkening above, and the
ocean bursting at his feet-nature, as
well as man, seemed arming against him.
His mind, pressed with many cares and
sufferings, began to fail, and he imagined
that the spirits of those he had loved and.
destroyed hung on the clouds that black-

ened over his head. Desmond reproached
him with his blasted hopes, and Armida
reminded him of the extinguished lustre
of her destiny, her talents, aud her pas-
sion. He listened to these sounds of fan-
cy, till, almost maddening with their ter-
ror, he turned with flashing eye, and dis-
hevelled hair, to answer them. The wind
sunk: he paused, and heard only the throb..
bing of his heart. Ashamed of his weak-
ness, yet shrinking from its recurrence, he.
hurried to the habitation of the maniac. :
His retreat was so secluded that no
one, even in that day of rayage, had
reached it; and Connal embarking with
him, and one wounded rebel, who had
sought shelter in the hut in an open boat,
exerted the last remains of his strength
to row to the shore before the soldiers
quitted the island, and overspread it,
He reached it before morning, and they
gained the summit of a rock, where they

Connal, who had carried his grand-
father in his arms up this almost inaccessi-
ble steep, sunk exhausted on the ground on
which he laid his helpless burden; and
their companion, who had dragged his
.: wounded limbs after them, died at their
; feet the moment he surmounted the accli-
"vity. Even Connal's faculties and frame
sunk for a time under his toil, and he fell
into a sleep, whose stupefaction resembled
that of death, till roused by the firing of
the soldiers, who had landed on the coast,
and were pursuing a few wretches who
had escaped from the islands, he started
up, and looked round for some cave to
bide in for the day.
Evening came on: no step of friend or
enemy approached. A cold sleet, drift-
ing with a stormy wind, beat into the
nook where they had shrunk : the bare
stone supported the emaciated limbs of
the maniac. Connal had in vain stripped
himself of every garment he could spare
to spread under bim : drenched with wet,

they afforded no warmth to his chilled
frame. He had in vain searched the rock
for one drop of water to quench the burn-
ing thirst of frenzy: he returned, from
his hopeless wandering, and passed the
whole of that dreadful night in listening
to the moan of hunger, and the scream
of madness. . -
Famine drove him out the next day in
search of that relief, without which it
was now impossible to live. His know-
ledge of the country enabled him to avoid
every place probably frequented by the
soldiers, but it confined him to those,
where no inhabitant was to be found, and
no food could be procured. At length
he saw a cabin on the side of the moun-
tain he was wandering on, and, desperate
from want, hurried towards it. An el-
derly woman was sitting at the door:
she was in rags, her eyes were wild, and
the stillness of her posture had no alliance
with the wandering fierceness of her look.

in Irish, implored some food for a fa-

him for some time, and then said, in a
hurried voice: '
“ Yes, yes, I have food enough-
enough for you and me: come in, come
in, and let us enjoy it together.”
Connal followed her into the cabin.

the eloquence of despair, pointing to the
corpse, " there he lies: you have laid
him there. There is the feast I promised
you : you may devour him yourself, for
that is all you have left me to give you.
There, gnaw his bones, but leave his
heart to his mother.” And with a yell
of agony, she threw herself on the body.
Connal flew from the cabin with the
swiftness of lightning ; but faster than

still the dreadful cry, multiplied a thou-
sand-fold by the mountain echoes, rung
in his ears-- Woe, woe to the bloody
house of O'Morven! The curse of a
· broken-hearted mother on the bloody
house of O’Morven!”
When he had got to a distance, he
sunk on his knees on the earth, and the
prayer, of deprecation, “ Not unto me,
oh, heaven! not unto me,” burst from
his heart, but his parched lips could not
utter the sounds : yet, dreadful as his
reception was in this house of death, he
dreaded still more to return, and see a
parent die of hunger on his bed of stone.
“ Yesterday,” he thought, " I com-
manded an army, and to day I pray for
the sight of one human being who will
give me a morsel of bread, and pray in
vain." ' As he spoke,' a boy,, running
with the speed of a mountaineer, passed
him.
Connal called after him, but the boy

ran faster, and when Connal pursued
him, falling on his knees, implored him
to spare his life. “Do I look like a
murderer then ?" said Connal, retreating;
and for the first time, his eye glancing
on his own figure, he ceased to wonder
at the child's 'terror. Almost naked,
stained with blood ( for bis exertions had
made his wounds bleed afresh), ghastly
with famine, slaughter, and despair, even
the grace and dignity of his figure ap-
peared like the wild grandeur of a ma-
niac, and added terror to his appearance.
But the sound of his voice, which not
even despair could divest of harmony,
dispelled the fears of the boy, and he in-
formed him he was the son of a cottager
on the mountain, and was sent on a mes-
sage to young O'Morven at the castle
from the house below (pointing in the
direction where St. Austin's house stood),
as none of the servants from that house
would be admitted by Lady Montclare."
“ Young O'Morgen!” said Connal, in

amazement, “ is Desmond at the castle ?
Is he alive and safe?”
" He is,” said the boy.; “ I saw him
to-day.”
« Oh! heaven has not deserted us,”
cried Connal, the tears bursting from his
seared eyes.
“ While Desmond has life, we shall not
be let to perish.
- Fly to the castle, and tell him his
grandfather is starving in a cave on this
bleak mountain. Do not let him expose
his safety by coming in search of us:
let him but send us food ; and, oh! im-
plore him to send it soon, for in an hour
it may arrive too late."
The boy promised, and Connal returned
to his dreary retreat ; but unable to enter
it without relief, he stood at the entrance
armed with the only weapon the rock af-
forded the fragment of a gigantic ash
that grew in one of its fissures. All day ·
he strained his eyes over the distant heath
for the return of the messenger, till his

heart sickening with expectation, and
his sight dim with weakness, and unable
to penetrate the gathering darkness, he
sunk into the cave, and raising his grand-
- father's head on his breast, felt that the
pangs that now tore it would be the last.
A quick, light step approached. "Ah!
that is Desmond's light foot,” said Con-
nal, starting from the ground. It was
the boy.
After waiting for some hours, he was
told that O'Morven did not believe the
message was from his brother. "How
can I convince him?” said Connal :
“ whoever sent the message he must at
least have known required the relief he
supplicated. I could not have trifled
thus with the misery of famine." And
his anguish for a moment overpowered
his confidence in Desmond. " I have no
means left of satisfying him but this,”
said he, and with his blood he scrawled
on a piece of slate the name of Connal,
and gave it to the boy, imploring him to

deliver it, if possible, to Desmond him-
self. The boy looked terrified at this
second commission, and then confessed
that two men had followed him over the
mountain, and were now approaching
the cave. “ We are betrayed,” said
Connal, and the force of a giant seemed
to nerve his arm, as he sprung forward
to guard his parent's dying moment from
insult. - They shall feel that the blows
of a famished man are as fierce as the
hunger that is tearing his vitals: better
to starve on this black rock than to pe-
rish on their gibbets.” Two men ap-
proached, but they came with no hostile
intention :- they were men, who, though
strictly loyal, felt that dignified compas-
sion for Connal which his character had
inspired, even in his enemies, and con-
jecturing his situation, they had wandered
all day on the mountain in quest of him,
and at length discovered his retreat by

by the necessity of their own safety, for

their motive for intruding on his retreat,

him to one of their cabins, where he would

know not what to believe, or whom to

“ but it is so long since I have heard
even the language of humanity, that I
cannot resist it. Lead me where you
will, but remember that this hand, though
unarmed, can deal with twice its odds,
and even were it withered this moment,
there is another that can reach those that
oppress the defenceless and the trusting.”

the deplorable state of O’Morsen and his
grandfather, they shed tears of grief and
indignation, and one of them could not
forbear expressions of resentment at the
abuses of principle and habit by which
such a man as Connal had been driven to
extremes so horrible. " Hold,” said
Conpal, his inextinguishable soul flashing
from his eyes: “not a word against that
venerable wretch: his prejudices, his er-
rors are to me as hallowed as his white
hairs, and like them, if they are torn up,
the blood will follow." His spirit, even
amid ruin and wretchedness, awed the
very men upon whom his existence de-
pended, and they silently prepared to re-
move the old man from the stones on
which they found him stretched, but they
viewed each other with looks that inti-
mated their help had come too late.

rock, for the soldiers were still about the
country, and his exhausted state render-

of their own habitations, they placed him
in one of the huts in which the shep-
herds watch the cattle during summer,
and which was now deserted. Food was
brought to them; but the deadly sickness
which Connal felt at the sight of it made
him unable to taste a morsel, and it was
with the utmost difficulty he could prevent
his grandfather from devouring, with
the 'ravenous appetite of madness, a quan-
tity that would have destroyed him. He
then hurried the men away, lest their
being absent from their homes at night
might expose them to danger on his ac-

straw and a draught of cold water, he
sunk into a slumber.

He advanced with a boding apprehen-
sion for which he could not account: the
procession stopped for a moment, and he
discovered it was a funeral.
He attempted to ask whose it was; but
his voice failed, and he was compelled to
lean for support on the person of whom
he inquired.
The man, who was one of the bearers,
did not recognize his figure in the shade,
and he answered abruptly it was the fu-
neral of O’Morven, who had been so
lately married to Lady Montclare. -
“My father !” cried Desmond, fall-
ing breathless into the arms of his in-
former.
The report that one of O'Morven's
sons was among them spread through the
attendants ; but there was no one there
that would betray him. O
He was borne back to the castle by
some of them, who thought they might
as well have suffered his corse-like figure
to accompany bis father.

Lady Montclare, from the window of
her apartment, beheld him by the torches
which the bearers had now lit, and at
that moment the plan which she had been
revolving ever since she had got Armida
into her power appeared for the first time
practicable.
Trembling in her castle, this unhappy
victim of her own arts looked round, and
beheld the ruin she had brought on all
connected with her witliout procuring
safety for herself.
By her constant irritation of Wandes-
ford against Coonal he had been impelled
to that treachery which had driven the
latter into rebellion and ruin. By her
want of confidence in Armida she had
been urged to follow the desperate for-
tunes of Connal.
Her arts had driven Desmond and
Ines to destruction. Her agent, Moro-
sini, had perished in the execution of her
plans ; and the wretched O'Morven,
wearied by her violence, and terrified by

her crimes, had, after one of the furious
conflicts with which their short and un-
happy marriage was attended, burst a
blood vessel, and expired in her sight.
Yet amid all this wide-spreading mis-
chief she felt that almost all she had
dreaded were either removed or no longer
capable of molesting her.
Wandesford, intent only on vengeance,
had probably forgot that such a being as
Endymion once existed.
Connal, a hunted fugitive, whose life
was forfeited to the laws, could inspire no
fears. Her husband was no more, and Des-
mond, whose knowledge of her 'secret
she could not doubt, was at length in her
power, the last and only being she feared ;
and the plan that she now conceived,
atrocious and wild as it was, seemed pro.
bable from the moment she beheld him.
She hastened to attend him in person :
she scattered rich and reviving essences
over him with her own hands, and the

lifeless appearance of him whom she
remembered so lately warm in youth and
beauty, a blooming husband, and almost
parent, deterred'her not from sacrificing
the remains of his doubtful existence to
her plans the moment it was restored.
As he revived she assumed that aspect
of sober and matron grief that she be-
lieved would conciliate his feelings; and
the moment he was able to hear or to un-
derstand her, she commenced the deve-
lopment of her scheme.
Desmond at first revolted from it with
horror: his reason was outraged by its
improbability, and his feelings were torn
by its violence; but he was no opponent
for the woman he had to deal with. Her
sophistry, her eloquence, and her passion,
were alternately exerted. The opposition
of his reason she overcame by evidences
that seemed irresistible, and the conflict
of his feelings she stilled by an appeal
still more powerful. He yielded at length,

and she hurried to Armida, to subdue
the only resistance to her purpose which
she still feared.
Armida, whose reason was just suffi.
ciently restored to comprehend her mean-
ing, but who, in her delirious terror,
grasped at any thing that promised immu-
nity from the last and only evil she dread-
ed, submitted even more speedily than
Desmond ; and Lady Montclare, exulting
in her success, and unmoved by the suf-."
ferings of her victims, set out herself on
foot at that late hour in quest of a confi-
dential agent in the neighbourhood.
She was returning alone: it was almost
midnight; but, occupied by her own
thoughts, she heeded neither solitude nor
darkness, till, as she was ascending the
rocky terrace that bounded the castle on
the sea-side, a figure started forwards,
and crossed her path. She looked up,
and screamed with undissembled terror.
It was Coonal, and his figure, wild,
wasted, almost supernatural, seemed in

shrinking from his look, though half its
terrific expression had not encountered
her.
"Yes, Connal! the wretch whom your
crimes, combined with those of others,
have reduced to a spectre that blasts your
sight.” .
"Do you forget my rank?-Do you
forget my sex ?" said Lady Montclare,
trying to assume a dignity of which her
yices bad deprived her.
“ Yes, I have forgot every thing: I.
have lived to forget the laws that bind
man to reverence woman, or to love his
species. Wretched woman! shrink not
from me: injured as I am, for the mean-
est of your sex I would yet shed the last
drop of blood that is left in these veins :

how will you bear what I must say to you

“Oh! heavens !” said Lady Mont-
clare, struggling in terror, " do you mean
'to murder me ?"
“ Yes; I mean to pierce you to the
very heart, if you have one.-Look at
me,” he cried, holding her at arm's length
from his figure, while she shuddered at
its dark unearthly majesty ; “look at
me! I am stained with blood, I am squa-

born Armida, will sit under the shadow of

“Merciful heaven ! deliver me from

The terrified wretch sunk on her knees,
and with the most horrid perjuries at-
tested heaven that this marriage was
Armida's own choice, and that her influ-
ence. had never been exerted to accom-
plish it.

" You shall see her,” said Lady Mont-
clare, who in the midst of terror had
made this demand subservient to her
plans; “ you shall see her this night,
and hear from her own lips what I have
told you."
“ I fear you,” said Connal, musing,
" I fear you are too much for me. I
cannot penetrate your purposes : would

attempt is desperate. Think, think, un-

"I can give no other security," said
Lady Montclare, unmoved at this appeal.
* Go," said Connal, releasing her, “I
trust you not; but remember I will see
Armida :” and he stretched himself on a
rock before the castle-gate: she implored
him to seek some concealment, but he
listened to her with a disdainful smile,
and at length she retired.
It was now that she was compelled to
put forth all her strength to prevent the
consequences of this interview, for she
saw too well the fixed despair of Connal
to hope it could be avoided. She has-
tened to Armida..
- The same arguments that had prevailed
on her to submit to the marriage were
employed to make her consent to this in-
terview without disclosing her motives.

she had nothing more to dread, exhausted

Armida and Connal met :--for two
hours that they remained together Lady
Montclare endured almost the punish-
ment due to her crimes, from the appre-
hension that Armida’s constancy might
fail. . At length she heard the door open:.
she flew from her apartment, she saw
Connal depart with a firm step, and with-
out one reverted look; and Armida ap-
proached with a calmness of aspect that
terrified her, for her guilty conscience
was alarmed by every thing. She would
have spoken to her, but Armida waved
her hand with an expression that would,
not be resisted, and the smile that divided
her pale lips had more terror for her
guilty parent than the loudest reproaches.
Connal returned to the hovel where
the corse of his grandfather had lain

and so deep was the stupefaction that
had invaded his mind and senses since
the last interview with Armida, that
it was not till after he had entered the
hut he saw it was filled with the fa-
mily who had sheltered him, and who
were in despair.
During his absence, the soldiers who
were in search of him had broken into
the cottage, and convinced of his having
been harboured there set it on fire, and
the wretched family, half naked, fled for
their lives to seek shelter in the hovel
which had protected the O'Morvens.

flames !” burst all at once on the eyes

He stood for a moment gazing on them:

the situation in which he beheld them
required not a word to explain it : he
paused, and then grasping the wretched
father's hand, said calmly, “ Your son
shall be restored to you; I will be his ran,
som,” and quitted the. hovel without
another word.
It was now midnight: he set out alone
to surrender himself to Wandesford : he
paused for a moment, but the cries that
seemed to pursue him made him spring
forward.
« Nature is weary of me,” said he, as
he stood alone under the black cope of a
starless night: “ I have nothing more to
do or suffer. Nothing remains for me
but the last struggle; and what will that
be compared to what I have been suf.
fering for years of my life, and almost
every day of those years. Armida ! and
you have deserted me: deserted me when
I had torn the last nerves of my heart to
place you in safety, and at a distance.

mankind could not have made me be-

appears the result of mystery, of derange-
ment: I could hardly believe it was

greatest of all mysteries will shortly be
developed : po deception will blind Wan-
desford when he sees his victim in his
power. I cannot summon the strength I
wish to meet my last conflict with : if I
think of her I shall tremble like a coward,
and my enemies will believe it the fear of
death. I will pause till I have forgot
her, if that be possible.”
He threw himself on the ground for a
moment, but the thoughts of the unfor-
tunate family rushed on his mind. He
sprung from the ground, and a feeling of
indignation warmed his breast as he ex-
claimed: " And I escaped from war, and
peril, and famine, to fall at last by the
falsehood of a woman : and in the arms

Wandesford, though it was past mid-
might when he heard that Connal had
arrived at his quarters to surrender him-
self, started from his bed with joy. He
dismissed the soldier who brought him
the intelligence, and walked up and down
his room to deliberate how he should
treat his prisoner. The debate ended in
the most diabolical and unmanly ven-
geance : it was not from any fixed po-
litical principle, or a view of the dangers
with which Connal's perverted education
and heroic passions menaced his country,
that Wandesford had pursued him with
such hostility; his feeling was personal
hatred, and his object the vengeance of an
assassin. He did not put him to death,
for he wished his sufferings to survive
beyond death : similar punishments were

and to dismiss him if he survived their

Conoal submitted to what he knew it

over his mangled frame a cloak which

It was late on that eventful night when

i arrived at the castle. The servants seemed

power of management, insisted on her
presence, and Lady Montclare had no
pretext for refusing. From the messen-
ger who had come for her, and whom
she repeatedly questioned during her short
journey, she could learn nothing, for
he knew only that Armida was to be
married that night, and that the castle
was all in a tumult of preparation.
Rosine, when she entered the hall,
found herself unable to proceed another
step, and she retired into a small apart-
ment which she remembered well, while
the servant went to announce her arrival
to Armida. The room was empty, but a
door was open to an adjacent apartment
where lights were burning, and from
which she heard the sound of voices :
at first she did not distinguish them, and
her weakness left her no power of re-
tiring when she did.
After a long debate, which the emotion
of the speakers rendered almost inarticu-
late she heard Desmond distinctlyexclaim,

' “ Marry the object of my brother's
love ! the woman devoted to him, and to
him alone! there is incest in the very
thought.”
She could not hear Lady Montclare's
reply, but she thought from the expression
of “ Connal's life,” that occurred so often
in it, that he submitted from some fear
that threatened it. A pause ensued, and
Desmond then in a voice broken with
agony exclaimed : “II, who was the
husband of her sister !" .
Lady Montclare then audibly reminded
him that the religion of her family being
catholic, a dispensation had already been
procured for his being the husband of
two sisters : a long silence followed, but
the opportunity for reflexion which it
afforded Rosine was jo vain: bewildered
and distracted, she could not form a con.
jecture with regard to what she had
heard, or what she was to witness. The
marriage of Desmond and Armida seemed
to throw a mist over her faculties, and

when the servant returned to conduct her
to Armida, she followed him as she would
the phantom of a dream.
The apartments of Armida, splendidly
illuminated, and lavishly decorated with
the brilliant monuments of her former
talents, increased her wonder, and the
silent and lifeless beauty of the statues
and paintings as she moved among them,
and felt the recollections excited by these
well-known objects, made her feel as if
she was entering the regions of the dead.
As she traversed the apartments in a dis-
tant room, she caught a view of Armida's
figure: she hurried forward, and Armida
advanced to meet her : she was magnifi-
cently dressed, and there was an air of
triumph and splendour in her figure and
expression that Rosine never remembered
to have beheld, but which would have
recalled the memory of her earlier days
to those who had known ber in Italy.
Rosine was almost dazzled by this bril-
liant phantom bursting on her, after the

darkness of her night journey, and she
paused, unable to speak or to answer, till
relieved by tears. Armida expressed
pleasure at seeing her, but her manner
was hurried and abstracted, and she had
stopped in the midst of the shortest sen-
tences as if she had forgot their meaning.
At length she said with a smile that Ro-
sine thought far from her heart, “ You
must not weep, Rosine ; remember this is
a bridal festival."
"I fear,” said Rosine, trying to reco-
ver her spirits, “I fear I shall disgrace
you in this homely dress: I am unfit to be
the attendant of so splendid a bride." .
Armida cast her eyes for a moment on
Rosine, and then on her own gorgeous
dress, the contrast between their feelings,
and their external appearance, seemed to
strike her with agonizing force; she
turned away, and the expression of her
countegance for a moment reininded Ro-
sine of the time when the haughty and
brilliant Armida knew no one on earth

her talents, or resist her power.
She continued to walk up and down
the room with a hurried step. Rosine
often attempted to speak, but her voice
failed her, till at length, unable to bear
the oppression of her heart, she ventured
to inquire the reason of this precipitate
marriage.
" You do not know it yet,” said Ar-
mida, suddenly stopping and viewing her
intently.
Rosine declared her ignorance even of
the event itself till she was summoned to
witness it.
." You will know it too soon perhaps,”!
said Armida, after a long pause : “ till
then spare yourself and me all inquiries,”
As she continued to walk, her figure
reflected in a mirror caught her eye for a
moment, and snatching a light that
burned on the table, she stood before
Rosine : “Am I not a brilliant figure ?"
said she.

: “ You are indeed,” said Rosine; “but
do not look at me so intently, Armida :
I cannot bear the brightness of your
eyes, and there is something in their ex-
pression that alarms me."
" Yes," said Armida, " the world
might wonder at such a sacrifice, but
they know not for whom it is made."
“ Dear Armida,” said Rosine, “ why
do you call your marriage a sacrifice, and
if it does not contribute to happiness (as
I guess too well) why is it made?"
“Yes, yes,” said Armida," it will con-
tribute to my peace effectually, beyond
all human expedients, or human power to
disturb.".
;"I do not understand you,” said Ro-
sine ;' and sick with unspeakable fears,
she turned to the window she was sitting
at, and opening it, gasped for breath.
Armida approached the window. The
night was calm and beautiful, the clouds
were dispersed, and every star in heaven
burned with clear and steady lustre.

" How this solemn light changes every
object!” said Rosine: “ how different you
appear to me from what you did but a
few moments past ! your glittering dress
has grown dim, and you look deadly
pale;" for she could not believe that
feeling could produce so total a change
as Armida's countenance betrayed while
she looked at her.
: o Rosine," said Armida, suddenly and
solemnly interrupting her, "you are reli.
gious; you are conversant with those
solemn things that have been only matter
of curiosity, of vague speculation to me.
Have you ever discovered what was the
fate of those beings whom misfortune has
made weary of life--whom ”and she
stopped, unable to find words that could
convey her meaning without terrifying
her companion.
. “ Ah!” said Rosine, eagerly catching
at the sound of religion, “ the truths
I have been taught have convinced me
that they alone afford a shelter from the

which the world cannot give, and the
world cannot take away."
“Rosine, you have been nursed in reli-
gion, and you turn to it from nature and
from habit: to you it is like the return of
a wanderer to his father's house, but to

Rosine, with the eloquence of affection,
and the energy of devotion, interrupted
her, and she painted the blessedness of
the spirit that reposes its cares and its
struggles in the bosom of eternal peace,
and sees the waves of a stormy world
burst at its feet.
“ I have read much like this," said
Armida,“ but can you answer my ques-
tion—can you tell the fate of departed

do they obtain a glimpse of the object

- Darkness rests upon every question
that does not belong to our peace,” said
Rosine.
« Then let us have no more of it,"
said Armida, wearily: " and why,” she
added, “ why harass ourselves and our
fellow-creatures with questions that a
few moments must solve to them and us.".
She turned away as she spoke.
"A few moments !” repeated Rosine,
following her ; “ how can a few moments
disclose what life is upable to inform us ?
We must wait with faith and patience
for these discoveries."
... There is perhaps another way of ar-
riving at them,” said Armida, thought-
fully. .
“ It is eternity alone can inform us,".
said Rosine.
“ It is on eternity I will call to tell me,"
replied Armida.

Her dreadful meaning burst on Rosine
in that moment: she stood at first gasp-

rush from the room.
“ Where are you going?” said Armida,
detaining her.
“ To alarm the castle--to call for assist-
ance. Armida, do not struggle with me:

god?"
“ Be calm, Rosine; I promise you I
will not seek the means of death to-

Rosine looked doubtfully at her, but
she had no other resource but to believe
her: a long silence followed, and the con-

that invaded all her faculties.
“You are exhausted,” said Armida,
looking at her with compassion: “will you
take some refreshment, or will you throw
yourself on that sofa, and take some re.
pose ?".
“ No, no ; it is late, but I feel no wea-

remember wbęn I watched you in the
ruined abbey?”
Yes, but let us talk not of misfor-
tunes now: the evil is past ; let this night
hear only the sounds of joy,” said Ar-
mida with frantic irony.
Rosine now resorted to any topic to
avoid the oppressive silence that followed.
" When is this marriage to take place?"
said she.
" At midnight the priest is expected,"
said Armida, " and till then, Rosine, I
wish to be a few moments alone. I have

"May they restore your peace,” said
Rosine, retiring: “I will pass the time
in praying for it.”
“Ithank you," said Armida, when she
found herself alone, “ but I fear heaven

steps into her cabinet, the apartment
where Coonal and she had met the second
time she ever beheld him. She looked

desolation, and at the misfortunes that
had driveu her to end by violence a life

Her paintings, by the brilliancy of their
colours, seemed to contrast the fate of
their author: a veil that had been ac-

ing spirits gather round me, like the
breezes of evening whispering in the ear
of the hastening traveller."
On the table lay also some of the rich
ornaments she had taken out that evening:
she gazed on them for some time.
“ Brilliant toys! how vainly ye spar-
kle in the eyes of death: never will ye
sparkle on a breast that beat more strong-
ly with the ambition of genius, or the
enthusiasm of passion. How often ye
have adorned me for their brilliant tri-
umphs, and you will sparkle when I am
faded and cold.. There is not one of
these that does not commemorate some
hour of different existence. This bracelet
my poor father gave me the first night I
sung in public; how proud he was then,
and how proud was I. This armlet I
drew the design for myself, and the are,

only to contrast the gloom of death : does
it not reproach us with that lustre it
gives to cheeks that must soon be pale,
and eyes that are hastening to close while
they view it?”
These objects of art wearied her by
their opposition to nature and passion,
whose resources she had been compelled
to explore so deeply. Her heart in this
last hour turned to those grand and ex-
pansive views that awaken in the parting
soul a consciousness of immortal energy,
and are assimilated to its profoundest.
emotions. She gazed on the night, and
the host of heaven; and the breeze
entering through the window, as it swept
the strings of her harp, awoke those in-
definite tones that accorded with the deep
and mingled agitations of her soul, and
whispered that harmony of death that the
dying can only feel, and the living seek
the image of in vain.-

Montclare in his life-time had com-
municated to Armida the medical know-
ledge which he possessed in no common
degree: among other extraordinary pur-
suits he had accustomed himself to the
composition of poisons, and he had ex-
tracted one that after lingering in the
frame for eight and forty hours, had the
power of dismissing life without a strug-
gle or a pang. He deposited this in a
closet, and told her where it was to be
found: she remembered it well: it was
in the very spot he had mentioned. She
took it: it was a small vial with a pale
liquor. She sat down with it in her hand,
and remained for some moments in a state
of stupefaction. It was in vain she at-
tempted to collect her thoughts ; the last
struggle had exhausted her heart, and
though she gazed round the room with a
quick and sparkling eye, she beheld only
vacancy: suddenly a step approaches :
she started up, and afraid of an intruder,

swallowed it in a moment. The consci-
ousness that her fate was now decided
restored her resolution. The blood re-'.
turning to her cheek flushed it almost
with a sparkling crimson; her eyes shone
with unusual light, and an awful and
indefinite joy wandered through her
heart. She was now in a state that had
in one moment reduced the tyrants of her
fate to the impotency of worms; the
power of the whole earth could not com-
pel her to suffer another pang, and the
grandeur of this self-liberation supported
her pride agaiost its terrors. Rosine re-
entered the room to tell her she was sum-
moned to the chapel : she was astonished
at the sudden and supernatural dignity of
her figure, her silence, and the firm step
with which she quitted the apartment.
Lady Montclare, Desmond, and the
priest, were waiting for them. The
chapel was dimly lit, and the faces, pale
with different emotions, looked almost
sepulchral in each others eyes: there

was a long pause, till Lady Montclare
whispered some words to Desmond, who
was leaning dejectedly against the railing
of the altar : he started, and advancing,
offered his hand to Armida. The priest
opened the book, and even at that mo-
ment Rosine could not believe they were
to be united, and she looked round in
fixed and visionary expectation of some
interruption. The ceremony begun :, a
shriek that seemed to pierce their ears
rung through the chapel : they started,"
and the priest stopped : it was followed
by a few notes so wild, so plaintive, so
unearthly, that it seemed the song of a
maniac or a spirit.
Desmond dropt the hand of Armida,
and, his eyes dilated with horror, gazed
in the direction from which that well
known voice seemed to come. The
chapel door slowly opened, and a figure,
so fair, so faint, so transparent, it seemed
the embodied spirit of the breeze ap-
peared at it. Lady Montclare rushed

grave, and borne away by her mother's
agents to the castle on the night their
retreat was invaded, and while Desmond,
who had lost his senses on seeing her
plunge into the river, was alike unable to
defend, and unconscious where she was
conveyed.
Almost immediately on her arrival at
the castle she was delivered of a dead
child, and her sufferings operating on
her situation, deranged her irrecoverably,
though care preserved her life. Her
mother, finding her unable to act in sub-
servience to her plans, had confined and
watched her with such strictness that the
secret of her résidence at the castle never
had transpired, till this night, when Lady

wretched Desmond, almost crushing her
to his wasted heart. ,
"I do not know you," exclaimed Ines;
and tearing herself from his arms, she
imagined she saw the corse of her child,
and beating the ground with her hands,
she shrieked—'Dead eyes, dead eyes, will
you not look at me? Will you not reach

ther: " and you knew she was alive, and
you would have wedded me to her sister.
What mystery of hell is this ! - You told
me it was to save Connal's life. Speak,

sex, and do some vengeance on you aś
horrible as your crimes."

little consequence " -

not, Ines ?”
“ Be calm, be calm,” said Rosine,
who knelt on the ground to support the
exhausted maniac. .
“I will, I will,” cried Desmond,
grasping her band : “I will not utter a
word: I will sit here and watch her.
Ines, oh! God! her eyes look wilder:
she will never, never know me again. I
cannot bear to look at her,” he exclaimed,
starting away: “ only tell me when her
eyes look calmer.”
Ines, released from his hold, rose
feebly: she wandered about for some
time, and her mother, defeated and terri.
fied, did not dare to impede her. At
length Armida's figure caught her eye,
and she eagerly but timidly approached
her.
Armida already felt the chill of death
in her veins; but nature still asserted its
claims in her heart, and as the poor ma-

ness, sunk before her, she fell on her neck,
and wept even to agony. Ines gazed on
her wildly..
“ I know you," she said, " I know
you; but I cannot tell your name. I
have forgot every thing but misfortune.
You were unhappy too. I remember
your stately love :---they said he was a
prince :-on earth there was none like
him but my own; but mine was fairer,
fresher, softer. I wooed a flower, and
died of its fragrance : you clung to an
oak; but the lightning struck it, and it
crushed you in its fall. We were both
ill-fated; but we will go to some world
where no false lover shall come, and be
happy, when I have found my babe.”
Armida, deluged with tears, had no '
power to answer.
" How glorious you are,” cried Ines,
still gazing on her ; " and yet you weep

a storm ; yet you followed him through
mist and darkness : -- did you not follow

“I did, I did," cried Armida.

arms of Rosine. When she recovered,
she found herself in her apartment again.
All thoughts of this dreadful marriage
were over. Rosine was kneeling beside
her : she started up, and reflected with
despair that life had been sacrificed in
vain, for she had been impelled to believe
that Connal's life depended on her imme-
diate union with Desmond.

be kept, and she implored Rosine to
watch for him at the passage by the
rocky terrace where he was to be admit-
ted to her apartment, while she tried to
collect her thoughts for this last meeting.
• Connal had wandered about the castle
from the moment the night shut in. He
bore the load of life for a few hours still,
for Armida had promised that night to
disclose the motive that impelled her to a :
marriage with Desmond. As he lingered
like a spectre beneath the walls, Wandes-
ford, returning from a party with whom
he had dined, rode past him. The for-
bearance of Connal was past: he had
shaken hands with life, and he knew from
many inexpressible warnings that his last
hour was near. He instantly pursued
Wandesford, and, seizing his bridle, or-
dered him in a tone that would not be
disobeyed to dismount and listen to him.
His servants bad rode on towards his
quarters, and he had no means of resist-
ance. He recognised Connal, and his

calmness of a desperate man, “ I have
a few words to say, and you must listen
to me. Whenever we b'a ve met, fortune
has made a difference between us that

tim. You have had rank, power, and
lawful authority on your side, and how
you have used it I need not remind you.
Enjoy its remembrance as you can, for
its last term has arrived : this accidental
meeting has removed the difference: we
are now as nature made us. It is mid-
night, we are alone, and before we part
we must try to which of us nature will
allot the victory in a personal struggle.”

The proud spirit of Wandesford flushed
in his face.
“ It shall never be said,” he cried,
" that I shrunk from chastising a wretch
whom his crimes had already degraded to
the level of the most ignominious punish-
ment.”
His pistols were loaded : he gave
one of them to Connal; bnt, trembling
with rage and hatred, he discharged his
own instantly. It missed the aim ; but
Connal's was surer: the ball passed
through Wandesford's heart. He fell.

fearful companions of his dying moments.
After a struggle more bitter than death,

rise from the bloody ground. It was too
late.
Connal bowed to raise him; but he

distorted feature of death, and his pas-
sions were extinguished by the sight.
He bent close to the dying man, that he
might whisper peace to his spirit; but
his ear was cold.
"He is no more,” said Connal; " and
with him die my last human feelings.-I
am fit to meet her now, for I am beyond
resentment for ever.".
· He turned to the castle.
" Surely,” said he, " the night is
darkened by the horrors it has witnessed,
or my senses fail me, for I soarce can dis-
tinguish my way. No lights burn in
the castle : nothing shines on me from
heaven or earth : the stars are gone out:
there is a terror in this darkness more
than darkness can bring. Surely my last
hour approaches ; the shadows are
lengthening, and the traveller is warned
of the end of his journey.”

ment: neither of them spoke, and she
setired, unable to witness their meeting.

There was a strange contrast between
Armida, seated alone in this midnight
and disastrous pomp, her cheek burning,
and her expression exalted by the effect
of the poison, and Connal, who, pale,
bloody, and baggard, stood at a distance
gazing on her resplendent figure, that
seemed to him like the radiance of the
apostate since his fall. The contrast was
heightened by a long and mutual silence.
“ Why do you gaze on me?” said Ar-
mida, forcing him to speak, that she
might assure herself it was not a spectre
she saw.
" I know not why,” said Connal ; " for
I can scarce believe the eyes I see you
with, Armida. And have I lost you,
whom neither danger or distress could
drive from my ruined side? What error
of head, or wandering of heart misled

most a crime.".

. " I cannot utter them,” said Connal,
" my heart is too heavy. And why did
you assume that splendour to insult a
wretch whose eyes have never gazed but
on misery since we parted ?"
"I wore it that you might see for the
last time what I have been. Connal, this
is our last moment, and let us pass it like
lovers : let no reproach, no resentment
disturb it. We have loved as none ever
loved, in grief and in danger, and we will
part as none have parted, in triumph.”
“ Yes,” said Connal, sternly, “ such
triumph as these wounds, this broken
heart can afford you."
- Hush! hush!” cried Armida, sud-
denly rising, and approaching him with
aërial and frantic animation, « not a
murmur more. Let these last moments

she, pausing : .“ not a ray of mind will

its last accents: these eyes gaze on you

Connal raised her in his arms.

here not to weep, but to inquire. Ar-
mida, tell me the motive of your mar.
riage with Desmond.”
“ Not yet, not yet,” said Armida ;
" you will know too soon, and yet you
will know too late.”
6 I have not strength to penetrate these
mysteries, and I have not time. It is
past midnight, and before the morning
breaks I feel the traveller will be far on
his last journey. Armida, tell me the
motive of your marriage with Desmond.”
Armida was silent. Connal bore her

to the stars that had emerged in full glory
from the passing clouds.
« No being ever yet shrunk from the
truth under such an appeal : by those
bright lights of heaven I adjare you, and
will you not tell me the truth ?”.
Armida wished that he should witness
her last moments, but she felt it was
impossible to delay the explanation
longer.
“ Connal, have I not wandered ? Have
I not suffered with you? Have I not loved
you as never woman loved ? Have I not
followed you with a constancy passing
that of woman?"
- You have. You have been to me
what no words can utter."
" Was there another proof in human
power to give of my devotion to you ?”
“ None.”
“ Yes, there was one more to die for
you."
“For me!"

“ Ab! what other motive could she,
who loved as I did, have for resigning
you, and uniting myself to another ?”
“What mystery is this-your life, and
my safety! What connexion could there
be between them, severed as we are ?"
" Ask Wandesford that,” said Armida,
speaking with difficulty.
" It is too late,” said Connal, “ to
ask Wandesford : he is gone to answer at
another tribunal : he fell by my hand to-
night. Armida, how pale you grow.
What change is this? You tremble, yet
your hands burn; and those eyes -
Armida, speak to me."
“ Connal, tell me truly, is Wandesford
no more ?"
“ Wandesford is no more.”
“Oh!" she cried, with a scream of
horror, " we have been the victims of
unexampled treachery."
“ Armida, while I have breath to ask
you, tell me what is the cause of the
horror you express at the fate of Wan-

then your choice, or was it all the mockery
of fiends?”
“ I fear it was, Connal; I cannot ima-
gine, I cannot speak. Oh, Connal! my
mother made me believe you were Wan-
desford's prisoner, and that he would
spare your life solely on the condition
-I cannot breathe.”
“Go on, go on," cried the frantic
Connal.

“On the condition that I should be-

was told the same. I believed it, I trem-
bled, I consented ; but when I had se-
.cured your safety as I hoped, I found it
impossible to live: I swallowed poison--
it is now working in my veins. For you
I would have wedded, for you I am ex-
piring, and in vain.”
"I never was Wandesford's prisoner:
I would not have bought an existence for
ages by the sacrifice of one moment of
your's. I would have died, ten thousand

She sunk on the ground beside him, as
he koelt: not a word was heard, not a
tear was shed. Their locked and frozen
hearts forgot feeling and pulsation, and
death seemed already to have invaded the
cold arms in which they clasped each

The dead silence that pervaded the
castle was broke by the trampling of
horses, the clash of arms, and the cla-
mour of soldiers. The party who had
been out several days in pursuit of Connal
had at length traced him to the castle :

been for his ruin, opposed their entrance
in vain,
He was torn from the convulsed but
senseless grasp of Armida, and conducted
to the quarters of the commanding officer,
since Wandes ford's death, to take his
trial for rebellion, by military law. ;
It was noon when Armida, on whom
The poison had not yet operated with
mortal force, was restored to recollection.
The intenseness of her sufferings awoke
every faculty at once: sbe remembered
distinctly every event of the preceding
night, and determined in a moment to
follow him to the extremity of his fate.
Rosine did not dare to oppose her: her
resolution, silently taken, but perfectly
understood, admitted of po opposition : but
as she was tearing off the ornaments that
still glittered round her corse-like figure,

mother stood before her. Armida, with a
smile of angel forbearance, waved her
hand to her to retire. Lady Montclare
fell on her knees before her immolated
child, to implore her to for bear this last
public exposure of her feelings.
“Mother,” said Armida, “God forgive
you! go and restore Ines to her reason if
you can, I am beyond your care."
When she reached the hall, she saw
the carriage prepared, and the servants
waiting to attend her; she dismissed
them.
“This pomp does not suit me now," said
she: “the bride of a rebel must seek him
on foot, yet I am prouder this moment
than if I were ascending a throne.
Rosine, you will not desert me, it is my
last journey, and exhausted friendship
will not shrink from its final task.”
" I have never shrunk," said the weep-
ing Rosine : "spare me but words, and I
will follow you while my strength sup-
ports me."

was
It was late when they reached the town
where Conual was confined. Armida's
person was unknown as she passed
through the streets, but the dignity of
her figure, her flushed cheek, and her
dishevelled hair, which had escaped from
the band, and streamed on her shoulders,
struck every passenger, and all that saw
her conceived at once that her arrival
was connected with the fate of Connal.
This impression facilitated the inquiries
Rosine made for him, and she was in-
formed that he was on his trial at that
moment, at the barracks, at a mile's dis-
tance. Thither the wanderers followed
him : some of the poorer inhabitants pur-
sued them, to gaze on Armida, whose
beauty, though alternately flushed with
emotion, and pale with the approach of
death, was beyond all they had ever
imagined. Some of them wondered in
silence, but some of them prayed aloud
for her success, though they knew not
the cause in which she was engaged,

for thanks, but she eagerly scattered the
contents of her purse among them, for
she felt how much at this moment she
needed the compassion of the meapest of
her species. They loaded her with bless.
ings, but shuddering at the name of
happiness with which their prayers were
filled, she hurried on. They entered on
a heath where temporary barracks for
the additional troops had been crected,
and here. Armida "felt her strength
begin to fail: she tottered to a shed where
some of the soldiers wives resided, and
when she was admitted sunk upon a
seat: Rosine bending over her, almost wish-
ed for the termination of her sufferings,
even on this desolate and deserted spot.
Some of the women who came from the
barracks, unconscious of Armida's interest
in the subject of their conversation, be-
gan to speak of the prisoner : Armida
shivered, but she did not utter a word :
some declared he would be pardoned

others spoke of his being ordered to im-
mediate execution, but all concurred in
compassion for the young officer who had
followed him to prison, and now stood by
his side, while he was on bis trial. There
was an old clergyman there too, they said,
who wept like a child.
Connal had not been deserted : Des-
mond, careless of his danger, and St.
Austin, in spite of his age and profession,
had followed the rebel to his triat. In
the few hours he was in confinement
Connal exhausted every topic of persua-
sion to induce Desmond to consult his
safety by concealing himself; but Des-
mond, whose heart was formed for affec-
tion, and who was at once deprived of
every object of it, without father, brother,
wife or child, and reduced to wish for
the death of Ines under her present hope-
less misery, listened with impatience to
the mention of life.

all over life; I see it is a desert; I turn
for shelter to the grave.”
And the court with deep compassion
saw a young officer, who had fought for
his country, overcome by fraternal affec-
tion, and domestic misfortune, stand by
the side of a convicted rebel, and call
upon the justice of his country for a
similar sentence.
It was evening, when two women rush-
ing into the shed announced that the
prisoner was acquitted ; a few minutes
after they were followed by a third, who,
overcome by what she had heard or seen,
sat down weeping bitterly:''at that sound

limbs, and quit the shed, and the women
then first perceiving the cause of her
distress, gathered round her with expres-
sions of pity :
“ God bless you! God bless you !"

but I know it too late !" and habitually
generous, she was about to divide her
purse among them, but her recent bounty
had exhausted it: she recollected that some
of the rich ornaments she had worn thie
preceding night were still on her person,
and in this extremity of her fate, grateful
even for menial pity, the proud daughter
of Lord Montclare was seen dividing in

ments in which she had glittered in the
view of princes.
They set out again, it was almost twi-
light, but they distinguished a number of
figures at a distance on the heath.
." He is pardoned !" shrieked Armida,
darting forward, “He is pardoned !” but
Rosine knew too well the fatal roll of the
drums, she saw too well the circle that
was forming among the distant figures:
she rushed before Armida, and with all
her strength attempted to turn her from
the sight. It was too late-the roar of the
musketry thundered over the heath, and

announced that Coppal bad met at least
with the fate of the brave. At the mo-
ment the soldiers drew their triggers, a
young man, bursting through the ranks,
threw himself on his knees beside Connal:
the impulse was so rapid that no one
could prevent it: the soldiers fired, and
- Desmond fell beside Connal.
St. Austin implored the commanding
officer to compel the soldiers and the
crowd to retire, and leave the bodies to
the care of some surviving friend : the
officer was a man of humanity, and he
complied. St. Austin stood by the corses
till he saw with horror Armida and
Rosine approach. Armida knelt on the
ground : a single glance distinguished the
brothers. Connal lay calm as if in sleep;
Desmond's more impetuous spirit had
left an expression of defiance in the fea-
tures that were stern in the fixedness of
death.
“Noblest of men! here we are at
length united !" cried Armida, sinking

on her knees : “ we are at length united,
and I am worthy to be your bride : on
the damp and bloody ground, with the
corse of a rebel in my arms, I would not
resign my place for empires: here is my
· last seat, and here I am more exalted
than when I received the homage of a
false world !"
· Rosine and St. Austin stood at a dis-
tance : they did not interrupt this solemn
scene, but by their audible and agoni-
zing sobs.
Suddenly the noise of a carriage was
heard approaching, and Lady Montclare
springing from her splendid equipage
knelt on the earth beside her daughter, and
implored with maternal tenderness, felt too
late, to return with her and be reconciled
to life. It was then St. Austin felt it his
duty to approach, and admonish the
criminal, and console the sufferer: it was
too late. Lady Montclare in the despair
of sudden repentance was insensible to

every thing but the sight of her sacrificed
daughter; and Armida, on whom the
effect of the poison had been accelerated
by her mental sufferings, was no longer
capable of any sensation but that she
clasped the corse of Condal in her arms.
At that moment a tumult among the
servants who attended Lady Montclare
announced something they attempted to
prevent, but could not : it was Ines.
Since her last view of Desmond she had'
become so intractable that pothing but
the presence of her mother could restrain
ber, and compelled to quit the castle in
search of Armida, she had been unable to
leave Ines behind her. The moment
her mother quitted the 'carriage she
attempted to follow her: her screams
and struggles terrified the servants into
submission, and rushing forward she dis-
covered the corse of Desmond before it
was possible to prevent her flying to it,
and clasping it with a force no mortal
hand could sever.

The wretched mother at the saine mo-
ment saw both her children in the arıns
of death, clinging to the remains of the
chosen of their hearts : Armida was silent,
but Ines raved with the piercing eloquence
of madness.
" Here the wanderer rests !” she cried :
* see how calm he lies, he speaks to me
though you cannot hear his voice; but
the world cannot persuade me that those
lips do not move when I speak to him.
" Can this be death ! oh, how the fools
who dread it are deceived : never was
life so lovely! Is he indeed dead? Why
should not the dead love? Oh, we will
be so happy in the grave, we will sit on
the blue tomb-stones, and sing songs all
night, and when my babe is chilled, the
moon shall shine on it, and warm it, and
we will make bredes of the church-yard
flowers; and the skulls and bones will
serve, us for tokeos of love, and when

grayes, we will bid them be merry

with us. Why should not the dead love,
when death is so lovely!”
Lady Montelare, unable to support
this sight, desired her servants to remove
Ines ; they approached, and Ines, ex-
hausted by her ravings, sunk into their
arms; but as they bore her to the car-
riage, a shriek, such as never come
from human lips but in the agonies of
death, announced that her sufferings bad
ceased.
Rosine and St. Austin continued to
watch by Armida, though the night had
shut in: she never uttered a word, she
never heaved a sigh; her glazed eye ex-
pressed no consciousness, and the firmness
with which her arms were wreathed round
the neck of Connat seemed rather the
result of some mechanical cause, than the
movement of a voluntary agent. It was
midnight, when by accident a musket-shot
was discharged at some distance: the
flash on the night, the echo on the beath,
by awaking the image of Connal's fate,

restored her faculties for a moment: .
that accident operating with the crisis of
the poison, she half rose from the ground:
her convulsed arms released Connal from
their grasp, she pressed them to her heart
with a scream of agony, and expired.
St. Austin and Rosine still reside near
the deserted castle, for Indy Montclare
has hid her crimes and her remorse in
some convent.
They often wander on the spot where
the lovers rest together; they remember
their virtues, their charms, and their
misfortunes: life grows barren to their
view while they talk of them, but the
world to which they are gone brightens
in the contrast.
There is an ash-tree that grows near
their graves : Rosine loves to sit under its
shade, and hear the evening wind murmur
through its branches: the thoughts
that visit her there elevate her heart,
while they fill her eyes with tears; and
she feels that even grief, refined by

all the joys of mortality. When the
darkness warns her home, she casts her
eye as she departs on the simple inscrip-
tion placed by St. Austin on the grave,
