any other that falls on human ear. Like one who, spur-
ring from the battle-ﬁeld, proclaims, “ The ﬁght is ours, but
our great chief is slain !" there is sorrow in that message
of good tidings ;-and not only for pious Christian folk ; in
every bosom it stirs some sleeping memory, and reminds
it of the days that are no more. N o wonder, then, that
such music should touch my lady’s heart—the widowed
mistress of Mirk Abbey. Those Christmas-bells which
are also wedding-bells, remind her doubtless of the hour
when Sir Robert lifted her lace-veil aside, and kissed her
brow before all the people in the little church by the sea,
and called her for the ﬁrst time his wife. He will never
do so more. He has been dead for years. But what of
that? Our dead are with us still. Our acts, our dealings
with the world, form but a p0rti0n of our lives ; our
thoughts still dwell with those dear ones who have gone
home before us, and in our dreams they still are our com-
panions. My lady is not alone in her private chamber,
although no human being is there besides herself. Her
eyes are ﬁxed upon the ﬁre, and in its flame she sees a
once-loved face invisible to others, whose smile has power
to move her even to tears. How foolish are those
who ascribe romance to Youth alone—to Youth, that has
scarcely learned to love, far less to lose ! My lady is
ﬁve-and-forty at the least, although still comely; and yet
there are memories at work within that broad while brow,
which, for interest and pathos, outweigh the fancies of a
score of girls. Even so far as we—the world—are ac-
quainted with her past, it is a strange one, and may well
give her that thoughtful air.
Lady Lisgard, of Mirk Abbey, has looked at life from a.
far other station than that which she now occupies. When
a man of fortune does not materially increase his property
by marriage, we call the lady of his choice, although she
may have a few thousand pounds of her own, “a girl
without a. Sixpence.” But Sir Robert Lisgard did literally
make a match of this impecunious sort. Moreover, he
married a very “ unsuitable young person 3 " by which ex-

pression you will understand that he was blamed, not for
choosing a bride very much junior to himself, but for not
selecting her from the proper circles. When accidentally
interrogated by blundering folks respecting her ancestry,
the baronet used good-humouredly to remark, that his
wife was the daughter of Neptune and Thetis. When
asked for her maiden name, he would reply drin : “ She
was a Miss Anna Dyomene 3” for the simple fact was,
that she had been thrown up almost at his feet by the
sea—the sole survivor of a crowded emigrant-ship that
went to pieces before his eyes while he was staying one
stormy autumn at a sea-side village in the south. Lashed
to a spar, the poor soul came ashore one terrible night in
avery insufﬁcient costume, so as to excite the liveliest
compassion in all beholders. There was a subscription
got up among some visitors of fashion to supply her with
a wardrobe; and they do say that Sir Robert Lisgard’s
name is still to be seen set down with the rest of the
benevolent donors, for ﬁve pounds, in the list that is kept
among the archives of the village post-ofﬁce.
But it was not until three years afterwards that he
bought her a trousseau; for the baronet, intending to
make her his wife not only in name—a companion for
life, and not a plaything, which is prized so long as it is
new, and no longer—caused Lucy Gavestone, during the
greater part of that interval, to be educated for her future
position. If it was madness in him, as many averred, to
marry so far beneath him, there was much method in his
madness. Not ashamed of her as a bride, he was re-
solved not to be ashamed of her as the mistress of his
house, or as the mother of his children, if it should please
Heaven to grant him issue. It was in France, folks said,
that her ladyship acquired those manners which subse-
quently so excited the envy of the Midland county in
which she lived. She bore the burden of the honours
unto which she was not born as gracefully as the white
rose in her blue-black hair. But to perform her loving
duties as a mother, in the way even her enemies admitted

that she did perform them, could scarcely have been
learned in France. Only love and natural good sense
could have taught her those. Never once had Sir Robert
Lisgard cause to regret the gift which the sea had given
him. He used, however, smilineg to remark, in his later
years—and his words were not without their pathos then—
that he wished that he could have married his Lucy
earlier, and while he was yet a. young man; but in that
case she would have been ﬁtter for the font than the
altar, inasmuch as there was a. quarter of a century
between their respective ages. He always averred that ﬁve-
and-twenty years of his manhood had been thrown away.
But good wife and matron as Lady Lisgard had been,
she was no less excellent a widow and mother. 1f Sir
Robert could have risen from that grave in Mirk church-
yard, where he had preferred to lie, rather than in the
family vault, so that she might come to visit him in his
lonely sleep, and daily lay a ﬂower or two, culled with her
own hands, upon him not perhaps unconscious of that
loving service—he would have found all things at the
Abbey as he would have wished them to be during life :
that is, so far as she could keep them so. Sir Richard,
their eldest son, was within a few months of his majority,
and, of course, had become in a great degree his own
master; not that he misused his years so as to place
himself in opposition to his mother, for he was a gentle-
man above everything; but he was of a disposition
more haughty and stern than her kindly nature could
well cope with, and she nervously shrank from any
contest with it, although, on a question of principle—
which, however, had not occurred—she might have
braved even him.
Walter Lisgard, the younger son, was as genial and
good-humoured as his father before him, and although (in
common with every one who knew her) I loved and
respected my lady, it must be confessed that he was too
openly his mother’s favourite, as he was the favourite of
all at Mirk, in the Abbey or out of it.

Lastly, there was Letty Lisgard—but she shall speak
for her sweet self. While her mother sits and thinks
before her ﬁre, there is a knock at the chamber-door, and
on the instant the picture in her brain dissolves, which
was atfecting her so deeply, and she has no eyes save for
her only daughter. A girl of seventeen enters the room,
not gaily, as would have become her age, but with a
certain gentle gravity that becomes her at least as well,
since it is impossible to imagine that she could look more
lovely. Fair as a lily, but not pale, for her usually delicate
colour is heightened by some mental emotion, which
causes, too, the little diamond cross upon her bosom to
rise and fall, and the hazel eyes to melt and glitter beneath
their dark lashes ; lithe and a tall as a sapling wooed too
roughly by the north wind, she glides in, with her fair
head slightly bowed, and casting herself upon her knees
beside my lady, exclaims—“ Ah, do not weep, dear
mother—do not weep l” at the same time herself bursting
into apassion of tears. “I knew what you would be
thinking of,” continues she, “upon this sad night, and
therefore I came to comfort you a little, if I could. If
not a merry Christmas, let me at least wish you a happy
one, my own dear mother. I am sure that if dear papa
can see us now, he wishes you the same.”
“ Yes, dearest Letty, that is true. How thoughtful and
kind it was of you to leave your friend—breaking off, no
doubt, some pleasant chat over school-days "
“ Nay, mother,” interrupted the girl ; “ what is Rose to
me in comparison with you? Was it likely that I should
forget this anniversary of our common loss !”
Lady Lisgard did not answer in words, but shedding
by the wealth of golden brown hair that had fallen over
her daughter’s forehead, she kissed that pure brow tenderly.
Upon her own checks, a. crimson ﬂush, called thither by
the young girl’s words, was lingering yet. Reader, happy
are you if you have never known a loving voice say:
“What are you thinking of, dearest?” expecting to re-
ceive the answer: “Of you," when you have no such

reply to give—when your mind has been wandering far
from that trustfulbeing, and perhaps even whither it should
not have wandered. Such a ﬂush may then have visited
your cheeks, as now touched those of Lady Lisgard,
although it is certain that memory never played her so
false as to remind her of aught whereof she need have
been ashamed. The fact was, she had not been thinking
of Sir Robert at all, albeit it was upon that very day, ﬁve
years back, that she had received from his failing hand
its last loving pressure, and in that very room. Human
nature cannot be trained like those wondrous mechanical
inventions of the monks, that indicated the fasts and
festivals of the Church so accurately—to suffer or rejoice
at particular times and seasons; we are often sad when
the jest is upon our lips, and bear a light heart beneath
the sackcloth. Lady Lisgard’s thoughts had, Heaven
knew, been far from merry ones ; but because she had not
been mourning with chronological propriety, her woman’s
heart unjustly smote her with a sense of want of fealty to
the memory of him for whom she still wore—and intended
to wear to her dying day—the visible tokens ofregrct.
It is the fashion to jeer at widows; but to a reverent
mind, there are few things more touching than that
frequent sight in honest England—a widowed mother,
whose only joy seems to be in what remains to her of her
(lead lover, husband, counsellor—his children ; and the
only grief that has power to wring whose heart, past sense
of common pain through the dread anguish that it has
once undergone, arises from their misfortunes and mis-
doings. Ah, selﬁsh boy, beware how you still further
burden that sorrow-laden soul l—ah, thoughtless girl, ex-
change not that faithful breast too hastily for one that
may spurn your head in the hour of need !
My lady—for that was what we always called her
about Mirk—was neither more nor less fortunate with her
children than most mothers. They all three loved her 3
but they did not all love one another. Between Sir
Richard and Walter was only a year of time, but upon

it had arisen a thousand quarrels. The former thought
that the privilege of an elder brother was a divine right,
extending over every circumstance of fraternal life; the
latter conceived it to be an immoral institution, borrowed
in an evil hour from the Jews, and one to be strictly kept
within its peculiarlimits—themselves more than sufﬁciently
comprehensive—the inheritance of the family title, and
the succession to the landed estates. '
“Where are Richard and Walter, Letty P” asked Lady
Lisgard, breaking a long silence. “ They, too, have been
always mindful, like yourself, of this sad day."
“They are mindful still, dear mother. I hear Walter’s
foot in the corridor. even now."
A swift elastic footfall it was, such as is very sugges
tive of the impulsive nature of him who uses it; for a
phlegmatic man may move swiftly on rare occasions—such
as bayonets behind him, or a mad bull—but there will be
no more elasticity in his gait, even then, than in that of a
walking-doll ; whereas every step of Captain Walter
Lisgard had a double action, a rise and fall in it, inde-
pendent of the progressive motion altogether.
He was of a slim, yet not delicate build ; his every
movement (and, as I have said, there was plenty of it) had
a. native grace like that of a child; childlike and trust-
ful, too, were those blue eyes ; soft in their expression as
his sister’s, while he stooped down to kiss his mother’s
cheek, scarce more smooth than his own. Upon his lip,
however, was a fairy moustache, which being, fortu-
nately, coal-black like his somewhat close-cropped hair,
made itself apparent to all beholders,_and rescued his
comeliness from downright effeminacy. But no woman
ever owned a softer voice, or could freight it with deeper
feeling than Walter Lisgard.
“God bless you, dearest mother, and give you all the
good you deserve !" murmured he tenderly.
“And God bless you, my darling ! " answered Lady
Lisgard, holding him at the full distance of her white
and rounded arms, clasped with two cestly jewels, which

had a worth, however, in her eyes far beyond their price,
being Sir Robert’s wedding-gift. “Ah, me ! how you re-
mind me of your father’s picture, Watty, taken on the
day when he came of age. I trust you will grow up to be
like him in other respects, dear boy."
“I hope so, mother; although,” added he, with a
sudden petulancy, “there will be a vast difference be-
tween us in some things, you know. He was an only
son, whereas I am not even an eldest one ,' and when 1
come of age, there will be no picture taken, nor any fuss
made, such as is to happen in June, I hear, upon
Richard’s majority.”
“ Walter, Walter!" exclaimed Lady Lisgard reprovingly
—“ this is not like yourself, for it’s envious—and—and
covetous ! "
“At all events, it is very foolish, mother,” interrupted
the young man drin ; “ for what can’t be cured must be
endured.”
“And very, very cruel to me. added" Lady Lisgard.
“ Then I am sincerely sorry I spoke,” returned Walter
hastily, the moodiness upon his features chased away at
once by loving regret. “ Only, when a fellow leaves his
regiment to spend Christmas Eve at home—as I am sure
I was delighted to do, so far as you and Letty were
concerned—he does not want to ﬁnd there another
commanding ofﬁcer, uncommissioned and self ap-
pointed . . . .”
“Walter, Walter! this is very sad,” broke in Lady
Lisgard piteously: “ you know what is Richard’s man-
ner, and how much less kind it is than his true meaning.
Can you not make some allowance for your own
brother i’ ”
“That’s exactly what I said to him, mother,” answered
Walter, laughing bitterly. “Here have I just got my
troop, with no more to 'keep myself on than when I was
a comet, and had no back debts to speak of; and yet, so
far from helping me a little, as Richard might easily do,
by making some allowance for 111': mm llrol/irr, he corn-

plains of that which you are so good as to let me have
out of your own income; Why, that’s not 111': business,
if it were twice as much—although, I am sure, dear
mother, you are liberality itself. Has he not got enough
of his own—and of what should be mine and Letty’s
here, by rights—without grudging me your benevo-
lences? Is he not Sir Richard Lisgard of Mirk
Abbey? ”
“I will not listen to this, Walter,” cried his mother
sternly. “This is mere mean jealousy of your elder
brother.” .
“Oh, dear no, mother; indeed, it is not that,”
answered the young man coldly. “I envy him nothing.
I hold him superior to me in no respect whatever; and
that is exactly why I will not submit to his dictation.
Here he comes stalking along the gallery, as though con-
scious that every foot of oak belongs to him, and every
picture on the wall.”
It was undoubtedlya ﬁrm determined step enough—-
unusually so, for one so young as Sir Richard. The
face of the new-comer, too, was stern almost to harsh-
ness ; and as he entered the room, and beheld Walter
standing by his mother’s side, his features seemed to
stiffen into stone. A ﬁne face, too; more aristocratic if
not so winning as his younger brother’s, and not with-
out considerable sagacity: if his manner was not grace-
ful, it had a high chivalric air about it which beﬁtted his
haughty person very well. When he taught himself
submission (a rare lesson with him), as now, while he
raised his mother’s ﬁngers to his lips, and kissed them
with dutiful devotion, it would have been hard to ﬁnd
a man with a more noble presence than Richard
Lisgard.
“A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you,
mother." The words, though conventional, had an earnest
kindness, which came from the heart. Lady Lisgard
kissed him fondly.
“Thank you, dear Richard," said she; “but, alasl no

Christmas can be a merry one, no year a happy one, when
I see my children disagree."
“Ah, Master Walter has been here before me, I see,”
quoth Sir Richard bitterly, “stealing, like Jacob, his
mother’s blessing from her ﬁrst-born, and giving his own
account of matters. But please now to listen to my
version."
“ Not to-night, Richard," exclaimed Lady Lisgard with
deep emotion. “ Let not to-night, sacred to the memory
of your common father, be a witness to your mutual
accusations. In this room, almost at this very hour,
but a few years back, he died, bequeathing you with
his last breath to my tenderest care. Here it was that
you kissed his white lips, weary with prayers for your
future welfare; here it was that you promised, in return,
to be good and dutiful sons. I know—I think, at least
~—that you both love your mother. No, I will kiss
neither of you while thus unreconciled. That was not
all that he required of you ; he would have hidden you,

to those bells, that seem to strive to beat their message
into the most stubborn ears. Do you not hear what

The young girl lifted up her head from her mother’s
lap, to gaze into her eyes 3 then, with exquisite pathos
and softness, repeated, like a silver peal of bells: “ Peace
and good-will, peace and good-will, peace and good-will
to all mankind."
Sir Richard looked at his brother ﬁxedly, but no longer
in wrath. “It is my part to make the ﬁrst advance,"
said he, “although I was not the ﬁrst to quarrel ;” and
he frankly stretched forth his hand.
- The other paused a second; then reading on his
mother’s anxious lips: “For my sake, Walter," he
grasped his brother's ﬁngers. There was grace in the
very delay, as in the motion tenderness and genial

CHAPTER II.
THE \VAITS.
> NCE more my lady is alone, except for her
companion-thoughts, which are, however, no
longer of a distressing nature. The reconcile-
ment of her boys has gladdened her to the
core: she thinks, she trusts at least, that the truce will
be a lasting peace. As for Letty, she is all that a
mother’s heart could wish her to be. If much is lost
to my lady, surely much remains. With the poor, one
misery is removed only to bring another into greater
prominence; but with the rich, this is not so. Only let
the disease be cured, or the quarrel be made up, which
is at present vexing them, and all, for a time at least,
is sunshine. Even not to be cold, not to be hungry, is
something; and not to have to take thought of the
morrow is a great deal. From her warm and curtained
chamber, Lady Lisgard looks forth into the night. The
snow falls as fast as ever, now straight, now aslant, now
whirled in circular eddies by the bitter north. Through
its thick and shifting veil, she can scarcely see the old
church-tower of Mirk, though it stands close by within
the very garden grounds of the Abbey,- nor the wind-
mill which crowns Mirkland Hill, and on moonlit nights
stands up so clear against the sky, a beacon to all the
country around. It was weather which those who are
armed against it call “Seasonable 3" and some of the

tender sex, who have a ﬁre lit in their rooms before they
rise, and go out in seal-skin and travel with foot-warmers,
even go so far as to call “ Delightful." At all events, it
is such as is pleasant to watch from within for a few mo-
ments, and then to return to one's ﬁreside with enhanced
satisfaction.
There are merry-makers in the kitchen to-night, as
beﬁts the season, and my lady’s maid has been enjoined
not to hurry herself. Her mistress is beginning to un-
robe, without her assistance, but very leisurely. She
unclasps one warm and sparkling jewel from her arm,
and gazes thoughtfully, but far from sadly, upon the
picture that is hid within it. It is the miniature of a
handsome man past middle age, attired in a blue coat
and gold buttons ; what persons of my lady’s age would
call a decidedly old-fashioned portrait; but it is the like-
ness of Sir Robert as her bridegroom. “ What a good,
kind husband he was," thinks she. “ How he loved
me, and loaded me with favours; how much he over-
looked, how much he forgot — of which others know
nothing—for my sake. How terrible would it be to feel
that one had not done one’s poor duty in return for so
much love. Thank Heaven, I feel free from any such
charge. If I had not love—that is,ﬁrst love—to give him in
exchange, I gave him all I had. I gave him genuine affec-
tion, esteem—worship. Everybody knows that ; and what
is better, my own heart knows it. It never beat with truer
fealty towards him than it beats to-night. God knows. I live
for his children only. What a ﬁne noble boy is Richard
grown; surely, to look upon him, and to say to one’s
self: ‘This is my son,’ should be happiness enough for
any mother. True, he is proud; but has he not some-
thing to be proud of P He, Sir Richard, and one of those
Lisgards who have ruled at Mirk for twelve generations.
(Here a quiet smile stole over my lady’s features.) They said
with reason at those tableaux at the Vanes, that with that
helmet on he was the image of young Sir Maurice, who
died at Edgehill with the colours twisted round him. I

wonder if it was his poor mother who had her'dead boy
painted so. ’Tis certain that she thought: ‘ Ah, were he
but alive, there would be no such thing as sorrow more
for me.’ Yet here I have him. Ah (here she grew as
pale as death), why did I ever let my Walter be a
soldier? What weakness to give way—to the very peril
of him for whom I was so weak ! He would have gone
to the wars themselves but for good Dr. Haldane, through
whom (thanks to the duke) he was not gazetted to the
corps he had applied for. Why did he not choose the
bar, like his elder brother? How he would have moved
men's hearts to mercy with that winning tongue! Or
why did he not become God’s messenger—I am sure he
has an angel’s face—and carry the news those bells are
telling of to shipwrecked souls? Oftentimes, when, as a
child, he knelt beside me to say his prayers, his very
looks have seemed to make the action more sacred.
Goodness seemed better worth when he was praying for
it, and heaven no home for saints unless he shared it!
God grant that he may grow up a good man!
“Then Letty, too—~what mothers wealth must I pos- .
sess since that sweet girl is not the chief of it, the central
jewel of my crown? When matched with others of her
age—with this Rose Aynton, for example—how bright
and fair she shows! Not but that Rose is a good girl,
doubtless ; accomplished, too, beyond her years, and far
beyond her opportunities—she sparkles like a crystal cut
in ten thousand facets 3 but my own Letty is the ﬂawless
diamond, bright and pure as light itself. What blessings
are these three! May Heaven keep them always as I
deem them now. I wish my Walter were a little less im-
pulsive ; but the darling boy is young. As for dear
Richard, I have no fears for him. The proud lad will

startled you; but I knocked twice, and could not make
you hear."
“ It was not you, Mary, that startled me,” returned
Lady Lisgard; “it was the sudden music. The Christ-
mas waits, as I suppose ?"
“ Yes, my lady. They came up from the village a
little while. ago, and have been staying in the servants’-
hall for the clock to strike twelve.”
“ I trust they have all had supper? ”
“You may be sure of that, my lady. Mrs. Welsh is
as openhanded (with your ladyship's property) as any
cook in the county; nor is George Steve a likely man to
sit thirsty while he sees others drink. One would think
that a publichouse-keeper should have drinking enough
at home; but —pard0n, my lady—I am making com-
plaints which, however just, I know you dislike to hear,
and, be51des, I am interrupting the carol.”

16 M'rk Abbey.
Lady Lisgard moved to the window with a smile, and
drawing the curtain aside, threw up the sash. On the
white lawn beneath, stood ﬁve dark ﬁgures, bearing
various instruments of music, and one a huge horn
lantern, the light of which glinted upon the laurels. It
was impossible to recognise the features of the rest, as
they stood cap in hand, notwithstanding the still driving
snow, aWaiting her ladyship’s reply; but she addressed
them each by name nevertheless.
“Mr. Steve, I thank you kindly. Henry Ash, I am
glad to ﬁnd you in good voice again. John Lewis and
Peter Stone—if I am not mistaken. Neighbours and
friends all, I thank you very much. But it is a cold
night for caroling, and I hope you have been taken care
of within. A merry Christmas to you and a happy New
Year." There was a tremor in my lady’s voice, although
she spoke with such particularity, which showed how
deeply she was moved.
"‘God bless your ladyship,” returned the voices, dis-
orderly as to unison, but each one of itself distinct and
clear as ﬁle-ﬁring.—“ God bless Sir Richard, and send
him'a fair bride—God bless Master Walter’s handsome
face—God bless Miss Letty."
Lady Lisgard closed the window, but as she did so,
dropped the heavy curtain between herself and the lighted
chamber, so that she could still look out, but without
being seen. The curtain, too, cut her off from the ob-
servation of her maid within. “Who is the ﬁfth man that
bears the lantern, Mary?“ asked her ladyship in a tone
of carelessness, very unsuited to the expression of her
face, which all in a moment had grown pinched and
terror-stricken, as though it hungered for some reply that
it yet dreaded to hear.
“Nobody as you know, my lady, nor indeed as I
know, for the matter of that. He’s a stranger in these
parts, who’s putting up at the Lirgard Arms. He only
came for a few days last week, walking across the country
for all the world like a pedler—a way he says he learned

in foreign parts; but Steve with his odd ways has taken
his fancy, so that he stays on. A very well-spoken sort
of person he is too, although the sea, it seems, has been
his calling, which is a rough trade. However, he has
made it answer—according at least to Mr. Steve. Any
way he ﬁings his money about free enough, and indeed is
what I call rather too fond of treating folks. He is good
company himself, they say, and a favourite with every-
body he comes across, which is a very dangerous thing
—that is," added Mistress Forest, correcting herself,
“unless one is a gentleman, like handsome Master
Walter."
“You don't—remember—this—this person’s name,
Mary, do you?” asked Lady Lisgard.
“No, strange to say, I don’t, my lady; althouin but
a moment ago itwas on the tip of my tongue. It is some-
thing like Hathaway."
A trace of colour once more returns to my lady’s
cheek, and her breath, which, by reason perhaps of the
conﬁned space in which she stands, has seemed to be
stiﬂed during the narration of her maid, now comes and
goes with a little less of effort.
“That is his voice, I reckon, my lady—yes, I thought
so—and the new carol which he has been teaching the
choir.”

Now where Tigris swells with rains,

“Ah, now I’ve got it, my lady,” cried Mistress Forest
triumphantly. “It isn't Hathaway. He‘s the man they

windmill of old Daniels, and that was how I confused

My lady’s dimpled hand ﬂew to her heart, and would
have pressed against it had she any strength to do so.
Her limbs, however, were nerveless, and shook as if she
had the ague. But for the window-seat, she must have
dropped ,' and as it was, leaned, huddled up against it, a
shapeless form, decked in gray satin and pearls indeed,
but as unlike my lady as those poor wretches whom we
strangle for a show are unlike themselves, who seem to
lose, the instant that the fatal bolt is drawn, all fellowship
with the human, and become mere bundles of clothes. The
drop had fallen, and without warning, from under Lady
Lisgard’s feet, but unhappily the victim was conscious,
and not dead.

CHAPTER III.
ONLY “ THE HEART."
GNORAN T of the ruin it had wrought, the rich
full voice of the stranger still rang forth, mani-
festly to the admiration of the conﬁdential
maid, since her nimble tongue failed to inter-
rupt its melody. She was not displeased that her lady
too was listening with such unbroken attention, and pro-
bably also looking out upon the singer; for Mr. Derrick
was a very “proper man "—atall events in external appear-
ance—and had shown himself in the servants-hall awhile
ago by no means unconscious of the personal charms of
Mistress Forest, which, although mature, were still by no
means despicable. A few years younger than my lady
herself, Mary had been treated by time at least with equal
courtesy; her ﬁgure was plump, her eyes were bright, her
voice, which, if not absolutely musical, could reach some
very high notes, and upon occasion, was clear and cheery.
One would have said she would have been too talkative
to have suited my lady’s grave and quiet ways; but this
was not so. Lady Lisgard had that blessed gift of being
able not to listen unless it pleased her to do so, which
enables so many conscientious persons to speak favour-
ably of sermons; all the avalanche of her maid’s
eloquence passed clean over her head, and suffered her
to pursue her own meditations at the easy tribute of an
appreciating nod when all was ended. Even had she

been much more inconvenienced by the débris of words,
her tormentor would have been freely forgiven. The af-
fection between mistress and maid was deep and genuine,
and had extended over more than half their lifetime.
Mary Forest was the daughter of a ﬁsherman at
Coveton, the village on whose sandy beach Sir Robert
had picked up his bride. To old Jacob Forest’s cottage,
the human ﬂotsam and jetsam had been conveyed, and
upon Mary, then almost a child, had much of its tending
at ﬁrst devolved. The kindly little nurse soon won the
regard of her patient, cut off by that one_night’s storm from
kith and kin, for this emigrant ship had contained all that
were near or clear to her on earth, and ready as a babe
to clasp the tendrils of love about whoever showed her
kindness. Removed from the cottage to the rectory,
where the clergyman and his wife welcomed her very
hospitably, ﬁrst, as a. poor human waif, that claimed some
lodgment ere she could decide upon her future calling,
for a short time after that as their nursery governess, and
ﬁnally as guest and inmate pending those arrangements
of her betrothed husband which subsequently took her to
France, Lucy Gavestone—for that was the ‘name by
which my lady was then known—did not forget little
Mary and her loving ministrations. She asked and easily
obtained permission of Sir Robert that the girl should
accompany her to the semi-scholastic establishment at
Dijon in which he had decided to place her previous to
their marriage. This she accordingly did ; and many a '
strange reminiscence unshared by others (itself a great
knitter of the bond of friendship) had mistress and maid
in common. The fortunes of the latter of course rose
with those of the former, and of all the household of
Mirk Abbey there was none in higher trust than Mary
Forest, nor more certain of the envied position she held,
since the affection of my lady set her above the
machinations of that Nemesis of favourite servants, a
Domestic Cabal. Those natural enemies, the butler and
the cook, had even shaken hands together for the purpose

of compassing Mary’s downfall, but their combined en-
deavours had only obtained for a reward her sovereign
forgiveness and (I am afraid I must add) contempt.
In a word, Mary Forest was as happy in her circum-
stances as any woman at her time of life could expect to
be whose title of “ Mistress ” was only brevet rank. She
had subjugated many other male folks beside the butler
(the ancient coachman, for example, with the back view
of whose broad shoulders and no neck the Lisgard family
had been familiar for half a century), but such victories
had not at all been owing to her charms. By them,
hitherto, man had been an unconquered animal, and this
was the knot in the otherwise smooth surface of Mary's
destiny which no amount of planning (within her phi-
losophy) could make even. She had been wooed, of
course (what woman of twoscore, according to her own
account, has not P), but hitherto the suitors had not been
eligible, or her own ideas had been too ambitious. The
time had now arrived with her when compromise begins
to be expedient, and high expectations abate. Matri-
monial opportunities at the Abbey were few and far
between. She had not received such marked attention
from anybody for months as this stranger, living upon his
own means at the Lz'sgard Arms, had paid her that very
night in the servants’-hall. No wonder, then, that while
he sang, she should for once be content to be a listener.
O’er the hill and o’er the vale
Each king bears a present;
Wise men go a child to bail,
Monarchs seek a peasant;
And a star in front proceeds,
Over rocks and rivers leads,
Shines with beams incessant.
Therefore onward, onward still,
Ford the stream, and climb the hill—
Love makes all things pleasant.
“There, now, I call that very pretty, my lady,” ex-
claimed Mistress Forest, as the last cadence died away;

“ and a very pretty sentiment at the end—‘ Love makes
all things pleasantg’ although for my part, I know no-
thing about tﬁaf, thank Heaven, and prefer to be my own
mistress—that is, with the exception of your ladyship, to
obey whom is a labour of love. ‘ I am sure there are few
husbands for whom I would give up such a service as
yours, my lady. I wish Mr. What’s-hissname—dear me,
how stupid of me—ah, Derrick! It’s rather a pretty
name too ; don't you think so, my lady? Iwish this Mr.
Derrick would sing us another song. He has a very
beautiful voice, and I am sure his expression—don’t you
think so, my lady? Ahem. No; I hear them moving
off. Well, he will be in the choir to-morrow morning,
that's sure. Had you not better come to the ﬁre my
Ah, great Heaven ! Mistress, my dear darling mistress,
what is the matter? Let me ring for help ! ”
It was impossible to misunderstand my lady’s “No,
although it was not articulate. Huddled up, as I have
said, in the space between the curtain and the window-
seat, white and cold as the snow without, voiceless and
almost breathless as her maid found her upon venturing
to draw aside the heavy damask folds between them,
such a look of agonised apprehension yet shot from her
eyes as at once to prevent Mistress Forest from putting
her design with respect to the bell into effect ; nay, more,
having assisted my lady to the sofa, she rightly inter-
preted a second glance in the direction of the door, to
mean “Lock it,” and this she did even before arranging
the cushions, which would have been the ﬁrst action with
most persons of her class. Mary Forest, although a
babbler, was no fool, and she perceived immediately that
the distress which was agitating her beloved mistress
was at least as much mental as physical. Once before,
and. only once, she had known my lady to be what
females call “ overcome "—that was upon the eve of her
marriage with Sir Robert; there was much similarity
between the two attacks, but the present was far more
violent. In the ﬁrst instance, she had been told by her

ladyship that it was owing to “the heart,” which was
ﬁtting enough under her then circumstances—but now
when there was no bridegroom-expectant to ﬂutter that
organ, it did seem singular certainly. Doubtless her
mistress would speak presently, and aﬁord the fullest in-
formation; in the meantime there was nothing for it but
silence and sal volatile.
My lady’s eyes are closed, and her features pale and
still as marble, but her lips are a little parted. With her
white hands thus crosswise over her boscm, she looks,
thinks the conﬁdential maid—for all the world like that
Dame Lisgard in the chancel, by the side of whose
marble couch her twelve fair children kneel, and take
their mother’s ceaseless blessing. All twelve so near of
an age, and so marvellously alike, thanks to the skill of
the sculptor, that one would have thought the whole
dozen—but that four, as Mistress Forest has read in
Portmlr and Prodzgz'er, is the extreme limit—had made
their simultaneous arrival in the world. Stiﬁ' and cold
almost as marble are my lady’s limbs, blue-veined like it
and rounded; but by degrees, as Mary rubs them steadily,
their life returns.
“Thank you, thank you," murmurs her ladyship. “ I
feel better now; but ” (this with effort) “I wish to be
left alone.” '
“ Alone, my lady ! I dare not leave you thus, without
even knowing what ails you.”
“ Nothing ails me now, Mary—nothing." Lady Lis-
gard made a feint of smiling, but kept her eyelids shut.
She did not dare to let her maid read what was written
in her eyes.
“ Was it your poor heart, again, Madam? "
“Ay, my poor heart!” My lady was speaking truth
there. Among the thousand millions born to suffer on
this earth, there was not one upon that Christmas Eve in
mental agony more deep than hers. The blow received
had been so terrible and unexpected, that it had at ﬁrst
half stupiﬁed all feeling; the real torture was now com

mencing, when she was about to realise the full extent of
her injuries. Lady Lisgard was not without courage;
but she was no Indian warrior to desire a spectator of
such torments. “ I must be alone, dear Mary," repeated
she. “Be sure you breathe no word of this to anyone.
Say, however, that I am not very well. The cold when
I opened that window to the waits ”—-here she visibly
shuddered—“seems to have frozen me to the marrow——
you may tell them I have taken cold. I shall not be
down to breakfast.”
“And I should recommend you to stay indoors, my
dear (as I hope to persuade Miss Letty to do), although
it is Christmas Day," said Mary tenderly, as she made up
the ﬁre before leaving the room; “ for the church is far
from warm."
“ I shall not go to church,” said Lady Lisgard, with a
decision that reassured her attendant, and enabled her
to wish her mistress “good-night" without much appre-
hension.
" He will be in the choir to-morrow morning,” was the
thought which was crossing the minds of mistress and
maid at the same instant.

CHAPTER IV.
SIR RICHARD GAINS ms POINT.
DON’T know how it was in the monkish times
in England, but it appears that the keeping
of religious days —— always excepting the
Sabbath —— is not in accordance with the
genius of this country as it exists at present. By
general habit, we are devout, or certainly reverent! and
yet the majority seem unable to discriminate between a
fast and a festival. Christmas Day, for example, is kept
by the evangelical folks exactly like Sunday, which is
with them very much the reverse of a feast-day. With
the High Church people, again, it is a holiday, to be
enjoyed after a certain peculiar fashion of their own;
while the great mass of the population outrage both these
parties by treating half the day as a fast and the other
half as a festival. After morning church, it is generally
understood that one may enjoy one’s self—that is, within
the limit of the domestic circle. There is the rub. It is
not every disposition which can appreciate forfeits and
snap-dragon. My own respected grandfather used to
thank Heaven with much devotion that he had always
been a domestic man, who knew how to enjoy a peaceful
Christmas in the bosom of his family; but then he always
went to sleep immediately after dinner, and nobody ven-
tured to wake him until the servants came in to prayers,
after which he went to bed.

It is a pleasant sight, says Holy Writ, to see brethren
dwelling together in unity ,- but the remark would not
have been put on record had the spectacle been a very
common one. It is a sad confession to make, but I
think most of us must own that the “family gathering”
in the country, even at Christmas-tide, is not the most
agreeable sort of social entertainment. There is too
much predetermination to be jolly about such festivities,
too much resolution to put up with Polly's temper and
Jack’s rudeness, and to please grandpapa (who is funded)
at all hazards. When we ﬁnd ourselves in the up-train
again after that domestic holiday-week, we are not alto-
gether displeased that it is over, and secretly congratulate
ourselves that there has not been a row. I am, of course,
speaking of ordinary folks, such as the world is mainly
composed of, and not of such exemplary people as my
readers and myself. IVe have no family jealousies, no
struggles for grandpapa‘s favour, no difﬁculties in having
common patience with Polly, no private opinion—if he
was not our brother—about Jack ; no astonishment at
Henry’s success,‘no envy at Augusta’s prospects. But
with the majority of grown-up brothers and sisters, this
is not so. Since they parted from one another under the
paternal roof, their lines of life have diverged daily ; their
interests, so far from being identical, have become an-
tagonistic. Margaret is as nice as ever, but Penelope is
not a bit improved, and yet one must seem to be as glad
to see one as the other. One must not only forgive, but
forget; it is not (unhappily) necessary that we should be
polite, but we must be aﬁ’ectionate ; nay, we must not
only be aﬁ'ectionate—grandpapa will think it extremely
odd if we are not “ gushing."
The Lisgard family circle was not large, though, as we
have seen, there was room in it for disagreement; more-
over, there was not a “dead set " of domestic element, the
consanguinity being relieved by the presence of Miss
Rose Aynton. If grandpapa were wise this should always
be the case ; for it prevents Courtesy from taking leave of

the company, which she is only too apt to do, under
the mistaken notion that near relations can afford to do
without her. It was with no such intention, however,
that my lady had asked Miss Aynton to visit Mirk.
She would have thought it hard, indeed, if her two sons
could not have spent a week together under the same
roof without the presence of a stranger to prevent their
quarrelling. Rose had been a school-friend of Letty,
and the latter young lady had asked permission to invite
her young friend to the Abbey for Christmas. She had
no home of her own to go to, poor thing, having neither
father nor mother. She lived with her aunt, Miss Coly—
ﬁeld, a fashionable old lady in Mayfair, very popular
among her acquaintance, but a sort of person, not un-
common in that locality, whom it is not altogether
charming to reside with as a dependant Miss Aynton
was evidently accustomed to suppression. It made a
man positively indignant to see one whose youth and
intelligence entitled her to be the mistress of all who
approached her, so humble, so unegotistic, so grateful.
It was evident that she had plenty of natural good spirits,
and every faculty for enjoyment, if she had only dared
exhibit them. Her very accomplishments, which were
numerous, were timidly concealed, and peeped forth one
by one, almost, as it seemed, by compulsion. She might
have left Mirk, for instance, without a soul knowing of
her taste for ecclesiastical decoration, if it had not been
for a sore throat which prevented Letty from superintend-
ing the Christmas ornamentations in the chancel.
“Can’t you do it, my dear?” said Letty, a little
peevish at the disappointment, and hopeless that her
place could be satisfactorily ﬁlled by a London-bred girl
like Rose, who had never seen holly-berries except in the
greengrocers’ shops, or at the artiﬁcial ﬁorist’s. “ Now,
do try, and Richard and Walter will both help.”
“I will do my best, dear," this young lady had an-
swered simply. And never had anything so beautiful
been seen in the county, as was the result of her efforts.

28 Mrk Abbey.
So much was said of them that Letty had ventured to go
to church that morning, despite her ailment, and was as
earnest in her praise as any in the congregation. There
was no such thing as jealousy in her composition, and
the success of her friend was a genuine pleasure-to her.
“ Oh, mamma, you have missed such a sight ! ” cried
she, as Lady Lisgard made her ﬁrst appearance that
morning at the luncheon-table, looking a little grave and
pale, but gracious and digniﬁed as a queen in exile, as
usual. “ Not only the chancel, but the whole church a
perfect bower of evergreens, and everything so exquisitely
done ! The pillars, alternately lvy and laurel ; and under
the gallery, beautiful texts in holly-berries set in green.
As for the wall at the back of the altar—the decorations
there are such that it makes one cry to think they are
ever to be taken down again. Oh, I do hope you will
feel well enough, dear mamma, to come to church this
afternoon and see them."
“ Really, Lady Lisgard,” said Miss Aynton, blushing
deeply, and with her soft eyes looking very much inclined
to be tearful, “you must not believe all that Letty's kind-
ness induces her to say about me.”
“ Nay, but it’s true, mother," broke forth Sir Richard.
“I never could have dreamt of anything so beautiful
being made out of leaves and berries. The old church
looks enchanted, and Miss Aynton is the fairy that has
done it."
“Sir Richard suggested the centre design himself," re-
turned Rose gravely ; “and the fact is, I am nothing but
a plagiarist in the whole affair. Our curate in Park
Street gives himself up to ﬂoral religion, and dresses up
his church in a dozen different garbs according to the
season. I am one of its volunteer tiring-woman, and am
therefore accustomed to the business—that is all."
“It is very honest of you to tell us that, Rose,” said
my lady approvingly.
“ Yes, mamma," broke in Letty ; “but it was very
wicked of her not to tell Mr. Mosely, who came to

thank her in the churchyard after service. He actually
made an allusion to her in his sermon—talked about her
‘ pious hands.’ She never told lzim one word about this
London curate.”
Letty’s laugh rang merrily out as she thus twitted her
friend, but her brothers did not echo it. Neither of
them relished this mention of the Mayfair clergyman.
They had each in turn enjoyed that religious work, in
which they had been fellow-labourers with Miss Aynton,
and each perhaps ﬂattered himself that she had been
most pleased when his own ﬁngers were looping the
berries for her, or holding the ivy while she fastened it
in its place. Of course there was nothing serious be-
tween either of them and herself. Sir Richard would
naturally look higher for a bride than to the dependent
niece of a ﬁckle old woman of fashion; while as to
Walter, with his comparatively small fortune and expen-
sive tastes, it was absolutely necessary that he should
“marry money," and not mere expectations. Still, no
man is altogether pleased to hear that a young girl he
admires is engaged to somebody else ; and although this
had not been said of Rose, yet Mayfair curates are
dangerous persons, and church decoration (as they were
aware by recent experience) is a fascinating occupation
when indulged in by both sexes at the same time.
So Letty had all the laughter to herself.
“How strange it was to hear the people when they
ﬁrst came in,” continued she. “ Their ‘ Ohs !’ and ‘Ahs ! ’
and ‘Well I nevers !' were quite irrepressible.”
“Especially the gentleman in the gallery, who ex-
pressed his opinion that it was for all the world like May-
day," observed Walter slily. “Miss Aynton’s (hf-d’wuvre
reminded him, it seems, 'of Jack-in-the-Green.”
“ Yes, was it not shocking, mamma P " exclaimed Letty.
“He spoke quite loud. I shouldn’t suppose that the
creature had ever been in a church before. How he did
stare about him l”
“You must have been looking in his direction your-

self, Miss," returned the young dragoon, “as, indeed,
were all the female part of the congregation. We don’t
see such awful beards as his in Mirk Church every
Sunday."
“How touchy dear Walter is upon the subject of
beards," observed Letty demurely.
The captain’s smooth face coloured like a girl's, while
Miss Rose Aynton sought concealment in her pocket-
handkerchief. Even Lady Lisgard forced herself to smile
at the embarrassment of her handsome boy. But Sir
Richard did not smile; he was not on sufﬁciently good
terms with his younger brother to enjoy even so innocent
a joke at his expense.
“You have not yet seen this distinguished stranger, I
suppose, mamma?” resumed Letty, without whom—what
with Rose’s shyness and the coldness between the two
young men—the conversation would have languished
altogether.
“What stranger do you mean, my dear?” said my
lady coldly.
“Why, the man that came with the waits last night,
and sang beneath your window. Surely you must have
noticed his voice, so different from poor old Ash and
the rest of them.”
“Now you mention it, Letty, I think I did remark
that there was a strange singer among them. He had
a voice like Mr. Steve’s."
“Very probably, my dear mother,” observed Walter,
laughing; “ for they both use the same tuning-key—
the spigot. Steve is said to be quite jealous because
this gentleman from foreign parts can take two glasses
to his one, although it cannot be added that he doesn’t
show it. Steve can look like a Methodist parson when
he pleases, whereas his new friend has made a sacriﬁce
of his very countenance to Bacchus ; and yet he must
have been a handsome fellow at one time—Don’t you
think so, Miss Aynton?”
“ I really scarcely looked at him," returned the young

lady addressed. “I should hesitate to pass an opinion
upon this distinguished—"
“ Oh, Rose," interrupted Letty, archly ; “how dare
you l—Why, Walter, she told me herself, only ﬁve
minutes ago, while we were taking off our bonnets, that
she thought his expression ‘magniﬁcent,’ that was
her very word—and that she would like to take him in
chalks."
“I must confess,” said Rose, “ without venturing to
call it good-looking or otherwise, that his countenance,
artistically speaking, seems to me very striking. He is
just one of those wicked people, I fancy, in whom one
feels a sort of interest in spite of one’s selﬁ—Now, don’t
you think so, Sir Richard?"
“ My dear Miss Aynton,” returned the baronet with an
air of hauteur that neutralised the familiarity implied
by his words, “if this person has won your sympathy, he
is fortunate indeed; but I must say that I don’t see that
he deserves it. His beard, which is certainly a handsome
one,—has also—as it seems to me—the great advantage
of obscuring half his countenance. I confess, I think he
looks to be a scoundrel of the ﬁrst salt-water."
“ That’s what Rose means! " cried Letty, clapping her
hands. He's one of those dear handsome villains who
used to—ah, infest—yes, that’s the phrase—who used to
infest the Spanish Main. How charmingly mysterious
was the very place in which they carried on their pro-
fessionl If it was not for sea-sickness, I should like to
have had something to do in the Spanish Main myself. I
have not the shadow of a doubt that this Mr. Derrick—
evidently an assumed name—-What’s the matter, dearest
mother P "
My lady had uttered a low cry, such as is evoked by
sudden and acute physical pain.
“ Nothing, my love—nothing : it was a passing spasm,
nothing more. A tinge of my old rheumatism again, I
fear, which is a sign of old age, and therefore a malady I
do not wish to be taken notice of.—N ow, don’t distress

yourselves, my dears"—-for all had risen with looks of
genuine and affectionate anxiety, except Miss Aynton,
who had rapidly poured out a glass of wine. “ Thank you,
Rose; that was all I wanted. Nobody offered me any
sherry, so I thought I would try whether I could not ob-
tain it medicinally. What were you saying, Letty, about
this—this person P ”
“I was merely remarking that he had probably been
a bucanier, lnamma."
“ In other words, that he deserves hanging,” observed
Sir Richard grufﬁy. “I hope he will soon take himself
out of the parish, for we have got tipplers enough in it
already."
“ Dear, dear, dear! ” said Letty, sedately; “ to make
such an observation as that, just after mamma has been
craving for sherry! Besides, how can this gentleman
annoy you, Sir Richard? He isn't come here to dispute
the title, is he? "
My lady kept her lips closed this time ,' but an anguish
passed over her face that would have been easy to see,
had not the eyes of those at table been otherwise engaged.
Letty was looking at her friend, in hopes that she
should get her to laugh at her high and mighty brother 5
Rose did not dare look up, for fear she should do 50.
Walter, his handsome lips slightly curled, was con-
temptuously watching the baronet, who stared, Sphinx-
Iike, right before him, as was his custom whenever he
was in one of his autocratic humours, as at present.
“Idon’t choose to have persons of that sort in the
parish,” said he, with icy distinctness.
“ But, my dear Richard, you can’t turn him out,"
reasoned Letty, rather vexed by an exhibition of her
brother’s pride before her school-friend beyond what she
had calculated upon. “He has a right to stop at the
Litigam’ Arms as long as he pleases."
“ And 1' have a right to turn Steve out as a tenant ”
“You have nothing of the kind, Richard," interposed
Walter, quietly: “you have no more right than I—not

even legal right, for the inn is not yet yours, and as for
moral right, it would be the most monstrous piece of
territorial oppression ever heard of out of Poland. So
long as the man behaves himself ——”
“He does not behave himself,” put in Sir Richard
angrily. “ He is a drunkard, and a brawler in church.”
“Gracious mercy! how you must have been looking
up Burn’s/usticz. But you will not be a magistrate, a
cur/0: rotu/orum, till you are of age, remember, so that he
is safe for six months. In the meantime, he certainly
means to stay here. He is so good as to say he likes
Mirk, I understand ; and the village folks like him. He
is a great addition to the choir; and I shall certainly ask
him, in case he remains, to join our Mirk volunteers:
Steve tells me he is a most admirable shot with ariﬁe,
and will do the corps credit.”
“That is all the worse,” quoth Sir Richard, violently ;
“ he is only the more likely to be a poacher. We have
more than enough of that sort already, and I beg that you
will give none such your encouragement."
“Encouragement!” returned Walter, airily. “What
patronage'have I to offer? I am not Sir Richard, who
can make a man happy with a word.”
“Very well," continued the baronet with suppressed
passion, “let him take care how he trespasses upon the
Abbey-lands—that’s all.”
“ Nay, you’ll see him at the Abbey itself,” laughed
Walter, carelessly, “and that pretty often, unless I quite
misinterpreted Mistress Forest’s manner when she parted
from him at the Lyeh Gate: I never saw two people
more aﬁ'ectionate upon so short an acquaintance.”
“A most ineligible suitor, I am sure," broke forth the
baronet. “ I trust Mary is not fool enough to disgrace
herself at her time of life by any such alliance."
“ She is almost old enough to choose for herself,"
responded Walter, drily. “The selection of a husband
for one’s servant is scarcely the privilege of even a lord
of the manor, and when the servantis not one’s own "

“ I believe, Sir," interrupted Sir Richard, hastily,
“ that I am only speaking the sentiments of her mistress,
in whose hands, of course, the matter lies. Mother, do
you not agree with me that it would be very unwise to en-
courage any attachment between Mary Forest and this
reprobate stranger, Derrick ? ”
It was plain my lady had not recovered from her late
ailment, of whatever nature the attack might have been ; '
otherwise, she would have interfered between the brothers
before a direct appeal for her decision had been made by
either of them, it being a rule with her never to place
herself in an invidious position with respect to her
children. To the astonishment of the baronet himself,
1 however, Lady Lisgard now forced her pale lips to. utter
deliberately enough : “ I think it would be very unwise."
“And therefore,” pursued Sir Richard, hastening to
push his advantage, “it would be worse than unwise, it
would be absolute cruelty, since you do not intend her to
marry this fellow, that opportunities should be afforded
her of meeting him under the same roof. I do not say
that his offence of brawling in church this morning is a
sufﬁcient ground of itself for forbidding him the house,
although to most persons with any sense of decency it
would be a serious misdemeanour: but would it not be
well, under these particular circumstances, to treat it so P”
“ Y es,” returned my lady, rising from the table, white
as 3- ghOStr “ you are right, Richard; let this Mr. Derrick
be forbidden the house."

CHAPTER V.
MASTER \VALTERO
HE day after Christmas Day was friendly to the
fox ; in other words, a hard frost; and since
Miss Rose Aynton and Letty had declined to
play at billiards with Walter until the afternoon
-—-for it is vicious (in the country) to indulge in that
pastime in the morning, as it is to play at cards before
candlelight—that young gentleman, being no reader, felt
the time rather heavy on his hands, and strolled into the
village to get rid of it. The snow had ceased to fall, but
not before, like a good housekeeper when the family has
left town, it had covered up everything very carefully,
except the tops of the chimneys, through which the tidings
of good-cheer rolled forth in dusky columns from every
cottage ; for there were no abject poor in Mirk, thanks to
my lady, or any that lacked victuals at that joyous season.
The Lisgards had ever been a free-handed race, as
generous out of doors as hospitable within 5 and their in-
ﬂuence for good had been felt for generations throughout
the village. I do not say that they expected no repayment ;
their rule was paternal, and they looked for something
like ﬁlial obedience in return. If a villager had passed
any member of that august family without pulling his hair,
as though it were a bell-handle, in token of respect, it
would have been considered a sign of revolution, and they

would have congratulated themselves that the yeomanry
were in a state of eﬂiciency. The feudal system was still
in vogue at Mirk, but tempered not only by excellent
beef-tea in sickness, and port wine from the Abbey cellar
during convalescence, but by the best Gothic architecture,
as applied to cottages. If eleven human beings did
sometimes sleep in a single room, and the domestic ar-
rangements were inferior to those which Mr. Chifney of
the Farm provided for his race-horses, the tenement
looked outside very picturesque, as seen from the Abbey
windows. Nay, it must be owned that even this incon-
venience of overcrowding was rare in the home-village,
in comparison with other places on the Lisgard estate,
not so near the family seat, about which everything was in
extemals, at least, becomingly spick and span.
Dr. Haldane, indeed, who had property of his own,
and could aﬂord to entertain political opinions at variance
with those in favour at the Abbey, had been of old ac-
customed irreverently to adapt a certain popular nursery
ballad to the state of things at Mirk.
Who built the infant school so red?
Who set that striking-clock o’erhead,
To tell us all the time for bed ?
The Lisgards.
Who made, and at such great expense,
Around our pond that iron fence,
To keep the pigs and boys from thence ?
The Lisgatds, kc.
In short, Mirk was a pet hamlet, and exhibited a hun—
dred tokens of its patron’s favour. It was surely only
right and proper, therefore, that all the votes in the village
at election time, except the doctor’s, went the same way
with the squire’s, and that even in social matters be ex-
ercised unquestioned sway. Mirk was as respectable as
the brotherhood of Quakers, and was rendered so by the
same simple machinery ; anyone in the place who showed
a disposition to be otherwise was immediately turned out.

Did a man drink, so as to cause public disturbance, or
pick up sticks (to save himself trouble) out of the park—
fences—or, worse than all, did he peach—were it but a
pheasant’s egg—he received the most peremptory notice
to quit the model village. The issuing of these ukases
of banishment had been, new and then, a severe trial to
the popularity of the Lisgards ; but it had overlived all
such acts—nay, more, even its favouritism, that seemingly
indispensable element of the feudal system, had been
forgiven it. Nobody now complained that George Steve,
who notoriously never went to bed quite sober, still con-
tinued tenant of the Lisgard Arm: ,- while Jacob Flail and
Joseph Dibble had been condemned, with their families,
to banishment for life for a less habitual commission of
the same otTence.
Much less did it' strike the villagers that it was incon-
sistent in a landlord, so careful for the morality of his
people, to let so large a portion of the Abbey Farm to a
trainer of race-horses, of which there were at present
upwards of thirty in Mirk, and in summer, when the
Downland above was'ﬁt for their exercise, there were
often twice as many. But then Mr. Chifney was not like
an ordinary trainer; nor did his jockey-boys, thanks to
his strict supervision, behave like ordinary jockey-boys.
They attended divine service on alternate Sundays, and
half-a-dozen of them were in the choir. Mr. Moser
(who was Anglican) had even taken into consideration the
advisability of putting these last into surplices,'but Mr.
Chifney had dissuaded him from that experiment. They
had always been accustomed to the most tight-ﬁtting of
garments, strait-waistcoats, buck-skin breeches, and gaiters
-—-and perhaps he thought the transition would be too
abrupt. Their habits, in some other respects, were loose,
and yet they were suﬁered to breathe the Lisgard air.
Mr. Chifney’s boys were like the servants of ambassadors
at foreign courts, who enjoy a separate jurisdiction from
that to which the native inhabitants submit. T 116 law
itself—at least in the case of petty offences—was not

called in to punish these young gentlemen ; but I believe
theywere “colted"—for the whole discipline was “ horsey"
—-by Mr. Chifney's head~groom. I do not know the
exact manner in which this chastisement was inflicted,
but it must have differed from the ordinary method, since
they never failed to pursue their daily equestrian duties
as usual. Mr. Chifney looked after that himself, and
exceedingly sharp. Nothing went amiss through oversight
in his establishment, and his employers had every reason
to put conﬁdence in him. He left no means untried to
insure the success of the costly animals it was his mission
'to groom and guard. His very acceptance of the post of
churchwarden had been described by his enemies as an
attempt to “ hedge"—to make friends with those powers
of good which are generally supposed to be antagonistic,
if they have anything to do with~it at all, to the profession
of horse-racing. It is certain that Mr. Chifney, whose
occupations seldom permitted his own attendance at
public worship, never failed to come to church upon
those Sundays which immediately preceded the Derby
and the St. Leger, and indeed it is very likely that he
treated them (without knowing it) as the eves of his
patron saints' days.
It was to the Abbey Farm that Mr. Walter Lisgard was
now bound; for to the young gentlemen of England,
what is a more interesting spectacle than a racing-stable
—what is a more charming subject of conversation than
the next Great Event? And who more ﬁtted to afford
every information upon that important topic—if he chose
—than Mr. Tite Chifney? (/11: More. Therein lay the
whole matter; for Mr. Chifney was reticent, as became
one intrusted with a hundred thousand pounds' worth
of horseflesh, upon whose performances depended per-
haps, in the aggregate, millions of money. He had put
“Master Walter ” up to a “ good thing," however, more
than once, and the captain had no doubt but that he
would do it again. He never did dorfot of his own
success either with man or woman. Confidence, but

without swagger, self-content, but without vanity, were
evident enough in those handsome features, illuminated
almost at all times with the desire to please. He lit his
cigar at the hall door, smoothed away a fallen spark from
his sealskin waistcoat, and took his way down the leaf-
less avenue, humming the latest lively air, as he crunched
the snow beneath his dainty boots. How different from
Sir Richard’s measured step and haughty silence, thought
the gatekeeper’s wife, as she hastened out of the lodge,
from the side-window of which she had marked her
favourite approach. “Never mind me, Martha,” cried
he laughing; “ I’m tall enough now to lift the latch for
myself. My boots are thicker than yours are—look—
and I have no rheumatism, which, I am afraid, you have
not quite got rid of yet. There—I won't speak a word
with you till you go inside. How‘s the guidman P Ah,
out, is he? How's little Polly? Hullo, Polly, how
you're grown ! Why, I dare say she won’t kiss me now,
as she always used to do.”
“Oh yes, she’ll kiss you, Master Walter,” answered
the old dame; “there’s no harm in kissing 0' you;
although I wouldn’t say that to my daughter of ne’er
another young man in the county—Come, lass, you need
not blush so, for I’ve had manya one from the same
young gentleman." And the old dame laughed and
chuckled, until that dread enemy of honest-hearted mirth
the lumbago, twitched her into her Chair.
Polly, a very pretty country lassie, about sixteen, stood
pink and hesitating while the captain removed his
cigar, and waited—smiling demigod—for the promised
favour.
“ Come, gi’e it to him, and ha’ done wi’ it,” cried the
old lady, exasperated by her torments. Thereupon the
girl stepped forward, head aside. Master Walter met her,
touched her soft cheek with his lip, and as his silken
moustache brushed her ear, whispered an airy something
which turned her crimson. There was nothing in the
words themselves save the merest compliment; their

magic lay in the tone of him who used them ; so tender,
yet so frank, so familiar, and yet so gracious. Then,
with a smile, he bade them both “ good-bye," and strolling
through the gate, resumed his interrupted duty, as though
kissing were the most innocent as well as the most
natural of all pastimes ; but Polly pressed her throbbing
brow against the pane for its very coolness, and watched
him saunter down the village street with quite a flutter
at her heart, and promised to herself that she would not
forget the captain’s kiss—no, not though Joe, the under-
gardener, should speak his mind next “feast” (as it was
rumoured in well-informed circles that he intended to do),
and “keep her company” in earnest.
That she was doing no wrong in this was certain, for not
only her mother, but everybody else in Mirk, agreed that
there was no sort of harm in Master Walter, let him do
what he might. He had a way of doing things so very
different from others. How the very dogs fawned upon
him as he sauntered on, and the old horse in the straw-
yard stretched its gray head over the gate in hopes of
a caress as he went by! How the boys by the road-
side left their Snow-man an unfinished torso, and ran to
make their bows before the good-natured captain, with
an eye to largesse, in the form of a copper scramble : and
how the school-girls courtesied, with admiring awe, as they
pictured to themselves how ﬁne a figure handsome
Master Walter must needs cut in gold and scarlet ! He
had a nod or a word for almost everybody, young or
old ; but if his look but lit upon another‘s face, it left a
pleasure there, as the sun leaves when it has shone upon
one. Delayed by these reciprocal manifestations of
good-will, like a young prince making a Royal Progress
among a well-affected people, Walter Lisgard at length
got free of the village, and climbing a steep hill (never
used by the race-horses even in much less slippery
weather), arrived at his destination, the Abbey Farm.
This was a long, low, ancient building, belonging to one

and added to, had been the original structure; but
when the Abbey was an Abbey the Abbey Farm had
been a sort of branch-establishment, in the occupation
of the monks; there were traces of their sojourn even
now: over the pointed porch yet stood a cross of
stone, though broken; and in the garden, now all
white and hoar, that lay between the house and road,
there was a mighty sun-dial, carved likea font, with nose-
less saints in niches, and round the rim a scripture, of
which alone the words was unit could be deciphered.
The night had come, not only upon those who built
and blessed such things, but on the faith which they
professed. The very memory of themselves and it had
faded from men’s minds. Not one in ten at Mirk—
where all had owned the Abbot for liege lord, and
bowed their heads before his meanest monk, in token
of their souls' humility, but a few centuries back—not
one in ten, I say, could tell even what that niche on
the south side of the communion-table meant, which the
learned called Prim‘na. The mighty bower that had once
been the granary of the Abbey, and to which the poor
had looked with thankful eyes in times of scarcity, still
stood beside the homestead, but the remembrance of its
very use was gone; the only legend clinging to its
moss-grown walls was that a Long Parliament had once
held its sittings there. Save the farmhouse and the barn,
all relics of the past had been swept away. Imme-
diately behind them was quite a town of stables and
loose boxes, all of the most modern construction, and
furnished with the latest inventions for equine comfort.
The enormous farmyard, strewn with a thick carpet of
clean straw, was now the exercising-ground for the horses ;
but in the summer, a gate at the back of the premises
opened immediately upon the grassy upland, the prox-
imity of which had tempted Mr. Tite Chifney to pitch his
tent and enlarge his boundaries at the Abbey Farm. So
high had been the rent he offered for this eligible situation,
that the late Sir Robert had removed his own agricultural

head-quarters elsewhere, and suffered Mr. Chifney and
his race-horses to occupy the whole place, which was now
the capital of the Houwhyhims—the largest establishment
in Great Britain, wherein man held the secondary position,
and the horse the principal.

CHAPTER VI.
THE RACING-STABLE-
T Was Mr. Chifney in person who admitted Wal-
ter Lisgard, after a precautionary glance at him
through a little grating, which doubtless the
monks had used fora similar purpose, although
without the same excuse, for they had never possessed
any Derby “ cracks " to be poisoned. Mr. Chifney might
have been himself a monk but for his apparel, which,
although scrupulously neat and plain, ﬁtted him almost
like war-paint, so that there was not a crease to be seen,
except at the knees, of which he made as much use as the
holy fathers themselves did, though not precisely in the
same way. His dark hair was closely cropped, and a
little bald spot on the top of the crown might well have
been taken for a tonsure. Moreover, he had a grave and
secretive look, which would have well enough become
one in whom were reposed the secrets of the Confes-
sional ; and when he smiled, he looked sorry for it im-
mediately afterwards, as though he had given way to a
carnal pleasure.
Captain Lisgard shook the trainer's hand with his
usual hearty warmth, and Mr. Chifney returned his pres
sure with unwonted cordiality. He was accustomed to
meet men of a much higher social rank than his present
visitor on something like equal terms; many of them

shook hands with him; all of them treated him with
familiarity. The turf, like the grave, levels all distinc-
tions. Between the lord and the blackleg (to make an
antithetical use of terms that are not seldom synonymous),
there is but slight partition on that common ground; the
widest gulf of social difference is bridged over, pm 1:01.,
by the prospect of an advantageous bet. How much
more, then, was this wont to be the case in view of the
trustworthy “information” which Mr. T ite Chifney had
it so often in his power to bestow? Marquises had taken
his arm in a conﬁdential manner before now in the most
public places, and dukes had called him “Tite ;” even
ladies of the highest fashion had treated him to pretty
speeches, and to what they hoped might turn out literally
“winning ways." But the great trainer estimated all
these condesceusions at their true value. He never con-
cealed from himself the motives that caused these people
to be so civil to him; and perhaps he had seen too much
of the turﬁte aristocracy to be ﬂattered by their atten-
tions, even had they been disinterested. But Walter
Lisgard’s greeting was different from those which he was
wont to receive from his great patrons ,' there was not
only a cordial frankness about it, but a something of
sympathy, conveyed with marvellous tact, in his air and
manner ; which seemed to say: “I unfeignedly regret that
anything like friendship should be impossible between us,
for I am your social superior; and yet, how ridiculous a
thing it is that this should be so. I, but the younger brother
of a man himself of no great position, and you, at the head
of that profession in which the noblest in the land take
so great and personal an interest.” If Mr. Chifney did
not read all this, it is certain that so acute an observer
could not fail to read some of it. He was as far from
being moved by any considerations not strictly practical
as any man connected with horseﬁesh; his calling, too,
rendered him as suspicious of his fellow-creatures as a
police detective ,' but Master Walter’s sort of ﬂattery was
too subtle for him. He had always had a liking for this

genial young fellow, with his handsome face and pleasant
speech, and who, moreover, rode across country like a
centaur ; he was one of his own landlord’s family, too, and
the heir-presumptive of the property, whose favour it was
just as well to win and keep; and lastly, the lad had been
so unfeignedly grateful to him for the little hints he had
occasionally afforded him, as well as so wisely reticent
about his informant, that he was not unwilling to help
him again to a few “ ﬁvers,” if he could do so without the
betrayal of professional confidence.
“Come for another ‘tip,’ eh, Master Walter?" whis-
pered he good-naturedly as he led the way into the house.
“You see I did not deceive you the last time you were ‘
here about Cambyserf"
“ No, indeed, you did not, Mr. Chifney ” (Walter
never addressed this friend of his without the Alister),
“ and a very great blessing it was to yours thankfully at
a time when he was even more hard-up than usual. Is
your Derby ‘ crack ’ visible to-day P I am poor, but
honest. I have no motive beyond that of curiosity, and
if suspected of a concealed weapon, will submit to be
searched."
“Well, Master Walter,” grinned the trainer, “I can’t
say that I much credit the honesty of anybody myself;
but I don’t see why you should not have a look at his
majesty, particularly as there is one coming here this
morning already upon the same errand, and I'm sure I’d as
soon oblige you as him—or, indeed, as any man, let it be
who it will.”
“ You are very kind to say so, Mr. Chifney, and still
more to mean it, as I am sure you do ; but I feel that I
have no right with my bagatelle of a stake depending
upon the matter to take up your time—nay, I must insist
upon throwing my cigar away before entering your
house ; it is all very well for Mrs. Chifney to give you the
privilege of smoking within doors, but I could not venture
to take such a liberty myself. What a jolly place this is
of yours ! I always think it is so much snugger than the

Abbey. I should never sit anywhere but in your grand
old kitchen if I were you.”
“Well, the fact is we do sit a good deal in the kitchen,"
returned Mr. Chifney reddening. “ It’s warm, you see,
although its large, and my wife likes to see how things are
going on. She's engaged there just at present, and-—
you're a great favourite of hers ; but I would recommend
you to step in as you go 01d, instead of now. A queer
thing is woman, Master Walter, and no man can tell how
queer till he comes to be married! Young gals is all
sweetness and easily cajoled ; but wives—oh lorl Now,

that give us trouble, and have such tempers of their own.
There ; that’s a Derby nag, Blue Ruin, in the clothes
yonder, and I believe the duke would not sell him for
three thousand pounds; but I have told His Grace, as I
tell you, that I wouldn’t back the horse even for a
place.”
“A splendid stepper, too,” exclaimed Walter ad-
miringly, as the beautiful creature paced slowly round
the straw-yard, with arching neck and distended nostrils,
as though he were aware of the trainer's depreciating
remarks, and could afford to despise them.
“That’s true,” rejoined Mr. Chifney drily; “but we
don’t want steppers, but goers ; there's a vast 0f steppers
in this world, both men and horses. Now in that box
yonder, there is an animal who, in my opinion, could
give Blue Ruin ten pounds; but you shall judge for
yourself presently. T/w King’s palace is this next one.”
And truly, scarce could horse be better housed than
was his equine majesty. No light-house could be more
exquisitely clean ; no drawing-room in Mayfair more neat,
or better suited to the requirements of its inhabitant, al-
though of ornament, save the plaited straw that fringed
the royal couch, there was nothing. A dim religious
light pervaded this sanctuary, which was kept at a
moderate temperature by artiﬁcial means, while an ad-

mirable ventilation prevented the slightest “smell of the
stable” from being perceptible. The object of all this
consideration was a magniﬁcent bay horse, by rule of
Liliput, very ﬁtly named T/w King, since, if not a head
taller than his fellows, he was fully “ a hand." His coat
quite shone amid the gloom, and as the key turned
in the door, he pricked his long ﬁne ears, and turned his
full eyes upon his two visitors inquiringly, with far more
expression in his lean-jawed face than is possessed by
many a human creature.
“This gives the world assurance of a horse indeed,”
muttered Walter to himself as he contemplated this
- wonder. “Show me his faults, Mr. Chifney, for his
excellences dazzle me.”
“ Well, Sir," whispered the trainer, looking up towards
a square hole in the ceiling, “it is not for me to de-
preciate ‘the crack ;' and there’s a boy up yonder—for
the horse is never left for a moment, night or day—who
is getting too sharp to live, at least in my stables. But
look at what he stands on.”
Most men who ride think it a disgrace not to know all
about a horse. Every man who keeps a pony thinks
himself qualiﬁed to “pick” out the winner from any
number of thoroughbreds before “the start ;” and when the
race is over, protests that he llad picked him out in his
own mind, only something (not quite satisfactorily ex-
plained) made him distrust his own judgment, and back
a loser.
It was a' great temptation to Captain Walter Lisgard,
of the 104th Light Dragoons, to show himself horse-wise,
but he put it from him manfully, or rather with strength
of mind far beyond that of most men of his class. “The
pasterns seem to be long and_str0ng enough," answered
he, “and the feet neither too large nor too small.” .
“Just what my lord says,” observed the trainer in the
same low tones; “ nor can I make him see that there 18
any degree of contraction. But he is not your horse, so
tell me; look now—is it not so?”

It was so, or at least it seemed to be so to the captain,
as the trainer returned the faulty member to its proprietor,
with the air of a banker declining a forged cheque.
“ It is of small consequence to me,” said Walter ; “but
I shall be sorry if the winner does not come out of your
stable. I took a thousand to twenty in October, which
I can now hedge to great advantage.”
_ “If you take my advice, you will hold on," said Mr.
Chifney conﬁdentially. “Twenty pounds is little to lose,
and what I have shown you by no means destroys his
chance ; moreover, The King will not be deposed in the
betting. I shall be surprised if, in the paddock, they lay
more than three to one." -
“You were going to tell me something, Mr. Chifney,
only you thought better of it," said Captain Lisgard,
laying his ﬁnger upon the other's coat-cuff, as they
emerged from the royal presence. “ And yet you trusted
me when I was but a boy at school, and I never abused
your conﬁdence.”
“ What a fellow you are to read a chap 1 " returned the
trainer admiringly. “Burst {ny buttons, but you are a
cunning one, Master Walter. It was true that I was
thinking of letting you into a little secret—though after
all, it mayn’t be worth much. Let us come on to the
ten-gallop for ﬁve minutes, for nowhere else can we get
out of earshot of these boys." With that, passing through
a paddock, itself provided with a straw-ride, so that the
race-horses need not set foot upon the frost-bound turf as
they issued forth to exercise, Mr. Chifney led the way to
the upland, where a broad brown road of tan was per-
manently laid on the level down. Here the trainer
paused, and speaking aloud for the ﬁrst time, observed in
a solemn tone: “ Now, look you, true as fate, I would
tell no other man but you. What I said about T114 King’s
feet was on the square : but that aint all. There’s a
horse here as nobody ever heard of, and yet who's a real

“ Morning, Mr. Chifney,” said the new-comer, nodding
familiarly to the trainer. “And morning to you, Sir, if
you aint too proud to accept it.” .
He was a large-built middle-aged man, with a sunburnt
countenance, generally good-humoured enough, not-
withstanding the presence of a truculent red heard, but
upon this occasion somewhat sullen, and even deﬁant.
. Walter recognised in him the stranger stopping at the
Lisgard Arms, at once, and was at no loss to account
for his displeasure. He had doubtless received some
hint that his presence at the Abbey. would not be
welcome.
“Good-morning, Mr. Derrick,” returned the captain
cheerfully. “There’s no pride about me, since, un-
fortunately, I have nothing to be proud of ,- but if there
was, why should I not return a civil reply to a civil
speech P ”
“Oh, because I aint good enough to speak to,"
answered the other scomfully. “ Because I aint a
gentleman, forsooth, like your high and mighty family.
But the fact is, Sir, although I have got decent blood in
my veins myself, I come from a country where we don’t
care t/zat”—-and be snapped his ﬁngers with a noise
equal to the crack of a whip—“for who is a man’s father,
unless the man himself is worth his salt.”
“That, then, must have been the reason why this
good-for-nothing ruflian left that country,” thought the
captain ; but he answered with humility: “Then, I fear,
I should be giving up my best chance if I went there.”
“Well,” answered the stranger, somewhat molliﬁed.
“ you don’t speak like one of them beastly aristocrats—
that I will say—as though it were too much trouble to
open their darned lips.”

Mr. Derrick himself did not speak like an aristocrat
either; his voice, though rich in song, had in speech a
strong northern burr, which rescued it from any such
imputations. “ Why, if a man in my country,” continued
he, “ should venture to warn another off his land—unless,
of course, it was a mining claim—as Sir Richard Lis-
gard__"
“Mr. Derrick,” interrupted the captain ﬁrmly, “I am
sure that it is not the custom in any country in the world
to abuse a man’s brother to his face. Having said that
much, I will add that, if you have received any rudeness
from anyone at the Abbey, I am sincerely sorry for it.
It did not emanate from me. Mr. Chifney here will give
me a character so far."
“Master Walter is as civil-spoken and well-behaved a
young gentleman as any in the county," exclaimed the
trainer warmly; “and I will go bail has never given you
or any man offence. He has just stepped in, like you,
to see ‘the crack,’ on which he has a little money,- and
since I am not one of those who say: ‘It is no use now-
adays to attempt to take in your enemies, and therefore
your friends must stiﬁer,’ I have been giving him some
advice."
“About Manylawr?" inquired the stranger suspici-
ously, turning sharp round upon the captain.
The look of blank astonishment upon that gallant
ofﬁcer‘s face would have set at rest the doubts of a
Pollaky.
“It is not my habit to disclose my customers’ secrets,”
observed the trainer tartly; “although I may say that,
with Master Walter, everything is as safe as wax."
“Is it so? ” quoth Mr. Derrick warmly. “Then let him
come with us and see the Black—Only mind, Mr.
Walter Lisgard, I will not have that brother of yours
bettered by a fourpenny-piece by anything you may see
or hear to-day."
“ My brother never bets upon any race,” answered the
captain quietly; “ so that promise is easily given."

“Then come along with me and Mr. Chifney,” said
me stranger, holding out his hairy hand in token of amity.
‘You've read a deal about that crack as I’ve just been
looking at ; but I dare say, now, you have never so much
'as heard of this same Mallylawr."
“ Not unless you mean the French horse, about which
there were a few lines in Bell some time ago—Aleueltzur."
“ Ay, that's him. But it's called Marg'lawr," explained
Mr. Derrick ; “for you wouldn’t think of calling the
Oaks’ mare Anlzlgown, I suppose, Antigone. Well, the
Black aint fancied much, I reckon ; but he will be, Mr.
Chifney, eh? He will be? ”
“It is my opinion that he will be at very short odds
indeed,” returned the trainer; “and many more people
will be desirous of paying him a call than do him that
honour just at present. This is his stable. He does not
look quite such a likely horse as T/ze King, Master Walter,
does he? There’s bone for you !”
“An ounce of blood is worth a pound of bone, says the
proverb,” remarked the captain.
“ So far as that gees, although he is a Frenchman,"
answered the trainer, “he has Godolphin’s blood in his
veins. But only look at his ragged hips l”
“Ragged enough, Mr. Chifney. And do you mean to
say that this animal will be a public favourite P"
“ We hope not," returned the trainer, winking face-
tiously at his bearded friend 3 “ but Shall we tell
him what we do hope, Mr. Derrick P ”
“I’ll tell him myself,” quoth the other impulsively, “ for
you say the young gentleman is safe, and I have taken a
sort of unaccount ".ble fancy to him. We hope, and more
than that, believe, Captain Lisgard, that that same ragged-
hipped horse will win the Derby l ”
“Two hundred to one against Mr. Blanquette’s Mme-
laus," murmured Walter pathetically, as though it were a
line from some poem of the affections.

with a chuckle, and rattling a quantity of loose silver and

to lay it in ponies with Mr. Chifney and me.”
“ N 0, Mr. Derrick ; but I should like to thank you
very much for letting me into this secret, which, I assure
you, shall never pass my lips 3” and he held out his hand
to the stranger.
“Our way lies together as far as the inn,” returned the
other warmly ; “ we’ll liquor But there; I forgot I
was no longer in Cariboo. I dare say a gentleman like
you don’l liquor so early in the day."
“At all events, I will walk with you, my good Sir,”
answered the captain laughing; and so, forgetting to
repeat his request to be permitted to pay his respects to
the trainer’s wife, he took his departure with his new ac-
quaintance.
“ And who 2': this Monsieur Blanquette? " inquired
Walter carelessly as they walked down the village street.
“ He was a mate of mine at the gold-diggings in British
Columbia, and the only Frenchman as ever I saw there.
We did a pretty good stroke of work together ,' and when
we came home, he invested his money in horseﬂesh, and
that there Mmylawr was one of his cheapest bargains."
“ I think I saw it stated somewhere that Mr. Blanq-
uette is only part-owner of the horse P ” observed the
captain inquiringly.
“That’s s0,” rejoined the other. “It belongs to him
and a company."
“ And you are the company, eh, Mr. Derrick P "
“ You have hit it," responded the bearded man with the
air of a proprietor. “This here child is the C0. in ques-
tum.”

CHAPTER VII.
A BROKEN FRIENDSHIP.
EEKS and months have passed by at Mirk
Abbey; the snow has thawed, and the cold
winds of March have done their worst, and the
spring is clothing nature’s nakedness with gar-
ments of green. Yet all this time, my lady, who is so
fond of outdoor exercise, even in rough weather, and
such a constant visitor of the poor, has never been seen
beyond the park gates. To be sure, she has had more to
keep her within than usual, for the captain not only got
his leave prolonged at the beginning of the year, but
came home for three weeks very shortly after, and is
at Mirk again at the present time. Miss Rose Aynton,
too, a very nice young lady, and most attentive to her
hostess, seems to have become quite a resident at the
Abbey, for, with the exception of a week’s absence in
London, she has remained there since Christmas, her
departure having indeed been vaguely ﬁxed more than
once, but only to be as indeﬁnitely postponed. It is
now understood that she will certainly stay over the
festivities attendant upon Sir Richard's coming of age
in June. The baronet himself, who, his detractors say,
always prefers the country, where he is somebody, to
town, where baronets are plentiful; has scarcely been
away at all. He writes to inquiring friends in London,

most of whom happen to have marriageable daughters,
that he is immersed in business connected with the
estate, and cannot leave Mirk at present. Mr. Rinkel, the
agent, however, has seen no cause to relax his ordinal-y
exertions, in consequence of this new-born application of
the young gentleman to his own affairs; and Walter
wickedly asserts that his brother is in reality Occupied
with no other business whatever save that of keeping the
man Derrick from trespassing upon the Abbey lands.
He is very glad, he says, that Richard has at last found
an object in life, and hopes that, like the French sports-
man’s woodcock, it will last him for a good long time.
It does not help to heal the breach between the bro-
thers that Walter and this same man have grown very
intimate, a fact which Sir Richard (assuming to himself a
metaphor usually applied only to Providence) stigmatises 35
“ﬂying in his face."—His mother, however, declines to
take this view of it—declines even to express an opinion
about it one way or another, and avoids the subject as much
as she can. Even with the conﬁdential maid, notwith-
standing her decision about Mr. Derrick's ineligibility as
a suitor, she forbears to reason with respect to this matter,
although it is understood that the forbidden swain is
gaining ground in the affections of Mistress Forest.
There is but one person to whom my lady has opened
her lips concerning the man she dimly saw by lantern-
light on Christmas Eve, and has never seen since. Her
conﬁdant—if one can be called so to whom so little was
conﬁded—is Mr. Arthur Haldane, the only son of the
doctor, and one who has been a great favourite with Lady
Lisgard from his youth up, not for his own sake merely,
although he is honest and kind, and very winning with
those who look beyond externals (for he is not good-
looking, or, at least, does not appear so by contrast with
her own handsome sons), but for another reason; my
lady owed him a reparation of love for a wrong that she
had inadvertently done his father.
Dr. Haldane and the late Sir Robert had been at


## p. 55 (#61) ##############################################

A Broken Fnlemls/uf. 55
school together, and their boy-friendship had lasted, as it
seldom does, through their university course. Their
mutual esteem had not afterwards suffered by propinquity,
when they came to pass their days within a few hundred
yards of one another; and when my lady married, she
found that the dearest friend her husband had on earth
was Dr. Haldane. She was not the woman to come
between her husband’s friends and himself: and the
doctor (who had had his doubts about the matter before
he came to know her) was wont to declare the Abbey
was even more of a second home to him than it used to
be, now that his old friend had placed so charming a mis-
tress at the head of it. He was always welcome there, and
being himself a widower, was glad to take advantage of
Sir Robert’s hospitality whenever he could ; a knife and
fork were laid for him at table all the year round; and
when he did not appear at the dinner-hour, either husband
or wife was sure to observe: “ Iain afraid we shall not
see the doctor with us to-day." It would have seemed as
though nothing short of death could have interrupted
such cordiality as this.
But in those days there was such a thing aspolitics.
The baronet was a Tory, and his friend a Whig of what
was afterwards called “advanced opinions.” Theybickered
over their wine three nights out of every seven, though
they never failed to drink each other’s healths before they
sought the company of the hostess. These political
discussions (unfortunately, as it turned out) were scrupu-
lously conﬁned to the dining-room, so that my lady had
no idea of the strength of the respective prejudices of the
combatants, and of the severity of the trial to which
their friendship was so often subjected. Brought up as
she had been among persons in humble life, who were
engaged in bread-winning (a very monopolising occupa-
tion), and educated in France, where the question of
English reform was never mooted, she knew little or
nothing of the matters which formed the subjects of dis-
pute, although they were setting half England together by

the ears. It seems strange to read of now, but the idol
which Toryism had set up to worship at that epoch was a
heartless and vulgar fop, whom it sycophantically dubbed
the First Gentleman'in Europe; while the Whigs pinned _
their faith upon the virtue of his wife, a woman as vulgar
as himself, and whom her enemies endeavoured to show
was almost as vicious. Over this good-for-nothing pair,
Lords, Commons, and People were quarrelling together,
like a mob at a dog-ﬁght, and the public press was solely
occupied with hounding them on. To dip into a news-
paper of that date is to make an excursion to Billingsgate,
for both parties, equally unable to whitewash their candi-
date, conﬁned themselves to vilifying their Opponent.
When the report upon the bill of Pains and Penalties
against Queen Caroline was ﬁnally approved by a ma-
jority of nine only, and those nine representing the votes
of the ministers themselves, the popular excitement cul-
minated. The Whigs decreed that there should be illu-
minations throughout the kingdom, and (what seems
hard) that their adversaries should express the same
satisfaction in a similar manner. For three consecutive
nights, the Londoners made plain the innocence of their
queen, so far as pyrotechnics and oil-lamps could do it;
and for one night, the country was expected to do the
like. Vast mobs paraded the streets of the provincial
towns, to see that this was done, and even made excur-
sions to the country-houses of the disaffected. Among
others, Mirk Abbey was threatened with a visitation of
this sort ; and I must confess that the doctor rather
chuckled over the notion, that the stubborn Sir Robert,
who had called his sovereign lady so many opprobrious
epithets, would have to dedicate his candles to her, as
though she were his patron saint. The baronet, on his
part, protested that every window in his house should be
broken rather than exhibit so much as a farthing-dip ; but
he said nothing to his wife about the matter, lest it should
make her nervous.
They happened to be engaged to pass that November

week at a friend’s house in the country, and left home
accordingly. The gentleman with whom they stayed
himself suffered some inconvenience from the rioters on
the night in question ; and when Sir Robert came back,
he was even less inclined to be a convert to his Whig
friend’s opinions than before.
“ But you did illuminate,” said the doctor with a
chuckle, as they sat together after dinner, as usual, upon
the day of his return.
“ I did nothing of the kind, Sir,” returned the baronet
angrily.
“Well, your servants did it for you, then, and I pre-
sume by your orders. Mr. Brougham himself could not
have exhibited his patriotism more signiﬁcantly. The
Abbey was a blaze of light from basement to garret.”
“That is a lie !” cried Sir Robert, making the glasses
jump with the force with which he brought his ﬁst down
upon the table.
“A what? ” exclaimed the doctor, rising from the table
livid with rage. “ Do you, then, call me a liar?"
“Yes,” thundered the baronet ; “like all your Radical
crew.”
The two men that had so long been nearer and dearer
to each other than brothers never again interchanged one
word.
Dr. Haldane left the Abbey, solemnly protesting that
he would never cross its threshold again during the life-
time of its owner ; and he kept his determination even in
the hour when his old friend lay a-dying.
Now, poor Lady Lisgard was the person to blame for
all this. Before Sir Robert and she had set out on their
visit, the housekeeper had told her that everybody was
going to illuminate their houses on the 12th, on account
of what had happened in London with respect to Queen
Caroline; and she was afraid that if some sign of rejoic—
ing was not shown at the Abbey, the mob would do some
damage. A candle in each of the windows would save a
hundred pounds of mischief belike. “Well, then, put a

candle." said my lady, not dreaming that by that simple
order she was wounding her husband in his most vital
point, his pride, and making a sacriﬁce of principles that
he held only second to those of the Christian religion.
She did not even think it necessary to tell him that she
had left this command behind her ; but when she heard
him praise the determination of the friend with whom
they stayed, not to submit to the dictation of the rabble,
she had not the heart to tell him of the mistake she had
committed, and which it was by that time too late to
remedy. That mistake, and, still more, her unfortunate
reiicence, had caused the quarrel, destined never to be
healed, betwixt her husband and his friend. They both
forgave her, but she could not forgive herself. It seemed
to her that she could never do enough to show how sorry
she was for her grievous fault. We have said how she
made up so far as was in her power, in love and duty to
Sir Robert, for the loss of his friend; but to that friend
himself, self-exiled from her roof, and out of the reach, as
it were, of reparation, how was she to atone for the wrong
she had inadvertently done him P When the quarrel ﬁrst
took place, the doctor’s wrath was quite unquenchable ;
he would listen to nothing except an apology—a debt
which Sir Robert (although he certainly owed it) most
resolutely refused to pay. The doctor, who had hitherto
conﬁned his Whiggism to after-dinner eloquence, and
coarse but biting epigrams, which had earned him the
reputation of a philosopher with those of his own party,
thereupon became an active political partisan, and not
only voted at election-time, but canvassed with might and
main against the Lisgard interest; nay, he even com-
posed, as we have ventured to hint, satirical ballads
against the paternal rule of that respectable family.
But although neither sex nor age was spared in those
savage days, not one word did the vengeful d0ct0r breathe
about my lady; nay, it was on record that when some

her humble extraction in the presence of that friend

estranged, he had risen to his full height of ﬁve feet
eight, and levelled the slanderer to the earth. Perhaps
my lady did not esteem him the less upon that account 3
but certain it was that the ﬁrst visit she paid after Sir
Robert’s death was to the doctor's house, taking with
her, it was said, from her husband's dying lips, a message
of affectionate reconciliation. The baronet had never
brought himself to alter the words in his will by which he
had appointed his tried and loving friend, Bartholomew
Haldane, trustee for his children ; and of course the
doctor accepted his trust. He never could be induced
to visit the Abbey, although his oath no longer forbade
it ; but the Lisgard children were his constant guests,
and his only son, Arthur Haldane, was as another brother
to them, and almost as another son to my lady. His
nature was grave and serious, like Sir Richard’s, but very
tender withal, and she felt that she could conﬁde in him
what she could not have conﬁded to the rigid young
baronet, although he was her own ﬂesh and blood ; never-
theless, or perhaps for that very reason, when she took
Arthur's arm that April morning, upon pretence of show-
ing him some alterations that were proposed to be made
at a place in the Abbey-grounds called the “ Watersmeet,”
she thought it necessary to preface what she was going to
say to him with an explanation.
“ My dear Arthur,” said she, when they had got out
of view of the house, “you will think it cruel that I have
brought you away from the society of that charming
young lady, Miss Aynton, to chat with an old woman like
me, who have boys of my own to take counsel with ; but the
fact is, I have inveigled you hither to get an opinion from
you which I could scarcely ask of your learned brother."
This was conferring a brevet rank upon Sir Richard,
who had not yet been called to the Bar, although he was
reading for it; while Arthur had been in practice for
some years.
“My dear Lady Lisgard,” returned the other smiling,
“ I must, for my professional credit’s sake, enter my pro-

test against what you say about Miss Aynton, as irre-
levant, and travelling out of the record, but besides that,
it is a delusion which I should be sorry to see you enter-
tain. Miss Aynton is nothing whatever to me; although,
indeed, if she were, I would rather chat with you than
with any young lady (save one) in Christendom."
The young barrister's tone was so unnecessarily earnest
and impressive, that one so acute as Lady Lisgard could
scarcely have failed to see that he courted inquiry con-
cerning such excess of zeal. She either saw it not, how-
ever, or refused to see it; and he was far too delicate by
nature to press it upon her attention. “And now, ma
mére," continued he, taking her hand in his affectionately,
“in what way can I be of use to you P”
“ By your good sense, and by your good feeling,
Arthur. I need the aid of your talents and your virtues,
too, dear boy ; I want your best advice, and then your
promise that you will never disclose that I have asked it."
“You shall have both those, ma mere. As the pashas
say to the sultan when there is nothing to fear: ‘ I bring
you my head ,-’ as for my heart—that has been devoted
to you these many years."

CHAPTER VIII.
AT THE WATERSMEET.


, w ADY LISGARD and her young friend had by
this time arrived at the Watersmeet,a lovely
spot, where the river branched into two streams,
' the one still pursuing its course through the
Lisgard property, and the other escaping under a sort of
swing palisade—which prevented the passage of boats—
into public life. The way had lain for some time along
a broad beech-walk, paved with an exquisite checker-
work of light and shade; but they now came upon an
open spot on which a rustic bench was placed for those
who would admire at leisure what was called the home-
view. The prospect from this seat was remarkable, since
it took in all that was best worth seeing at Mirk, without
laying under contribution anything, with the exception of
the church, that was not the property of the family. Two
sides of the Abbey, an irregular but very picturesque
structure, could from here be seen, at a distance not so
great as to lose the bolder features of the architecture, or
to mass the ivy which Time had hung about the southern
front; the sloping lawn, with its marble fountain, and
alcove of trellis-work, which the spring-time had but
sparely clothed with leaf; the boat-house, with its carved
and gilded roof—all these, backed by a living wall of
stately woods, made up a charming picture. The park
lay across the stream, which, although both broad and

deep, was only used by pleasure-boats; and above the
one-arched bridge which linked it with the hither bank
beyond the lawn, stood up the gray church tower. Gazing
upon this view, not as one who had seen it a thousand
times before, and might behold it as often again, but with
eyes that had a strange yearning and regret in them, Lady
Lisgard thus addressed her companion.
“ I want to speak to you about my Walter, Arthur. A
mother, alas! cannot know her son as his friend knows
him; and you, I believe, are Walter’s truest friend—"
“One moment, Lady Lisgard,” interrupted the young
man gravely ; “ everybody is Walter‘s friend, but some
are his ﬁatterers. I must tell you at once that he is dis-
pleased with me at present because I am not one of
those."
“Yes ; you have warned him of some danger, and he
is piqued because he thinks that is treating him as a
child.”
“Since you know that, ma mére, you know all that is
necessary to be said. Go on.” . '
“What is the bond, Arthur, that links my Walter to
this person Derrick? I pray you, do not hesitate to tell
me. There is more depends upon your answer than you
can possibly guess."
“Really, Lady Lisgard,” returned the young man hesi-
tatingly, “you ask a difﬁcult thing, and in truth, a deli-
cate. There are some things, as you say, which a son
does not tell his mother, and far less wishes to have told
to her by another. Women and men take such different
views of the same matter. If men are vicious—which I
do not deny—in their love of horse-racing, for instance,
women reprobate it in an exaggerated way."
“ Horse-racing l” murmured Lady Lisgard, clasping
her hands. “Does my Walter bet P Is he a gambler?"
“I did not say that,” answered the young man with
irritation. “ If you insist upon making me a tale-bearer,
Lady Lisgard, do not at least heighten the colour of my
scandals."

“I beg your pardon, Arthur; I was wrong. Perhaps
this eagerness to suspect the worst is the cause of that
distrust which the young entertain of the old. And yet
Ire might have told me all, and been sure of forgiveness."
“ Doubtless, ma mére; but then we don’t tell our
mothers all. Now, pray, be reasonable, and assure your-
self that Walter is no worse than other young men, be-
cause he makes up a book upon the Derby.”
“ You do not do so, Arthur. Why should Walter?”
“I do not, ma mére, because my taste does not lie in
that direction. My vices—and I have plenty—~are of
another sort. I unsettle my mind with heterodox pub-
lications. I entertain opinions which are subversive of
the principles of good government as believed in by
your ladyship’s family. You know in what sort of faith
I have been brought up. Moreover, I live in town among
a slow, hard-working set, who have neither time nor in-
clination for going to race-courses; and, indeed, I am-
now getting a little practice at the bar myself. If I were
a handsome young swell in a regiment of Light Dragoons,
then, instead of publishing that amusing work upon the
Law of Eutail, which, with a totally inexcusable pang, I
saw lying upon your library-table to-day um‘ut, I should
without doubt be making a betting-book. Having no
call towards that sort of employment, however, I am very
severe upon it. I term it waste of time, loss of money,
&c. ,- and in the case of your son, I have even been so
foolish as to remonstrate with him on that very account
-—an interference which, I fear, has cost me his friend-
ship." >
"' Has he lost money through this man Derrick, think
you P ”
“ Not yet, or they would not be upon such good terms.
A turf friendship ceases at the ﬁrst bad bet. The fact is,
it was about his intimacy with this drunken fellow that I
ventured to speak ; it increases the misunderstanding
already unhappily existing between your sons; for you
know what a dislike Sir Richard has shown for this person,

while for Walter himself I believe him to be a most dan-
gerous acquaintance.”
“ Dangerous ?” inquired my lady hurriedly—“ how
mean you dangerous P”
“ He is bad company for any young man, and he has
acquaintances who are worse. Walter is ‘ hail-fellow-well-
met’ with everybody, and may ﬁnd himself one day so
deeply involved with these folks, that extrication may not
be easy. He has plenty of wits, and well knows how to
take care of himself in a general way: but all his great
advantages are useless to him among this particular class.
His genial wit, his graceful ways, his tenderness of heart
—nay, even his high spirits, all go for nothing with such
vulgar good-for-naughts, whom, in my opinion, he will be
lucky not to ﬁnd downright cheats and scoundrels."
“ Is this man Derrick, then,” inquired my lady, gazing
ﬁxedly upon the dark swirling stream, “ irredeemably base
and vicious P ” .
“ No, not so,” answered the young man frankly; “he
has the lees of good still left in him, without which, in-
deed, he would be less harmful. Walter was taken from
the ﬁrst with his openness and candour—which are so
great that he seems quite lost to the sense of shame—and
with his lavish generosity, which is probably the result of
rapid fortune making. He made ﬁve'thousand pounds
or so, it seems, in a few weeks at gold-digging, and I
should think he was in a fair way to spend it in almost
as short a period."
“ Perhaps he may have been spoilt by that mode of
life,” observed Lady Lisgard pitifully.
“ I speak as I ﬁnd, ma mbre," said the young man,
shrugging his shoulders. “ It is nothing to us if this man
may have been a good boy at one time. You may cha-
ritably suppose, if you like, that he has been crossed in
love, or unfortunately married— Ah ! that reminds
you, I see, of his tendrerre for Mistress Forest. Since it
moves you so deeply, you must look that matter in the
face, Lady Lisgard, and very soon, if you wish to keep

Mary. If something about this fellow pleases Walter, you
need not wonder that it has fascinated your waiting-
maid.”
“Is it this fancy of his, then, think you, which alone
. keeps him here at Mirk?” asked my lady, who had
started for a moment as though stung, but was now once
more looking thoughtfully at the river.
“No.' Being totally without anchorage in the world,
the cable-strand of a partnership in arace-horse at present
at Chifney’s stables here holds him to the place where he
can be near his property. His pecuniary affairs are; as I
understand, bound up in that four-footed creature, and
beyond them he has nothing to look to. You who have
all things settled about you, Lady Lisgard, with home,
children, and friends, and from whom so many interests
radiate, are doubtless unable to picture to yourself such
a state of things. But if this man should marry Mis-
tress Forest, and still keep his share in Mae/aw, I
should not be surprised if he were to take up his residence
at Mirk altogether.”
“ God in his mercy forbid ! ” ejaculated my lady,
clasping her hands.
“My dear Lady Lisgard!” cried the young man, in
alarm at her emotion, “I am afraid I must have said
something very foolish, to have frightened you about this
fellow thus. After all, there is no harm done, and I
may have been very wrong—as my mind misgives me, I
have been very ofﬁcious—in anticipating any harm.”
“ No, no," cried my lady, rocking herself to and fro;
“your good sense has only told you truth. Do not—do
not forsake me, Arthur. I look to you not only for
warning, but for succour. Are you sure that you have
told me all? Is there no other reason besides those you
have mentioned why this man, having lain in wait, and
entrapped my Walter, should sit down before this house, A
and, as it were, besiege it thus?" ' i
“ Well, Lady Lisgard,” returned the young man
gravely, “there is, Ifear, another reason ,' but it 15 one I

am very loath to speak of—— Are you cold, ma mérei
I fear it is too early for this sitting by the river."
“ N0, Arthur, I am not cold. Why should you hesitate
to tell me anything about this—this stranger? "
“Because, Lady Lisgard, I respect you as though you
were indeed my mother—as you have shown towards me
always a mother’s love; and this matter in some sort
concerns yourself."
“Myself?” whispered my lady hoarsely. “ No, not
myself, good Arthur. What can there be in commor.
between this man—whom I have never seen—and me? ”
“Ay, there it is," replied the young man quietly. “ It
would have been far better had you not shut yourself up,
as you have done these three months, expressly to avoid
this fellow—by that means making him think himself of
consequence."
“Who says I have done that P” asked my lady vehe-
mently. “Who dares to say it? Why should I fear him ?
Why should I think about him well, or ill? What is he '
to me, or I to him?”
“ Ay, what indeed, ma mére/ All this arises from
giving ourselves such airs, and carrying matters with so
higha hand ; you have nothing but Sir Richard’s pride to
thank for it, to which I must say, in this instance, you
have injudiciously, and, most unlike yourself, succumbed.
It was a harsh measure, surely, to forbid this man your
house, when coming, as you knew he would, upon a
lawful errand of courtship; but to serve the landlord of
an inn with notice of ejectment if a certain guest
should not remove himself—which your eldest son has
caused to be done with Steve—is a most monstrous ex~
ercise of authority. No wonder this Derrick was greatly
irritated ; any man so treated would be ; but, in the pre-
sent case, Sir Richard has made the unhappiest mistake.
He is dealing with one who is to the full as obstinate as
himself ; and (what makes the odds orcrwhelmingly
against him) a man entirely reckless and unprincipled.
Your son does not understand how anyone can be proud

who is not a gentleman. Now, this fellow is possessed of
a very devil of pride. He is come from an outlying
colony, where there is conventional respect for nothing;
and where every man does pretty much what is right in
his own eyes. He has been lucky there; raised by a
freak of fortune, and not by plodding industry (although
he has doubtless worked hard too), to comparative wealth,
he is by no means inclined to consider people his super-
iors. A beggar on horseback if you will, he is still
mounted, and may ride in Rotten Row itself if it pleases
him. He resents, of course, being thus meddled with;
he is one of that class who would deem it a great liberty
in the law should it punish his actual transgressions—
who would think it hard to be smitten for his faults—
but to be interfered with in a harmless avocation, such as
love-making. or to be dictated to as to where he is to
reside, stirs his bile, I can imagine, pretty considerably.
It is my belief that he would have got tired of Mirk and
Mary too before this, and wandered off somewhere else,
scattering his bank-notes on the way, poor devil, like the
hare in a school-boy’s paper chase, but for this unjustiﬁ-
able attempt on the part of Sir Richard to curtail his
liberties. I am sure, also, that Walter was at ﬁrst in-
clined to patronise this man, for the very reason that his
brother had exhibited towards him such uncalled-for
animosity."
“This may be all very true,” said my lady, sighing,
but at the same time not without a certain air of relief;
“ but I cannot understand how it affects me, Arthur.”
“Well, you see, my dear Lady Lisgard, although Sir
Richard issues these foolish edicts, it is you who are re-
sponsible for them; and I have no doubt this Derrick
has been told as much. At least, I hear that over his cups
he has declared he will never leave Mirk till he has had a.
sight of this Queen of all the R00sias (as he terms you),
who holds herself 50—- Pardon me, ma mt‘rc; I was
wrong to repeat this fellow’s impertinence. Heaven help
us! Why, my lady has fainted ! ”

Arthur Haldane spoke the truth. For the moment,
Lady Lisgard’s mind was freed from all its anxieties, of
whatever nature they might be. The young man sprang
down the bank, and dipping his handkerchief in the stream,
applied its wet folds to her forehead. Gradual and slow
the lifeblood ﬂowed again, and with it thought, although
confused and tangled.
“Save me, save my Walter!” murmured she. “Tell
him I will die ﬁrst. He shall never look upon my face."
“He never shall, ma mére,” said the young man sooth-
ingly, while he chafed my lady’s stiffened ﬁngers.
“ Keep him away ! " cried she, endeavouring to rise;
“ he is tearing off my wedding-ring. Help! help! ”
“ No, no, it is not he ; it is I, Arthur Haldane—a well-
meaning fool, but who has worked a deal of mischief. I
have told you all I know, and I wish my tongue had
been cut out ﬁrst. It makes my heart bleed to see you
thus distressed."
“Then give me comfort, Arthur,” groaned my lady;
“you have warned me well, but what is the use of wam-
ing without advice ? How shall I make him cease to
persecute us P Gold will not buy him. I have heard of
such a man, who, being bribed, cried but the more ‘ Give,
give ; ’ as the whirlpool swallows ship after ship, and yet
gapes for more—for navies."
“ Bribe him P No, Heaven forbid I That, indeed,
would be the very way to keep him what he is—to make
that chronic which is now, let us hope, but a passing ail-
ment. But I would take care, if I were you, that nothing
further be done to irritate him. He may revenge himself
—-I only say he may—by doing Walter some ill turn.
.And, above all, you must persuade Mistress Forest to
give him his congé. If once you get her to say ‘No,’ of
her own free will, he will soon tire of haunting the Abbey;
while, if his race-horse does not do the great things ex—
pected of him—and what race-horse ever did ?-—he will
soon tire of Mirk itself.”
My lady shook her head. A,

“Come, ma mt‘re, there is no need for despondency
about this fellow’s going—nor, indeed, for much appre-
hension if he stays—and, moreover, I really think the
matter lies in your own hands; at all events, you have
more inﬂuence over your waiting-maid than anyone else,
and my advice is that you speak to her at once.”
“Yes, I will speak to her," said Lady Lisgard me-
chanically. “Thank you, good Arthur, much." She
rose from her seat, and heaving a deep sigh as she turned
from the fair home-scene, was about to saunter to the
beech-walk, when the young man laid his hand upon
her arm. It was the lightest touch, but, like that of an
enchanter’s wand, it seemed to remove all trace of
selﬁsh trouble, and in its place to evoke the tenderest
sympathy for another.
“You wish to speak to me upon your own account,
dear boy 3 and, alas! I know the subject you would
choose.”
“Alar, ma mére/ why alas? I want to talk to you
about your Letty.”
“Not, now, not now,” cried Lady Lisgard. “Spare
me, dear Arthur, for this time; I feel so unhinged and
woe-stricken, I can give you neither ‘ Yea’ nor ‘Nay.’ "
“ I hoped that you would not have thought of ‘ Nay,’
dear Lady Lisgard," said the young man pathetically. “I
did not look for the same cruel arguments of difference
of station and the like from you as from—others. I shall
have a home to offer your daughter such as will be want-
ing in no comfort, although it may not be one so fair as
yonder Abbey. My professional prospects are, I am
glad to say "
“It is not t/lal, dear boy," broke in Lady Lisgard
hastily. ‘“ You should know me better than to suppose
so, Arthur; yet I cannot, nay, I dare not tell you what
it is. It may be you will hear the truth some day, though
never from these lips; it may be—I pray Heaven for
that—that you will never need to hear it. But for the
present, press me for no reply; for when you ask to be

my daughter‘s husband, Arthur Haldane, you know not
what you ask." ‘
“That is what Sir Richard says,” replied the young
man bitterly. “The Lisgards are such an ancient race,
their blood so pure, their scutcheon "
“Spare me, spare me, Arthur l" cried my lady
earnestly. “Give me only time, and I will do my best.
If I have said anything to wound you, ah! forgive it for
the sake of those old times, which you may think of some
day, boy, not without tears, when I shall be to you but a
memory. Think then—whatever’s said—‘Well, she was
always kind to me ; and when I wooed her daughter
(you will own) she was kind too, although I did not
think so then.’ " My lady’s face was hidden in her hands,
but through the fair white ﬁngers, as though the diamonds
in her rings had started from their sockets, oozed the
large tears.
“Dear Lady Lisgard, good, kind friend, ma- mére,” ex-
claimed the young man, deeply moved, “what sorrow is
it which overwhelms you thus P I pray you let me share
it. I am young and strong, and I love you and yours,
and there is help in me. Come, let me try."
“ No, Arthur, no,” answered my lady gravely, as she once
more arose, and re-entered the beech-walk. “I must
bear my own burden—that is only right and ﬁtting.
Heaven knows I am willing to suffer to the uttermost, if
I be only permitted to suffer alone. It is when the
innocent suffer for us that the burden galls the most. '
N o ; you can do nothing for me but keep silence about
all that we have spoken of to-day. Not to do so, would
be to do me a grievous hurt. You have passed your
word, Arthur Haldane—remember that.”
“ Yes, ma mérz'," replied the young man sighing. “ The
Haldanes always keep their promises, you know.”

CHAPTER IX.
IN THE LIBRARY.
~ F all the pleasant rooms—and they were many—
that were to be found at Mirk Abbey, the
library was by far the most charming. An
architect might have said that the rest of the
house had been somewhat sacriﬁced to it ; a bookworm
might have wished it gloomier and more retired ; but for
a lover of literature who was also a judge of beauty, it
was well-nigh perfect. It was upon the ﬁrst ﬂoor, and
occupied the space of at least three reception-rooms.
Long as it was, its excessive breadth might have been
objected to, but that the eﬁect of this was diminished to
exactly the right proportions by huge double bookcases,
which jutted out at right angles from the walls ; thus the
place was broken up, as it were, into a number of little
studies, closed in upon three sides, but open, of course,
towards what in a church would be called the aisle. This
aisle, still a broad space, was set alternately with flower-
vases and statues of white marble, though none of these
were so tall as to hide from one standing at the door the
view of the huge painted window at the southern end.
In summer-time, this window was swung back, and all the
garden scents and drowsy sounds—the level sweep of the
scythe upon the lawn, and the murmur of the bees in the
limes—were srrﬁered to enter in. In winter, being closed,
what light there was came glowing through the pictured

panes, or through small windows far above the level of
the eye, so that, in that well-warmed room, you could not
tell that it was winter.
And yet this stately apartment was seldom used in
either season. Letty would sometimes take a godly
book from that part of the place marked in dull gold
Devotional, but always carried it away to read in her own
chamber; and Sir Richard now and then would refresh
himself in the topographical department by taking down
the JYzlttory 0f W/leatrlzire, where all the Family Seats
were duly pictured, and the linked sweetness of the
genealogy of the owners long drawn out ; but the
Lisgards were not a reading race. Moreover, when they
did read, it was chieﬂy out of modern books temporarily
supplied by Mr. Mudie, or works most glorious to behold
as to their bindings, and without which no lady’s draw-
ing-room can be said to be complete, but which happily
are rarely seen in libraries. My lady herself had a goodly
store of books in her own boudoir, including most of the
French and English classics, all presented to her at divers
times by her late husband, and all read, if not for her
own pleasure, then for his ; she therefore visited the
library more rarely than anyone except Walter, who
would as soon have thought of visiting the laundry. The
last time she had gone thither was just after Miss Aynton’s
ﬁrst arrival, when she had taken that young lady to see
some curious missals there deposited, containing certain
initial letters which Rose was desirous of copying.
She enters it now alone upon her return from that
interview with Arthur Haldane at the Watersmeet—on a
very diﬁ'erent errand. She is no longer the kind of some-
what stately hostess, doing her young guest a pleasure,
and at the same time perhaps taking a pardonablew pride
in showing her the gem of the Abbey—its library—for
the ﬁrst time. All pride, all stateliness, seem to have
departed from that anxious face ; her ﬁgure, however, is
erect as of old, and her step as ﬁrm, as she closes the
door of the vast room behind her, and walks towards its

southern end. She looks neither to left nor right, for
she is in search of none of those volumes which line the
library on either side. The place for which she is bound
is in a far corner next the window, but very indirectly
lighted by it ; a small “ study," where, if such a thing as
dust were permitted to accumulate at the Abbey at all,
it would certainly lie; and where it did lie; a spot un-
visited for years, ever since it had been detemiined that
Sir Richard’s profession should be the Law, when certain
books were taken from it, and carried up to town to stock
his chambers ; for over this little literary den was written
Legal. Truly, as the phrase goes, “it was not a place
for a lady," that dusky little chamber, lined with its
bulky, calf-bound volumes, mostly in series, and often as
not connected with one another by that emblem of their
contents, a spider’s web. What could my lady have come
hither to cull from such unpromising books? Is it possi-
ble that, unmindful of the proverb, that he who is his
own lawyer has got a fool for his client, she can be in
search of legal advice gratis? It is plain that she is in
doubt, alas, even where to ﬁnd the information of which
she is in search. Her soft white hand wanders from
tome to tome, and drags down one after another from its
dusty shelf, until she has peopled the sunbeams anew
with motes 3 but her large gray eyes ﬁnd nothing to arrest
them as they wander over the arid pages, although they
grow weary with their task.
At last, however, they seem to have been more for-
tunate. For the ﬁrst time, my lady takes her seat beside
the slanting desk, and with her head supported by her
hands, like one who is in need of all her wits, she
reads on patiently enough. She cons the matter over
twice or thrice, then sighs, and putting a thin slip
of paper in the book to mark the place, returns it to
its shelf, and pursues her search as before. Out of
several score of volumes, four only seem to have served
her purpose, and even from them it is evident that
she has gleaned no comfort, but rather conﬁrmation of

some fear. Her face is more hopeless than it was a
while ago; her sigh—and she sighs deep and often—has
despair in it, as well as sorrow. From her wearied eyes,
'as she gazes upon the opened casement—through which
comes a dreamy music in the ﬂutter of the young leaves
on a neighbouring elm, and the silver leap of the fountain
on the lawn—tear follows tear, although she knows it
not, and glides down the new-made furrows in her
checks.
The luncheon gong was beaten an hour ago, and then
was taken out into the garden for her especial behoof,
and beaten again; but my lady heard it not. She has
neither eyes nor ears for the Present at all. She is think-
ing of some Future more dark and terrible than death
itself, a day of dishonour and' disgrace, that is creeping
slowly but surely upon her and hers. The young leaves
babble of it already, and the fountain with its talking
water, and every whispering breath of April wind; and
now she listens to them; and now she tries in vain to
think and think; and now she listens to them perforce
again. They are comforters these mysterious voices,- and
do but pretend to prattle of her woes, in order that they
may woo her to oblivion; for presently the tired arms
can no more bear the burden of that piteous face, but
sink down on the desk, and on those soft and rounded
cushions droops the careworn head; and the eyelids
that have scarce shut throughout the livelong night, nor
through many a night before, are closed in slumber. The
ee-music, the falling water, and the lullaby of the April
leaves, through Nature’s kindly hands, have given my
lady a nepenthe draught ; and, thanks to it, she has for-
gotten her woes; nay, more, it has substituted for them
joys borrowed from the unreturning past, which, while
we tarry in dreamland, are as real as any.
My lady is once more a ﬁshermun's daughter, upon the
banks of Blea. The river that ﬂows beside her father’s
door is almost as salt as the sea itself, and twice a day
the sea itself comes up and ﬁlls the creeks, and sets

aﬂoat the boats and colliers that lie sideways on the cozy
beach. When it retires, she longs to be taken with it,
for ere that tide can reach the open sea, it must needs
pass by the port of Bleamouth, where her lover Ralph
dwells. Young as she is, she has been wooed by others,
and they better matches than this roving sailor, who,
although he has saved a little money, does not know,
says her father, how to keep it 3 and when that is gone,
how will he keep himself save by going to sea again;
much more, then, how will he keep his wife Lucy and a
household P But these wise sayings are naught in Lucy’s
ears, in which love whispers always its smooth prophecies,
and Ralph’s rich laugh dispels the old man’s forebodiugs,
or plays upon them as though they were the very strings
of mirth.
As handsome and stout-hearted a lad he is as ever was
ﬁtted to make his own way through the world ; able
enough to thrust to left and right all jostling compeers,
and by no means one to lack or to let those dear to him
lack, while bread is to be got by sweat of brow. A smile
comes over my lady’s face, and makes it young again, the
while she dreams; for now she sees his signals in the
coming boat, and now himself, and now he leaps ashore,
and clasps her with his stalwart arm, and now her ﬁngers
play with the dark locks that curl above his tanned and
manly brow. ’Tis more than half a lifetime back—but
she knows not that—and the colour comes again to the
wan cheek as though it were a maiden's, and once more
love awakens in her widowed heart. He speaks ; but ere
his tongue can shape the words, a sense of doubt begins
to perplex and pain her. She is a girl, and yet a woman
in the vale of years; a ﬁsher’s daughter though a lady
bred, with all the circumstances of rank and wealth about
her ; the voice is her lover’s voice, and yet sounds
strangely like another’s ; she is on the borderland ’twixt
waking and sleeping, where, as in a dissolving view, the
coming and the passing pictures interlace and exchange
features, and the dream and the reality struggle together

for life. Some one is speaking, however, that is certain,
and the voice, as no woman can doubt, is tremulous and
love-laden.
“And yet, Rose—for I may call you Rose, mayI not?
—beautiful as these pictures are, I do not think they are
more exquisite than those which you have painted yourself.”
“You ﬂatter me, Sir Richard," returned a second
voice, with which my lady was no better acquainted than
with the ﬁrst ; for although she could not but be aware of
who the speakers were, since they addressed one another
by their names, she did not recognise her own son’s
speech, so changed it was from its ordinary polite but
icy tones; while Rose Aynton’s, upon the other hand,
generally so quiet and submissive, were tinged with a
mocking bitterness. If Sir Richard Lisgard was really
about to lay his fortune at the feet of this penniless girl,
it seemed strange indeed that she should reply to him in
so unnatural a key. That the delirious joy that might
well be at her heart should not be altogether repressible,
was to be expected, and that her tongue should falter in
endeavouring to conceal her triumph ; but there was that
in the young girl’s accents different from anything that
could be thus explained. Instead of trembling and
hesitation in her speech, there was sheer scorn. Per-
haps my lady should have come forth at once from
where she sat an involuntary eaves-dropper; but it
must be allowed that the temptation to remain was very
great. Moreover, there were reasons why she could not
explain her own presence in that particular portion of
the library; and again, should she disclose herself, the
young people would feel no less uncomfortable 'than
though they should even discover at last that their inter-
view had not been so solitary as they imagined, for how
did she know what had occurred while she was sleeping,
and how should she persuade Miss Rose, even if her
word was sufﬁcient for Richard, that she lum' been sleep-
ing during that critical period? True, if it was certain
that the offer about to be made would be accepted, as

indeed there was every likelihood that it would be, it
was highly expedient—for various reasons known to my
lady—that she should step forward, and prevent matters
from going further; but so strange did the girl's voice
strike upon her experienced ear, that Lady Lisgard
waited in hopes of she scarce knew what—some almost
miracle that might make her personal interposition un-
necessary. At the same time her curiosity became so
excessive during the protracted pause that followed
Rose's “You ﬂatter me,” that she ventured to peer
round the comer of the recess wherein she sat, which
was now far more in shade than when she had entered it
at noon.
They were standing not very far from her—those two
unconscious young people—in front of a huge portfolio,
which leant against a statue of Cupid and Psyche. The
old, old tale of love which the sculpture typiﬁed was
evidently being anew repeated by one at least of the
living pair. Sir Richard, who had been turning over the
pictures, kept his hand mechanically on one of them,
but his eyes were ﬁxed with a winning softness, which
even his mother had never seen in them before, upon his
fair companion. Through one of the small western
windows, the last gleam of the dying sun had found its
way, and rested upon his crisp brown curls; his manly
face glowed in a golden haze, while in his eyes there
beamed a light that no sun can give, and mellower than
the rays of moon or star.
“ I do not ﬂatter you, sweet Rose,” he said ; “I love
you." She too had one hand upon the picture, and but
for it, it seemed for a moment as though she would have
fallen, so deadly pale she grew the while he spoke. Her
eyelids quivered, and then slowly sank like two white
rose-leaves on her cheek; while her unoccupied hand
fell from her pale lips, and hung down by her side quite
motionless.
“She cannot give him nay,” thought Lady Lisgard;
“ the girl is overcome with her great joy.”

“ Why do you not speak, dear Rose ? " continued Sir
Richard ; “ or may I take your silence for consent, and
thus set loving seal "
He moved towards her, and round her dainty waist
had placed his arm, when she sprang from him like a
frightened fawn, who, although so seeming tame that it
,will hover nigh, and even follow one, darts off in terror
when we strive to caress it.
“No, Sir Richard no,” cried she; “ I cannot marry you
—I dare not ; and I will not. You are much too proud
and arrogant for me.”
“But not 1'0 you, Rose," pleaded the young man
earnestly. “You shall be my mistress, I your servant
always. If I have ever been proud to you, I pray you to
forgive it. I do beseech your pardon. It seemed at ﬁrst
that I was right to be so. You do not understand how.
one like me, so "
“ 50 well born and so rich,” interrupted the young girl
quietly, looking up into his face with steady gaze. “ Yes,
I understand that well, Sir Richard ; and I, on the other
hand, a dependent girl, so inferior to the sort of bride
that you had a right to look for ; it was well to keep me
at a respectful distance.”
“ No, not so, Rose," cried the other hastily ; “I swear
that you are inferior to no woman whom I have ever
seen. But I did not wish I thought at ﬁrst, that it
would not be for your happiness——”
“And your ﬁrst thought was right, Sir Richard,” broke
in the other bitterly. “When you said to yourself, I
will not encourage this young girl to think it possible
that she should ever be the mistress of Mirk Abbey, you
were wise. You did right to hold yourself aloof, to be-
have with studied stiffness and formality, to let me know
though I might worship your exalted station, and admire
your handsome face "
“ Rose ! Rose l"
“Ay, it is Rose now, but it was Miss Aynton then,”
continued she, beating her foot upon the ﬂoor. “You

determined, I say, within yourself that I should never so
forget our relative positions as to misconstrue any atten-
tions you might please to pay me 3 you held yourself
so high, and stooped so condescendingly when you did
stoop, that, upon my part at least, you resolved to nip the
young beginnings of love, if such there should be, in their
very bud. And, Sir Richard Lisgard, you succeeded." _
She rose to her full height and pointed at him with
her white hand contemptuously 3 her swan-like bosom
moved, with rapid ebb and ﬂow, in angry scorn; her
curling lips gave wormwood to her words. And yet,
although he felt her biting speech, the young man thought
he had never seen her half so beautiful, half so worthy
to be his wife.
“It is you who are proud now, Rose,” returned he,
speaking with effort. “I did not think that I could
ever have heard such words from a woman's lips, and
yet have sought to woo her. It is your turn to play the
tyrant;but though, by Heaven, you look every inch :1
queen—~-—"
“I thank you, Sir," interrupted the girl coldly; “but
you need say no more. There is no necessity to offer
me that one more chance which your generosity suggests
to you. However incomprehensible and audacious, com-
ing from these humble lips, may such an answer sound,
Sir Richard Lisgard is refused."
“ Rose, dear Rose,” cried the young man passionately;
“if this be punishment, do not push it, I pray you,
further than I can bear. There is something in your
face in-such ill accordance with your speech, that I can-
not yet despair. Is it not possible, sweet girl, that at
some future time—not now, but when you have seen how
humble and devoted I can be, that you may teach your
heart to love me P ”
“No.” A full and rounded word, without a flaw of
doubt to mar its clearness; a sentence irreversible; a
judgment against which he felt there could be no appeal.
“ But look you, Rose,” continued the baronet huskin ;

so Mrk Abbey.
“it is said that the true love grows after marriage. Sup-
pose I am content to wed you on that chance, as in very
truth I am. Look you, the scene is fair you behold through
yonder window, and all that you see is mine. The Abbey,
too, is mine, or will be so at my mother’s death." [A
shadow of pain flits across my lady's face, to hear her
son speak thus so lightly of that loss, to please a girl
whom he has not known six months, and who does not
even love him] “I have broad acres, girl, fields, farms
—a goodly rent-roll. My wife—the Lady Lisgard—will
have more than enough of wealth to maintain her high
position. Rose l have you no ambition? "
Miss Aynton here again grew strangely agitated ; once
more her cheeks grew pale, and her limbs trembled be-
neath her.
“ Wretched girl! can she indeed be going to sell her-
self P” thought my lady.
“There is nothing," pursued the wooer, perceiving his
advantage, “which will be out of your reach. You will
mix with those same persons to whose society you have
been already accustomed, but in a very different relation
towards them; you will be their equal in station, and
they will be compelled to acknowledge that superiority
in all other respects which they have refused to see in
you while a mere dependant on your aunt’s caprice. You
will be enabled, I do not say to repay scorn for scorn—
for yoursweet nature is incapable of such revenge—but
to extend to those who have wounded you forgiveness 5
to return each kindness ﬁftyfold."
" Sir Richard Lisgard,” replied the young girl, speak-
ing slowly, but with great distinctness, “my answer has
been given you already. It is true that your last argu-
ments moved me, but not for the reason you imagine. I
can marry you neither for love nor for money. You
pique yourself, I think, on being a gentleman; being so,
you will cease to press me further. I am conscious of the
honour you have done me in this matter, and I thank
you ; but I decline your offer.”

The young man bowed, but without speaking. His
features, which had softened to an extraordinary degree
throughout their interview, began to assume a look even
haughtier than before ; his pride was all the greater since
he had forced himself to stoop in vain.
“I have only one thing, then, to request, Miss
Aynton,” said be after a long silence. “ I trust that you
will not permit what has just occurred to curtail your
stay at Mirk. It is understood that you are to remain
here until after the celebration of—of my majority.” He
could scarcely get the word out, poor fellow: he had
looked forward so to her loving sympathy upon that
proud occasion, which now seemed emptied of all its
happy auguries.
“Do not fear, Sir Richard,” returned the girl with
pity ; “ no one shall know that the heir of Mirk has met
with this disappointment. I will remain here, since you
wish it. Your behaviour towards me needs no alteration
to conceal the fact that you have ever been my lover.”
He had once more so reinstated himself in his proof-
armour of pride, that the young baronet was not even
aware that this last shaft had any barb.
“I thank you, Miss Aynton,” said he frigidly ; “if at
any time it should be within my power to do you or
yours a service, please to command me to the utter-
most."
He bowed, and strode away; she heard him close the
door, neither softly nor in anger, and then his measured
step upon the carpetless oaken stair without.
“ I have not broken his heart, that's certain,” muttered
Rose Aynton, with a crooked smile; “the lover was lost
in the patron soon indeed."

CHAPTER X.
MISS ROSE AYNTON “ COMES OUT.”
OR some minutes there was a total silence in the
vast apartment, very oppressive to at least one
of the two persons present. “How long did
this proud girl intend to remain and keep her
a prisoner?” thought my lady. She was rejoiced that
Miss Aynton had refused her son, but at the same time
angry with her for having done 50. Rose must surely
have had some motive for it far deeper than the mere
revenging herself upon him for fancied slights. And
yet Letty, who was in the girl’s conﬁdence, seemed
certain that she had no accepted lover—n0 previous en-
gagement, such as alone seemed a sufﬁcient reason for re-
jecting so advantageous a proposal. Perhaps she was
even now repenting with tears the determination which
had earned for her so dearly-bought a triumph. My lady
ventured to look forth once more. Yes, the poor girl
was doubtless crying bitterly. Her face was hidden in
her hands, but there was a convulsive movement of the
round white shoulders that told its tale of inward grief.
“ Poor thing, poor thing ! " My lady’s kind heart yearned
towards her now that she was sorry for her treatment of
her son. Perhaps—not knowing Sir Richard as his
mother knew him—she might even now make some hope-
less endeavour to win him back to her. If she succeeded,
that would be the worst thing that could possibly happen ;

and if she failed—as was almost certain—then she would
have to suffer all this pain over again. Was it not my
lady’s duty, then, to do her best to spare this unhappy
motherless girl such bitter disappointment and humilia-
tion, and to comfort her all she could under her present
trouble? At all events, after some such manner Lady
Lisgard reasoned. She did not stop to think of herself at
all—of the imputation of eaves-dropping to which she must
necessarily expose herself—but stepped forth at once
from the recess, and walked quietly to where Rose was
standing. Her footsteps made no noise upon the thick
matting that was laid down' the centre of the polished
ﬂoor. As she approached the unconscious girl, she was
compelled to acknowledge to herself, for the ﬁrst time,
how strikingly attractive a young woman Miss Aynton
was. She had certainly not the beauty of my lady's own
daughter Letty, nor was she so tall, or perhaps so grace-
-ful ; but her ﬁgure, although it was one likely to get
coarse in time, was really perfect; her head, exquisitely
set on well-shaped shoulders, was small, but bore such a
profusion of black-brown hair as would have furnished
half-a-dozen ordinary young ladies with t/ulgnom; her
hands and arms were plump and white. Her eyes—Lady
Lisgard thought that she had never seen such wondrous
eyes as those which ﬂashed upon her now in sudden
recognition, then terror, then rage—not a trace of tears in
them, and all the white face cold and still, not puckered
up with woe, as she had expected to see it.
“So you have been a spectator, Lady Lisgard, of the
late love scene, have you?” said Rose Aynton in a low
and suppressed tone. “ That was very generous and like
a gentlewoman—in one’s hostess, too."
“Hush, Rose; do not say things that you may after-
wards be sorry for. I will tell you how it happened.”
“Nay, do not trouble yourself, my lady; I can guess.
You knew Sir Richard had made an appointment with me
here, and you wished to hear with what rapturous grati-
tude the penniless girl would consent to be his brrd:.

I hope you did hear, Madam, since you took such
trouble."
“ Yes, Rose, I did hear. Your cruel words shall not
rob you of my sympathy. I am sorry for my son, of
course ,' but I am sorry for you also. I had been worried,
vexed by many things of which it is not necessary to tell
you ; I came hither for solitude, and wearied out by many
a sleepless night—nights of care, girl, such as I trust you
may never know—I fell asleep in yonder recess. I never
heard you enter the room at all. I woke up while you
were speaking, but scarcely knew whether I ought to re-
veal myself or not. I heard you reject poor Richard;
then, when he had gone, I thought that you repented
having done so. I was moved at seeing you look so
white and still. I felt for you, Rose, with all my heart,
and came out, when I might as easily have remained con-
cealed, to try to comfort you. My poor dear girl ! "
“That was very kind,” returned Rose quietly. “ But
if I had behaved otherwise, would you then have wel-
comed me as your daughter-in-law? Please to tell me
that. ’
“If I should say ‘Yes,’ you would not believe me,
Rose. So why ask me such a question? Moreover, the
matter is settled now for ever. He would be a doting
lover, indeed, who would forgive such a repulse; and
Richard is the last man in all the world to do so.”
“ Do you think so? ” answered the young girl with an
incredulous smile. “You have forgotten surely your own
youth, Lady Lisgard.”
“What know you of my youth, girl P ” asked my lady
hastily, her pale face ﬂushing with emotion.
“Nay, do not be angry,” returned the other coldly.
“ I meant nothing, except that when a. woman is young she
is very powerful. You say that I have lost Sir Richard,
and therefore you pity me. Now, I will wager by this
time tomorrow that I could win him back again.”
Was this the humble and submissive girl who came to
Mirk four months ago, almost from school, and whom she

had treated as a mother treats her child P The conscious
belle of a London season could not have spoken with a
greater conﬁdence; the most practised husband-hunter
with a cooler calculation. “ Come," continued Rose,
“if you really are so sorry for me, Lady Lisgard, and so
distressed upon your son’s account, have I your per-
mission to do my best to repair this common mis-
fortune P”
My lady could scarce conceal a shudder at the thought
how nearly had this cold-blooded scheming girl become
her daughter-in-law. Whatever objections she might have
had to such a match before—and they were in themselves
insuperable—seemed to have grown to twice their former
proportions. The girl’s determination and self-conﬁdence
alarmed her, too, for that result about which she had be-
fore felt so certain. At all hazards, she was resolved to
prevent an attempt at reconciliation being made.
“ N0, Rose ; I do not wish you to try to recover the
affections of Sir Richard.”
“ So, so 3 then we have the truth at last, Lady Lisgard.
You are not willing that I should be daughter-in-law of
yours. You grudge me such great good-fortune as to be
allied with the race of Lisgards: and yet it fell to your
own lot—as I have heard—even in a more unexpected
manner."
“Miss Aynton, what I was is no affair of yours," re-
plied my lady with quivering lips. “You have only to
remember what I am.” '
“ I do so, Madam, very well. I see you held in honour
by all people, and without doubt, justly. Your position
is indeed to me an object of admiration, perhaps, I may
add, even of envy. Is it not natural that it should be so ?
And when your son offers to lift me from my present low
estate to place me as high, why should I hesitate to take
advantage of such a proposal? I have refused him, it is
true 3 but now, being, as you say, repentant, why should I
not strive to recover what I have let slip—wealth, honours,
title "

“Rose Aynton," returned my lady, clasping the girl’s
white wrist, and speaking in very earnest but broken
tones, “ I warn you, do not do it. Even if you succeed,
you may not win all you dream of. Strive not, I charge
you, for your own sake, to undo what has been done. I
have reasons for what I say beyond any that you can
guess. If you would be happy, do not endeavour to ally
yourself with this family.”
“ Lady Lisgard, what can you mean P " ejaculated the
girl, her white face ﬂushed at last, her wide ﬂashing eyes
no longer hard and cynical, and her every feature im-
patient for reply.
“ I mean simply what I say. Seek not to be Richard’s
wife. If you want money—and I know from your own
lips it is not love which prompts you—you shall have
such wealth as is mine to give. I had meant it for a
different purpose; but that is no matter. Only do not
seek to win back my son ,' and when you leave us, I will
bless you for your forbearance—and for your silence,
Rose.”
“ Yes, Lady Lisgard, I will say nothing of all this,” re-
turned the girl thoughtfully, after a short pause. “ I
promise you, too, that I will never speak of love to Sir
Richard further ; and as for your offer of a bribe, though
I do not know that I have ever shown myself so greedy
as to deserve it—I will forgive you even that."
“Thank you, thank you, Rose,” answered my lady
eagerly. “I dare say, in my haste and trouble, I may
have said things to offend you, and if so, I am very sorry.
You have doubtless your troubles too."
“ Yes, I have,” answered the girl gravely ; “and I
should like to be alone with them for a little, Lady Lis-
gard, unless you have anything else to ask of me.”
“Nothing, Rose—nothing; you have granted all I
wished. You will be as undisturbed here as in your own
apartment ; nay, even more so ; for Letty will not think
of coming here to seek you out. Nobody ever comes
into the library."

My lady leaned forward as she spoke, and kissed the
girl’s smooth brow, cold as a tablet of alabaster, then
softly left the room.
Rose Aynton stood for a full minute, listening, eager
and motionless as Echo herself, before she stepped to the
door, and turned the key.
“No more spying, my lady!” ejaculated she; “my
hostess has her secrets, it seems, as well as I. It would
be well if I could discover hers before she found out
mine. What could she mean by cautioning me, for my
own sake, not to ally myself with the Lisgards? She is
not a fool to think to frighten me with a mere gipsy’s
waming—threatening much, but meaning nothing. What
reasons can those be against my becoming her daughter-
in-law, which are ‘beyond any that I can guess?’ If I
could only get this proud dame beneath my thumb, then,
indeed, I might recompense myself somewhat for having
missed Sir Richard. To think that I should have lost a
prize like that through mere humility of mind ! ‘Yet even if
you succeed,’ said she, ‘ you may not win all you dream of.’
Those were her very words. ‘ Haste and trouble ’ alone
could never have suggested them to her, although they may
have made her indiscreet enough to utter them. What
has put my lady in such low spirits of late, and kept her
so moped up within the Abbey walls? How came she
alone here in this place, whither, as she says, ‘No one
ever comes?’ She must have been hidden in yonder
recess in the far comer, or we must needs have seen
her, when my love-sick swain and I were walking up
and down."
Swift and noiseless, like some beautiful wild beast
upon the trail, Rose Aynton crossed the room, and
scanned, with a cruel look in her dark eyes, the little
study over which was printed Legal.
“I never heard that my lady was given to law,”
muttered she derisively. “True, she said that she had
been sent to sleep, a thing which anyone of these
folios one might think would compass. But why did

she come hither to read at all? There must have been
something of interest to attract her. The books on this
side do not seem to have been touched for ages , but
here—yes, some one has been to these quite lately, for
the dust has been disturbed, and here, if I mistake not,
IS the dainty print of my lady's ﬁngers. We are getting
warm, as the children say at hide-and-seek. What
have we here? A slip of paper for a marker, torn
cross-wise from an envelope with Lad upon it. It was
surely imprudent of my lady to use her own address
for such a purpose. le'llrl Ah, she has been studying
the art of making wills, I dare say. Considering Sir
Richard is already so well off—and since I am not to be
his wife—it is to be hoped she will leave her money to
son Walter ; and some, too, to poor dear Letty, for she is
one who will never learn to help herself in this world. It
is well for her that she has not to live by her wits. If she
had been in my position, she would have been a gover-
ness. Yes, it’s all about Wills, this book. And why
should not my lady make a will, being of ripe age,
and yet not old enough to sniff that smell of the
charnel-house, which renders the operation so unpleasant
a duty to the aged? I am afraid~unless, indeed, I
could ﬁnd the will itself—that I have but discovered
a mare’s nest after all. However, here are more book-
markers; come, let us combine our infomiation. Sut-

The girl stepped swiftly to the open window, and
pushed the heavy folds of hair behind her ears. “I feel
my blood all rushing to my brain, and roaring ‘ Ruin l ’ ”
murmured she. “If this sudden fear has any real
foundation, then indeed am I hoist with my own petard.
No wonder she warned me against alliance with her race,
if what I here suspect is true. They will need well-born
suitors themselves, she meant, to make up for what is
lacking in their blood, and mayhap money too. The

themselves in the world, these Lisgards ; but the title—
that would be lost, of course. That’s what she hinted
when she said I might not gain the thing I counted on,
even though I won Sir Richard. He cannot know of
it ; he could not be so proud if he had the least suspicion
of any blot in his own scutcheon. How he would
wither if one said to him: ‘Thou Bastard!’ And yet
I gravely doubt whether this discreet Madam, his
mother, has not one day tripped. ‘What know you
of my youth, girl?’ cried she a while ago, white, as I
thought, with anger; but it was fear, it seems. She
comes here alone to ﬁnd out for herself by study what
secret course to follow, or what hidden dangers to avoid,
having no counsellor in whom she can conﬁde. gThat
seems so for certain, or she would surely ask her son
himself, being a lawyer, or that wise Mr. Arthur Haldane,
whom I so honestly dislike, for their advice. It may be
all this bodes as ill for Walter as for his brother; it may
be that it bodes the younger the best of fortune, and the
elder the worst. That would be a brave day, indeed,
for some one, on which the proud young baronet should
sink to plain Mr. Richard, and the poor captain rise to
be Sir Walter Lisgard! And, again, there may be no-
thing in all this, after all. Time will doubtless show,
and it shall be my task to hurry Time’s footsteps towards
the discovery.”

CHAPTER XI.
UP EARLY.
T has been justly observed that one half of the
)8 world does not know how the other half lives.
‘ The statement is a very safe one, and might
have been made a great deal more compre-
hensive by the philosopher who uttered it without risk-
ing his reputation for sagacity. We do not know how
our next-door neighbour lives, except in the sense of
what he has for dinner, which may indeed be discovered
by the curious; nay, we often know not how our own
household lives, how our very sons conduct themselves
when not at meal-times and under our very eyes, what
pursuits they really follow, what hopes, what fears, what
ambitions they in secret entertain. It is well, indeed,
and should be a matter of congratulation, if we are quite
cognizant of the “goings on ” of our wives and
daughters. It is strange to think what a world in little
lies under the roof of any great mansion, such as Mirk
Abbey. How interesting would the genuine individual
biographies—if one could only get at them—of such a
household be, from that of the mistress of the establish-
ment (whose troubles we are endeavouring to portray)
down to that of the under kitchen-maid, concerning whom
we have “no information," but who has doubtless, her
own temptations, wrongs and troubles also, which con-
cern her with equal nearness, although they may not be so

genteel! It is probable that the true history of the
second gravedigger in Ham/at would be to the full as
interesting as what we know of that philosophic prince
himself, though his father had not been murdered by his
uncle, albeit even that may have been the case, for aught
we know. But, alasl the novelist has not the power
which the Devil on Two Stick: possessed of lifting the
tiles off the attics; but has generally to content himself
with such glimpses as he can obtain through the key-
holes of the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors.
Taking advantage of even this moderate privilege, we
are sometimes rewarded with phenomena. Thus, it is
little less than a portent to see Captain Walter Lisgard,
who is not generally addicted to early rising, up and
dressed upon a certain May morning before the clock on
the great stairs has sounded three. True, he has been
out of bed once or twice at such an hour on other
occasions, but then it was because he had not retired to
rest the night before. He has done that, however, this
time, or, at all events, has exchanged his evening-dress
for morning-costume. Some people do get up at the
most premature hours, even in winter, and light their
own ﬁres, and retrim the midnight lamp to pursue
literary or scientiﬁc labours ; but if Captain Lisgard has
got up to study, we will eat him. What am he be about?
He gropes his way down the great staircase, where dark-
ness is made visible by streaks of grayish light—which is
not yet dawn—struggling through cracks and crannies;
and he stumbles over the heavy rug beneath the bottom
step, and swears with involuntary emphasis. Then he listens
a while, to see what will come of that. The great clock
on the hall-table ticks reprovingly: “Don’t, don't—-
shame, shame!” as he never heard it tick before; and
here and there breaks forth an expostulatory creaking, as
though from moral furniture, which has no such scruples
in the daytime; but his ejaculation has aroused no living
being.
Softly he turns the key of the front-door, softly with-

draws the bolts, and would as softly have slipped out,
but that there is suddenly a jar and a whir, and the
opening door is held fast by an iron hand. “ Confound
the chain ! " exclaims the captain. “ It is as difﬁcult to
get out of this house as out of Newgate.” Then, when
all is still quiet, he emerges upon the stone steps with an
“I wonder, for my part, how burglars are ever dis-
covered," and takes his way towards the village. The
gates are locked at the end of the avenue, and the porter
and his wife are doubtless fast asleep, as well as fair-
haired Polly—dreaming perhaps of himself, thinks the
captain with a half-contemptuous, half-complacent smile
—but Master Walter, who is as active as a cat, climbs
the stone pillar by help of the iron hinge, and “ drops "
noiselessly on to the road. He passes up the humble
street, where each cottage is quiet as the grave—two
blessed hours intervening yet between its inmates and
their toil, and makes for the Lisgard Arms. The inn
stands on a slight elevation, so that he sees it some time
before he nears it. “ Why, the place is on ﬁre l" mutters
the captain; and certainly there is some extraordinary
illumination taking place in one of the apartments. A
ﬂood of light pours from it as from some Pharos, as
though to beckon benighted folks whither good ale is to
be found; and yet the house is always shut at eleven, in
conformity with the squire's orders.
“ It's that infernal idiot Derrick himself who has done
it," continues the captain. “That’s his room, I know.
Just as if he could not have got up in the dark, as I
did: a fellow that probably never had more than a
farthing-dip to light him any morning, before he went to
Cariboo. I wonder, for my part, he can dress without a
valet. What a stuck-up, vulgar dog it is ! How I hate
his pinchbeck Ostentation, and still worse, his dreadful
familiarity! If it could only be found out immediately
after this Derby that he was a returned transport, with ﬁve-
and-twenty years or so of his sentence still unexpired, how
delightful it would be! I really think that he is least

objectionable in the evenings, when he is drunk. There
is something original in his brute-manner of swilling; a
sort of over-driven-ox style about his stagger, which
would make his fortune upon any stage—where there
was room enough for the magnitude of the exhibition.
Certainly, one has to pay for the seciety of this sort of
gentry, and still more for their friendship. Alas, that I
should have made this fortunate savage fond of me ! I
wish I could feel as Valentine did with Orson, instead
of being much more like the too ingenious Frankenstein,
whose monster became his master. However, that has
not come about yet—notwithstanding meddling Mr.
Arthur Haldane’s warnings—Let me see, it was arranged,
I think, that I was to whistle to this animal." Master
Walter drew a silver cab-call from his pocket, and
executed upon it the disconsolate cry of one who in '
London streets between the closing of the night-houses
and the rising of the sun desires a Hansom. Instantly
the light from the inn began to diminish—once, twice,
thrice ; and then the easement became blind and rayless
like the other windows. “That beggar had four candles
lit!” ejaculated the captain with irritation. “ It was a mercy
that he did not bring out the village ﬁre-engine. Here
he comes with his eternal pipe, too. I dare say he had
the impudence to light that before he left the house, and
Steve's red nose will smell it."
There are some men who always look the same no
matter at what hour you come upon them: fresh, and
hearty, and strong, they have but to duck their heads in
cold water, and straightway the fatigues of a weary day
or a sleepless night are utterly obliterated. They rejoice
like giants to run their courses without any sort of
preparation in the way of food and sleep, such as the
rest of mankind require. Against this healthy animalism
we protest, by calling it rude health ; and to those who
are of a less powerful constitution, it is naturally an
offensive spectacle. Walter Lisgard had himself by no
means a delicate organisation; his complexion, though

pale, was far from sickly; his limbs, though models of
grace rather than of strength, were of good proportions
and well knit. But he was conscious of looking heavy-
eyed and haggard, and he secretly resented the robust
and ﬂorid appearance of the unconscious individual who
now joined him—a man at least twenty-ﬁve years his
senior.
“I suppose you have been accustomed to get up at
these unearthly hours at the gold-diggings, that you look
so disagreeably wide-awake, Mr. Derrick,” grumbled he.
“You would very much oblige me if you would but
yawn."
“Get up! Master Walter; why, I’ve never been to
bed," answered the bearded man with a great guffaw.
“The fact is, that I took a little more than was good for
me last night, and I did not dare lie down, knowing that
we had this business on hand so early.”
“Why, one would think, by the amount of light, that
you had been lying in state, like some deceased king of
the Cannibal Islands,” returned the other peevishly.
“Was it your habit to use two pair of candles in your
bed-room in Cariboo P”
“Well, I never had a bed-room there, that you would
call such, as I have told you again and again, Master
Walter; but I have burned twenty candles at a time
when they were selling at Antler Creek at ﬁve dollars a
pound. You imagine, I suppose, that it is only you
gentlemen who live at home at case who have money to
spend; but let me tell you that is not the case. I wiil
go bail for my part, for example, that I have paid more
sovereigns away in twenty-four hours than your brother,
Sir Richard, ever did in a week."
“My dear Mr. Derrick, you are boastful this morning,”
said the captain quietly : “it is my belief that you have
taken a hair of the dog that bit you overnight.”
. “ Maybe I have, and maybe I haven’t, Master Walter;
but I shall burn just as many candles as I like. I have
worked hard enough for my money, and, dam’me, but

I’ll enjoy it. Why, when I was at New Westminster, I
had my horse shod with gold, Sir ; and if I choose, I’ll
do it here.”
“ You would have a perfect right so to do, Mr. Derrick,"
returned the other gravely; “and for my part, if your
horse should cast a shoe in my neighbourhood, I should
warmly applaud your expensive tastes. But you must
have been really very rich, to do such things. Now, how
much do you think you were worth when you were at
New Westminster? ”
“That's tellings, captain,” responded the other with a
cunning chuckle ; “but when I was on Fraser River, me
and my mate Blanquette, we made "
“Well, now, what did you make P” urged the young
man, as the other hesitated.
“Well, we made nothing for the ﬁrst ﬁve days,”
answered Derrick drily—“ nothing at all.—How far have
we got to go to reach the Measured Mile by this road P ”
The two men had left the village, and were pursuing a
winding chalk-road that led, but not directly, to the
Downlands at the back of Mr. Chifney’s stables.
“ It is a very circuitous route," returned Master Walter
frankly; “and I was in hopes it might be shortened to
the fancy by hearing you tell something of your own
story. But, of course, I have no wish to press you to tell
it against your will. You have conferred obligations upon
me enough already, I am quite aware."
This was the ﬁrst sentence of conciliation, not to say
of civility, that the young man had spoken, and hereto-
fore his air had been cross or cynical; yet no sooner did
he evince this little of good-will, than the manner of the
other softened at once to a degree that was very remark-
able in so rough a man.
“ Don’t talk of obligations, lad, for I like you—ay, so
well, that I wish you were son of mine; not that I am
fit to be the father of such as you either; I know that
well.”
“If I were your son, I am afraid you would have a

good deal of trouble with me, Mr. Derrick,” replied the
young man laughing: “ I am not a good boy."
“ That is true, Walter Lisgard ; and yet I never saw a
face that took my liking as yours does—save once. I
could not tell what drew me so towards you, when I ﬁrst
met you up at the Farm yonder; but now I know very
well."
“Then it is to the similarity between myself and some
other favoured individual that I am indebted for your
regard? That rather robs the compliment of its ﬂavour.”
“Ay, my lad; but you are dear to me for your own
sake also, although, indeed, I scarce know why."
“Thank you, Mr. Derrick."
“ True,” continued the other thoughtfully, without
noticing his companion's ﬁippant tone, “ on are like—
ah, Heaven, how like you are to one tiat’s dead and
gone! Indeed, I can refuse you nothing while I think
upon it. It is not everybody, however, lad, whom I
would humour by telling exactly what I am worth. While
a man is merely known as rich, he may have any sum,
and be looked up to accordingly; but when his wealth
can be reckoned to a pound, he loses credit. If Many-
law: wins at Epsom, I shall be worth—ay, near a
hundred thousand pounds.” '
“ I suppose no one in Cariboo ever made a sum like
that by gold-digging, eh P ”
“ I think no one, Master Walter. There was no claim
so rich as my mate's and mine at Snowy Creek, and it
did not yield that sum. But, by Heaven, how well I re-
member what it did yield. It seemed to me then that I
should never run risks any more, but live on what I
had in content and plenty ,' and yet here I am, this very
mornin ”
“My dear Sir,” interrupted his companion gaily, “it
appears to me that you are taking gloomy views. What
is life without excitement? ”
“Ay, that is very well for you, lad, who have something
to fall back upon, if your little schemes should miscarry.

Excitement in your case is only another.name for amuse-
ment; but in mine ”
“ Well, in yours, Mr. Derrick?”
“ Do not call me Mister ,- call me Ralph, lad—that is,
if you are not ashamed of me altogether. —'You are
ashamed, I see. Well, never mind—Let me see, I was
speaking of Cariboo, was I not? Well, success or failure
there was a question of life and death. One might be a
beggar, or one might be the king of the colony. I had
known what poverty was—and that is not merely being
without money, mind ; I have lived among a savage people
for months who had neither gold nor silver—nothing to
hoard and nothing to spend save shells picked up on the
sea-shore, and strung 0n sea-weed for a purse; and I was
as poor as they; but yet it was not poverty. But I had
felt the sting of that in many a crowded city, and I came
to Cariboo to escape from it. If I should make my
thousand pounds or so, I would buy a farm, or a share in
a ship, and live a quiet respectable life to the end of my
days. While making these good resolutions, my ready
money—which was also all I had in the world—was
melting fast. With the last ten pounds of it, I bought
the half of a small claim at Snowy Creek. Blanquette
and I sawed our own lumber and made our own sluices.
It was no light work even for me, who had been used to
rough it. There was twelve feet of top-stripping to be
removed before we could hope to reach the pay-dirt. For
the ﬁrst ﬁve days, we made nothing. I would have sold
my share in the whole concern for a couple of pounds,
and begun life with that afresh; but on the sixth day we
found fourteen ounces of gold, and I was worth ﬁfty
pounds. Then I would not have sold my chance for
scarcely any sum that you could name. I would have
shot any man that had jumped into our pit, spade in
hand, just as I would have shot a dog. Your brother,
Sir Richard, may talk about the rights of property, but he
never appreciated them as I did then. On the seventh
day, we found forty-ﬁve ounces; on the eighth, Slxty.

The ﬁnd kept on increasing, till it rose to four hundred
ounces daily, when we employed eight hands to clear
away the tailings. The whole area of the place out of
which I scooped my fortune was not eighty feet by
twenty. I found for my share twelve thousand pounds
in it."
“And you brought that safe to England, did you ? ”
“ N o, lad, I did not. I spent ﬁve hundred pounds of
it in champagne—we drank it out of buckets—for one
item.”
“And in candles, Ralph," asked Master Walter smil-
ing—“ how much in candles? "
“In one thing and another, dear lad, I spent four
thousand pounds before we landed in England. Even
what was left would have seemed aﬁluence six months
before But there, what’s the good of talking? There’s
the rubbing-down house, is it not? and I shall soon know
whether I am going to get a second fortune, or to lose
what I have."

CHAPTER XII.
THE TRIAL.
:“l HE sun had risen, and the long waste of down
stretched far and wide on all sides; a broad
‘ and level track as smooth as any lawn, with
here and there a long but gentle slope, marked
the exercising-ground used by Mr. Chifney’s horses. This
glistened in the early rays like a path of silver. But
fringing it on one side lay a great patch of gorse, and
this quite twinkled with green and gold from the gos-
samers, whose slender ﬁbres covered it as with a veil.
The air was fresh and odorous with a hundred pleasant
scents and in the distant vale the morning mists were
lifting from ﬁeld and farm, from tower and town, as at the
command of some enchanter. Nothing was heard but
the occasional “ tink, tink ” of a sheep~bell from the still
sleeping folds. It was a scene to chami eye and ear;
but Captain Walter Lisgard of the 104th Dragoons, and
Mr. Derrick from Cariboo, were_persons upon whom the
dawn and its concomitants were a good deal thrown
away.
“You are sure this is the right place?" inquired the
colonist as they reached a long low-shuttered building,
half brick half wood, where the horses were wont to be
rubbed down after their gallops.
“ Ay, this is it right enough,” was the reply. “ I dare

say they are all 1nside there waiting for us. It does not
do to be seen at this sort of work. Yes, here they are.”
Inside the doorway of the shed in question stood Mr.
T ite Chifney, in company with a gentleman of advanced
years, in a white greatcoat and a new broad-brimmed hat,
somewhat resembling a bishop’s.
“ How are you, Lisgard P ”
“How do you do, my lord?” were the only salutations
that passed between the members of the two parties, who
had met entirely upon business. -
“ Come and beat the furze with me, will you, Derrick P
the captain has not his gaiters on. It is well to make
quite sure that we are all alone before we begin,” said
the horse-trainer. The two men accordingly stepped into
the gorse, and commenced walking through it in parallel
lines, as though in pursuit of game. When he came to a
patch of gorse a little higher and thicker than the rest,
Mr. Chifney struck it violently with his foot as if for
rabbits. All of a sudden, there was a violent ejaculation
from Derrick; he threw himself down upon some crouch-
ing object, and then came a struggle and a choking
scream. “ Hollo, don’t kill the fellow,” exclaimed
Chifney running up. “See, he’s black in the face, man.
Master Walter, my lord—help, here, help l"
The two men who had been left in the rubbing-house
came quickly forward, but it took the combined strength
of all three of them to release the poor wretch from the
powerful grasp of the Cariboo miner.
“ Damn the rogue ; I’ll teach him to come spying
here,” cried he, nodding with his head towards a shattered
telescope, upon which he had just stamped his foot. “I’ll
squeeze his throat for him.”
“You seem to have done that already, Sir,” said the
man in the broad-brim coolly; “ a very little more of it,,
and you would probably have had your throat squeezed
for you by the hangman. Poor devil, he doesn’t seem to
have much beside his life belonging to him, so that it
would be hard to take that.”

A wretched object, clothed in ragged black, and with
wisps of straw for shoes, wet- with the dew amid which he
had been lying, and shivering with pain and fear, here
crawled to the last speaker’s feet.
“ Don’t let ’em murder me, my lord. They will, if you
don’t interfere," screamed the wretched “tout,” whose
mission it was to procure racing intelligence under difﬁ-
culties of this sort, but who had been fairly cowed by
Dcrrick’s rage and violence. “ I swear to you that I will
never tell a soul that I have seen your lordship ”
“ Quiet, fool I ” interrupted the other sternly, “unless
you want to have your lying tongue cut 0ut.——It’s bad
enough," whispered he to the trainer, “that he should
have seen we here, but do you think he has seen the
horses ? ”
“That’s quite certain, my lord," returned the trainer
coolly ; “and this is a mouth as can’t be shut about that
matter. But he shall see nothing more of this morning’s
work—Come here, you Sir.”
Taking the trembling wretch by the collar, he led him
to the edge of the furze, and, having securely tied his
arms and legs, enveloped his head in a horse-cloth which 4
he brought out of the rubbing-house. From the same
building there now emerged two horses, not in the
clothes in which exercise was generally taken, but ready
in all respects for racing, and ridden not by stable-boys
as usual, but by regular jockeys.
“ There is no question about it but the bay is the best-
looking, my lord,” said the trainer, in answer to some-
thing that had been addressed to him ; “but handsome
is as handsome does. You would not thank me for
praising The King on Epsom Downs, after he had been
beaten by an outsider such as yonder horse.”
“Who rides the creature?” inquired the other sharply,
and looking contemptuously towards the clumsy black,
who was no other than our old friend Mandala.
“Dam'me if he don’t look more ﬁt for a hearse than a
race-course.”

“Jack Withers, my lord—a man that was with him in
France, and thoroughly understands what the horse can
do 3 and, indeed, there is no other that can ride him as
should be. That’s the worst of these foreign horses—
they are so full of tricks. I‘ve known that black stand
stock-still in his gallops, and shoot his boy off just like a
rocket. He can’t abide a strange seat."
“Of course Withers rides him in the great race,” ob-
served the other thoughtfully.
“Certainly, my lord, just as Tom Uxbridge here will
mount 27:: King. What’s the good of having a trial-race
unless with the same jocks as is to ride them afterwards P
Starting from that white post, up the rise yonder, round
the ﬁr clump, and so back again, is the Derby course to
a. yard. Master Walter and Mr. Derrick, will you be so
good as to bear a hand, and help me out with the
steps P ”
“Aint the gentleman in the broad-brim going to use
them as well as me?” observed the colonist insolently,
and keeping his hands resolutely in his pockets. “I
never engaged myself to be his body servant, as I know
on.”
There being no answer to this appeal, Captain Lisgard
and the trainer once more entered the rubbing-house, and
reappeared dragging with them a movable platform upon
wheels, and furnished with a ﬂight of steps after the
manner of a pulpit. From the top of this, one might
see the whole course from end to end, and upon it the
four spectators took their station close to the starting-
post.
“Now, my lads, are you both ready?” inquired the
trainer of the jockeys, who were getting their fuming
horses into line. “This handkerchief will serve for a
ﬂag, and when I drop it, let there be no false starts.
One, two, three—now OFF !”
As the handkerchief left his ﬁngers, the bay and black
leaped forward as with a single impulse ,- the next moment
each had got into his stride, and was away like the wind.

“It is amazing how they keep together,” muttered his
lordship in an uneasy tone; “ I should not have thought
the Frenchman had had such speed in him.”
“ It is the hill which will decide the matter, my lord,"
returned the trainer in a low tone ; “the ground is rising
already. There, and see, the black draws ahead.”
“ Ay, the black has it!” cried Derrick with a frightful
imprecation. “I will lay ﬁfty pounds to ten on Many-
laws."
“ I take you, Sir," said the man in the broad-brim,
coolly, as with race-glass in hand he watched every move-
ment of the horses who were now nearing the ﬁr-clump;
“there has something happened to that big-boned animal
of yours, I fear. What is it, Chifney P ”
He was about to pass the glass to the trainer, but
Derrick roughly tore it from his grasp, and applied it to
his own eyes. “ It‘s one of his infernal jibs,” exclaimed
he ; and yet Well done, Jack Withers; that’s a ﬁve-
pound note in your pocket. Perhaps you’d like to look
again, my lord, for their position is a little altered.”
“ The black is gaining fast,” ejaculated Captain Lisgard,
his pale face aglow with excitement. “ He has recovered
all he lost by that false step. What a pace they are
coming down the hill! By Heaven, The King is beaten !
Tom is using the whip.”
“ Just what I expected,” murmured the trainer.
There was a thunder of hoofs, the smack of a whip
again and again, a ﬂash of colour—ﬁrst black, then bay—
and the trial-race was over.
“In a second and a half less time than the last
Derby," said his lordship drily, after consulting his stop-
watch.
“ I think I did not bring you here for nothing, my
lord,” said the trainer conﬁdentially.
“Certainly not, Mr. Chifney,” returned the other
bitterly ; “ I ﬁnd myself a poorer man than I had thought
to be three minutes ago by ﬁfty thousand pounds. More-
over, I have made the acquaintance of one of the greatest

ruﬁians that I have ever met even upon a race-course. It
is altogether an excellent morning’s work.”
“ It would have been worse for you, my lord, if you had
not come,” answered the trainer with some stiffness ;
“ you would not have thanked me if you had seen this
for the ﬁrst time on Epsom Downs.”
“Very true—very true, Mr. Chifney. But you must
excuse my feeling a little annoyed by the results of this
gallop. And as for this gentleman with the beard—when
he has done shaking his hands with his jockey Here
are two ﬁve-pound notes for you, Sir—the amount of my
bet.”
“ Keep it yourself, my lord," exclaimed Derrick, waving
his hat round and round in frantic joy. ‘ Or stay, if you’re
too proud. Here, Jack, is a ﬁver for you ; and here, you
poor devil in the horse-cloth, here’s another for you, to
heal your windpipe, which, I believe, I squeezed a little
too hard a while ago. If the race had gone agen me,
you’d never have got a shilling of compensation, so you
may thank Maryland."
The trainer’s hand was clapped upon the incautious
gold-digger’s mouth with considerable emphasis, but it
arrived too late. “The cat was out of the bag.” The
tout had learned the very piece of intelligence to obtain
which he had gone through so much.
Bound and bruised, and in evil plight as he was, the
fellow could not help indulging in a sly chuckle, while
his four enemies (for the jockeys were already in the
rubbing-down house attending to their panting steeds) re-
garded one another with looks of blank dismay.
“You have done it now, Mr. Derrick,” observed the
trainer lugubriously. “We shall never get thirty to one
---no, nor ten to one—against Melzdaus again. Great
Heaven ! why, you wouldn’t kill the man ! ”
The gold digger had drawn a clasp knife, half dagger,
half cutting-tool, from his pocket, and was quietly feeling
the point of it with his thumb. “I have done wrong,”
said he, “but it is a wrong which is not without remedy.

No, I am not going to murder this gentleman—at least
not now ; but I have something of importance to tell him.
Look you here, Mr. Tout. I am not a respectable person
any more than yourself, in a general way; but there is
probably this difference between us—I am a man of my
word. What I my I will do, I always do do, at all
hazards. If a. man robs another of his gold in the place
where I come from, we shoot him; it mayn’t be right,
but that is the principle on which we act. You will rob
me of all I have in the world if you tell what you have
seen to-day ; consequently, mark me, if you do tell,
I will kill you. Of this you may be well assured.
That is the only satisfaction which will be left me. You
have felt my ﬁngers, but you will in that case feel this
knife. I hope I make myself well understood No,
Master Walter, this is not your business, but a private
matter between this person and myself. I want to take a
good look at him, so that I may know him again any-
where ; alone or in company, in England or across seas ;
let him be sure I shall ﬁnd him out; and I want him to
take a good look at me. Mine is not the face of a man
who falters in his purpose, or who, having suffered a
wrong, puts up with it, I think, and does not revenge
himself." '
He knelt down, and set his bearded cheek quite close
to the luckless tout. Each looked into the otlrer’s eyes
—one inquiringly, wrtha halfstirnid, half’cunning glance ;
the other sternly, vengefully, like a. judge and execu-
tioner in one.
“ I will never tell !" quavered the miserable wretch-
“s’help me Heaven, I never will l "
“Yes, you will,” returned Derrick coolly; “I can see
that you are a babbler born; and I don’t ask impossi-
bilities. Moreover, it is but just that you should derive
some advantage from my folly. In a week's time, you
may tell your employer what you please. In the mean-
while, there is your ﬁve pounds. I wish to act as fairly
by you as I can; but if the odds rise or fall respecting

these two horses within seven days—as they can only do
if the result of this trial gets wind—then I shall know
where to ﬁnd a sheath for this knife.” With these words
he cut the rope that bound the man’s arms and legs,
pushed the ﬁve-pound note into his hands, and bade
him be off : whereupon off he shambled.
Neither the trainer nor the man addressed as “my
lord ” had stirred or spoken aword during this interview,
and Captain Lisgard had only once made a movement as
though to interrupt it. All three were well enough pleased
that the gold-digger had taken the task of imposing
silence into his own hands. In all likelihood, he was
merely threatening the fellow; and if not, they did not
wish to be accessories before the fact to—to any
vengeance he might choose to inflict upon the offending
tout.
“ Well, gentlemen, we have now six clear days where-
in to make our arrangements," said Derrick, “and a
good deal may be done in that time. True, but for
my stupid conduct, we might have had more time be-
fore us ; but I have made what amends lies in my
power.”
“You believe, then, that yonder rascal will keep his
word, do you P ” inquired the trainer incredulously.
“I think so, Mr. Chifney. I shall certainly keep
mine,” returned the other gravely. “ Master Walter, we
had better be moving home."
At these words, the party separated—like men who
have each their work to do, and are glad to be quit
of their companions, in order that they may set about
it—with no more ceremony than a parting nod. The
man in the broad-brim rode away upon a shooting-pony
which awaited him in the rubbing-down house. The
jockeys paced slowly towards their stables, each horse
now clothed and visored as though it had been merely
out for early exercise; while Mr. Chifney walked briskly
homeward by another route.
Derrick and Captain Lisgard returned together by the

way they came, and plodded on for some time in total
silence.
“ You will put all your money upon the black un now,
I fancy, Master Walter?” observed the gold-digger at
last, as they drew near the village.
“I have done that already,” replied the young man
frankly. “I was thinking rather of hedging when the
odds fall.”
“Nay, do not do that, lad," rejoined the other
earnestly; the thing is a. certainty. The King was the
only horse that we had to fear. On the contrary, my
advice is, ‘ Put the Pot on."’
“The Pot is on, with all I have to put in it, Mr.
Derrick. You forget that I am not an eldest son, and
nobody lends money to a younger."
“Ay, true : there's that confounded stuck-up coxcomb,
Sir Richard. But look here, my lad. In this pocket-
book I carry all I am worth in the world, for in Cariboo
there are no banks, and a man at my time of life does not
readily change his habits. Here are ﬁve hundred pounds
entirely at your service. Nay, I told you that I had
taken a liking to you, and I would give them to you right .
away, only I suppose you are too proud to accept them,
save as a loan."
“ Mr. Derrick—Ralph—you are very, very kind,” said
the young man hesitatingly ; “but this is a large sum.”
“ At the present prices, it is ten thousand pounds if
Many/mus wins,” replied the gold-digger, rubbing his
hands; “and if ﬁlarzylaw: does not win—well, I shall
not, I hope, be an importunate creditor. I do not say,
‘ Do not thank me,’ lad, for I like you to smile like that.
You are very, very welcome. But here we part ; you to
your home and friends, and I—well, I am used to be_
alone. I shall not see a. friend's face again till I see
yours. Good-bye, dear lad, good-bye.”
With a hearty hand-shake and more thanks, Master
Walter strode gaily away through the still slumbering
village, reclimbed the avenue gate, and let himself norse-

lesst in at the front door. As he passed on tiptoe along
a gallery, on the one side of which lay his sister’s apart-
ment, and on the other that of Miss Rose Aynton’s, a
door opened, and an anxious voice whispered, “What
news, Walter? ” “Good news,” replied he in the same
cautious tone, and glided on to his own room.

CHAPTER XIII.
AT SIR ROBERT'S GRAVE.
my lady had not left the Abbey grounds for
these many weeks; but there had been one
exception to that course of conduct. She had
never omitted to visit, as usual, her late husband's grave,
and to lay upon it a posy of spring ﬂowers, gathered by
her own hands; but she did this now in the evening,
instead of the daytime, as heretofore. It was not, how-
ever, likely that any intruder should be found there at
any hour. Whoever of the household saw her walking in
the direction of the little church—only a stone's-throw
from the servants’ oﬁices—took great care to avoid her,
or to appear, if they needs must meet her, unconscious of
her errand; and while she was there, no domestic used
the little zigzag path among the grass-grown graves that
formed the short cut to the village. The country folk
were forbidden at all times to approach the Abbey by
that way, so the sacred spot was almost as private as
though it had been an appendage of the Abbey itself,
as it had been in the old times. Mirk lay quite out
of the high-road, so that no stranger “stretching his
legs," while the coach changed horses, ever strolled
into its God’s-acre to spend a proﬁtless ﬁve minutes
amid its solemn records; nor, indeed, was there any-
thing in the grave-ground, whatever might have been

in the church to attract such persons, in the way of
monument or efﬁgy. Yet the humble graves were all
well kept ; not broken or dinted in, as one too often sees
them in such places; nor did the head-stones lean this
way and that, as though they strove to wrench up the
very mounds they were set to mark ; nor were the
long rank grasses and the nettles permitted to over-
grow the spot, and hide it from the sun. Upon every
slab, however, save one, time was doing its work, cover-
ing with moss and lichen the grey surface, and ﬁlling up
the letters on the stones—just as in the hearts of the
survivors it was healing the sense of loss, and effacing
the memory of the departed one. The sole exception
was the stone which commemorated Sir Robert’s death.
His marble cross was without speck or ﬂaw. It stood in
the western corner, in a little plot of garden-ground of its
own, and beside it was a vacant space, left there by his
widow’s desire, that she might herself be laid there when
God’s good time should come.
It is the evening of the day upon which Master Walter
. got up so early, and my lady has come, as usual, to her
husband’s tomb. Her hand is resting on the top of it,
whereon she has just hung a chaplet 0f fresh-gathered
ﬂowers ,' but her look is ﬁxed upon the western sky, where
the glory of the sunken sun yet lingers. It may be but a
simple faith that associates heaven with the sky, but it is
a very natural one. My lady's soul was longing to be at
rest somewhere beyond those quiet clouds which ﬂecked
that golden deep. Death is not so invariably hateful to
us as the divines would paint it ; it has no terrors for the
good—nay, sometimes not for the bad either—while to
the wretched it would often be more welcome than the
dawn.
“ If I could only ‘fall asleep,’ as is said of the
saints," thought my lady, “here, and at this instant,
how well for all would it be ! Some only live for others,
they say, but the best that could possibly happen to all I
love would be that I should be laid in my grave. And

some have died for others, as God knows I would die for
any one of my dear ones, and yet it would be sin in me
to die. Ah, husband, husband ! thou that liest here
under the flowers and the sky, I would to Heaven that I
could lie down beside thee now, and never wake! I
trust thou dost not know this thing that troubles me, and
threatens mine and thine, or thy dear heart would be
wrung with pity, although thou wert an angel and in
eternal bliss. And but that the Almighty has ﬁxed his
canon against self-slaughter—— Those were happy days
in which I ﬁrst read that! ” mused she, interrupting her-
self, and carried involuntarily into another current of
thought; “ we read it together, you and I, Robert. My
new life was just beginning then ; never had pupil such
a kindly teacher as thou wert. I can bear to think of
that; but of thy love, thy noble generous love, thy patient
tenderness— Spare me, great Heaven 3 I did so
worship this dead man, and now I live alone ; and yet I
would not have him here alive, to know what I know, to
feel what I feel, to dread what I dread—no, not though
we should be permitted to live together for years, and die
within the self-same hour, as I used to pray we might. I
thank thee, merciful God, that I am bearing this heavy
cross alone ; give me strength to carry it, and suffer me
to do so—if it please thee—to the end, alone. It is my
fault, husband; all mine. When you pressed me to
marry you, and I said ‘ No,’ I should have said it more
ﬁrmly. We were not ﬁt for one another.—No, no 3 not
that! I will not say that. You made me what I am;
a wife ﬁt for yourself, I do believe ; not good, like you—
not wise, like you—but one who was a faithful and true
helpmate, and with whom you were content. If you
could make a sign to me from the earth, or in the air, this
moment, I should not be afraid but that it would be one
of love. If you, perchance, have come to know every
thought in my heart that was in your time—or if you have
read it since you died—or if you read it now— still I_ should
not be afraid ! I will endeavour to do my duty still 3 but

ah ! how foolish are they who say we always know what
is our duty! Oh Robert, what is mine?”
She wrung her hands in pitiful distraction, and throw-
ing herself down by the graveside, whispered, as though
to the deaf ear beneath: “The sea has given up its dead
to shame me, and thy children, because of me. What is
there for me to do for them except to die ? ”
“Hollo, missus! what’s wrong wi’ you?” inquired a
deep hoarse voice. “Drunk or sober, I never could
abide seeing a woman cry.”
At such a time and place, the sudden and unexpected
interruption might well have sent a shudder to any
woman’s heart, and it was no wonder that my lady
trembled in every limb. But she gathered herself
together with a great effort, and drawing her thick crape
veil over her face, arose, and steadily confronted the
intruder.
“Why, it’s my lady herself!” cried the new-comer,
derisively—“the party as I’ve promised myself a good
look at before I left these diggings. And, dam’me, but
now I’ll have it. If I’m anyways rude, you. will please to
put it down to the brandy in which I have been drinking
to the very good health of the big black horse. Now,
don’t be so cursedly proud; your son and I—not Sir
Richard, for he’s a—— Well, you’re his mother, so I
won’t say what I was agoing to about him ,- but Master
Walter, he and I are great friends—Now, why do you

borrow money of your humble servant; but there-—
there’s no obligation in that, for 1 love the lad. He’s like—
like a dear friend of mine, who was drowned in the sea,
years and years ago. Lord, how you do tremble ! Why, I'm
the last man in the world to hurt a woman, bless you.
My nature is altogether soft where they’re concerned ; and
if it were not so, there was a woman once, my lady,
drowned and dead—the same as I was speaking 0f-f0r
whose sake every woman smce has been in my eyes sort
of sacred-like ; that is, unless I was in drink.”

It was painfully evident to my lady that the person who
was speaking to her was in the unhappy condition he had
just referred to, for he lurched from side to side until he
had bethoughthim of steadying himself by the marble
cross; but there was a sort of pathos in his voice, too,
which was not the mere maudlin tenderness of the
drunkard. If he had not been drunk, he might not have
been tender, but there was evidently genuine feeling in the
man, which seemed to deepen as he went on. “Now,
though you do not speak, I know you’re sorry for me. If
I should lift your veil—there, I’m not agoing to do it—
I am sure you would have a tear for a poor fellow who
has been knocked about the world for three parts of his
life, and has not made a single friend—not one, not one ;
and if he went back home, who would not see a face he
knew—it is so long ago that he was there—and who
needs a woman’s voice to comfort him if ever a man
did.”
“What’s all this to me, Sir P ” asked my lady in low and
broken tones. “I wish to be left alone here—by this
ave.”
“What—is—all—this—to you 7” returned the man
with vindictive deliberation. “ Have you no heart, then,
you proud woman, like your eldest son?” Then once
more altering his manner, he continued : “ N ow, do not
be angry with me, or you may be sorry for it, but rather
pity me. This grave contains what is dear to you, it
seems ; but you have those alive who love you also ! Now,
I have not even a grave. The only creature on earth
who ever loved Inc—and I loved her too, ah how dearly,
though I could not keep even then from drink—she lies
buried beneath the stormy waves. I cannot come, as
you can, to this tomb, and say: ‘Here she sleeps,’ and
weep over it, and be sorry for my sins, for I know not
where, in all the waste of ocean, her bones may lie. So,
for many years I never looked upon the sea without the
sense that I was looking upon one great grave. Am I
speaking truth or not P "

He stopped and clutched her by the arm, and ﬁercely
bade her tell him if she believed his words or no.
“I do believe you, Sir," returned my lady, ﬁrmly.
“Beneath your bronzed and bearded face, I see your
woes at work, and I am sorry for you." -
“Thank you, lady,- you have a pleasant and kind
voice, with music in it such as I have not heard for many
a day. You are sorry for me, but you know not half my
woes 3 I have never told them to any human ear ; although
at times, when I have been all alone—upon the treeless
prairie, not knowing whether I was on the right track or
lost, or on the mountain-top in strange and savage lands,
and chieﬂy when a solitary man on shipboard, keeping
watch while others slept—then have I spoken of these
things aloud, and asked of Heaven why it used me so.
But now—as some black cloud will overpass a mighty
plain, and never shed a drop, but presently, on coming
on a little valley fenced with round green hills, will
straight dissolve in rain, so I, who have been so silent for
so long, am moved to speak by you. What magic is
this you hear about you, woman? Let me see your
face."
“There is no need for that Sir," answered my lady,
stepping back, and motioning with her arm with dignity.
“The magic of which you speak lies only in a. feeling
heart and an attentive ear. If it is any comfort to you to
tell your story, I will gladly listen to it.”
“Yes, it seems to be a comfort,” replied the other,
thoughtfully, “although I never cared to speak of it
before. You see me, lady, now, a brawling, drunken
wretch—upon whose reckless soul there may be murder,
to-morrow or next day, as like as not—but anyhow a.
broken man. I was not always thus. When I was
young, I was a hopeful and hard-working lad enough—
onlya little thoughtless. I was honest, too, notwith~
standing that the law and I fell out; but I was fond of
jovial company and good liquor, and what I got at sea-—

very quickly on shore. If I had had a wife, or even a
mother, I think it might have been different; but I had
no relations, or at least none who were my friends. I
could not bear advice, and much less interference and
dictation, and so, you see, I was alone in the world—
until I met with Lucy Meade-— You shiver, my lady.
Am I keeping you too long in the night-air? ”
Lady Lisgard shook her head, and murmured: “ No ;
go on.”
“'Tis thirty years ago this very year—that’s many
thousand days, and tens of thousand leagues have I
sailed since then—and yet, I swear, it seems but yesterday
I crossed those water-meadows with my gun—for I
was after moorfowl—and came upon her cottage on the
Blea. White-walled, white-roofed—for in those parts
they paint them so—it nestled under a rocky hill, crested
with heather; and in front the river ran, swollen with
recent rains, through a broad weedy ﬂat, and so, between
the rounded sand-hills, to the sea. Before the cottage
was a porch with honeysuckles trained upon it, and one
full-ﬂowering fuchsia upon either side. Then, as I drew
near, I saw her sitting in the porch mending her father's
net. Ah, Heaven, I see her now !"
The speaker paused and sighed; but looking out into
the viewless air, as if upon some picture hung in space,
he did not mark my lady start and clasp her hands, as
' though some dreadftl thing had come upon her suddenly,
against which none could help her but only God alone.
“ It is a story, Lady Lisgard, that you doubtless know,"
continued the man, “for even among lords and ladies
love will come. I asked her for a drink of water, and
she brought me with it Hope, Resolve, Repentance—I
know not what. From that moment forth, I lived my
life anew. Then the next day, and the next, I sought
the cottage; and when I had won my way with Lucy—
that was her name, my lady—did I tell you ?—I pleaded
my cause with the old ﬁsherman, her father—her mother
being already ours—but for a long time in vain.

“She was his only child, his only prop and stay, and
he was proud of her, as well he might have been, for
she was gentle of speech as you yourself or any lady
born, and scholarly and wise beyond her humble state,
and, young as she was, already had had many a suitor ; but
she had never loved but me. ’Tis like enough you can-
not fancy that 5 but then my former self was not like this."
He pointed to his heart with a scornful gesture, as
though something loathsome had taken the place of what
had wont to be there.
“Besides, the fairest, purest creature upon earth was
she, and she took all things for pure. Not that there was
much against me either, except that I loved good liquor ;
besides, I only drank for pleasure, then, and now
But let that be. Well, we were married. We lived with
the'old couple at the cottage, as Lucy wished, partly for
their sakes, partly, as I have often thought since then, for
mine—that I might be kept out of bad company, such as
there was plenty of at Bleamouth at that time—poachers,
smugglers, and idlers of all sorts. But this was done too
late. I have said that the law and I fell out: that was
for poaching—and curse the law, say I, which rich men
make for the poor perforce to break. I never poached
after I married, but before that time I had shot a hare or
two; and once—but months ago—there had been a fray
with keepers, and I had clubbed my gun, and struck my
hardest, like the rest. There had been broken bones on
both sides, but the matter had blown over, as I thought,
when all of a sudden I received certain news that I was
marked for one of the offenders, and that men were
coming to take me from my Lucy’s arms to jail. I told
her this, for I had kept nothing from her all along, and I
knew that she had courage, or she would never have
married such a man as me ; but I forgot, in my selﬁsh
roughness, that it is one thing to be brave in things that
concern one’s self, and another to be able to bear to see
others suffer. ‘Ah, Heaven!’ exclaimed she, ‘but this
will kill my father ! To have his honest house entered by

men in search of felons, and to see his daughter’s husband
with the gyves upon him—that will be his death, I know.’
The auld wife said so likewise.
“They were right, I think, for when we came to break
the thing to him, and warn him of what might happen,
although all was said to excuse what I had done, and to
soften the consequences that might come of it, he raved
like one distracted. ‘ Let him leave my cottage !’ cried he ;
‘he has worked mischief enough already; be has robbed
me of my daughter’s love, and now he would take from me
my good name. Let him leave this honest roof! ’ ‘ But
where he goes, I must go, father,’ replied Lucy, with her
arms about the old man’s neck; and in the end he was
brought to see that it must be so. So I changed my name
to that of Derrick, which I bear now, and ﬂed from home
to a great seaport, and there, on board an emigrant-ship
bound for the other side of the world, took passage not
only for myself and wife, but for her parents. It was
agreed that all were to begin life again in a strange land,
so that I, too, might begin it once more with that fair
start which I had lost in my own country. Thus the poor
old man and his wife were torn from the comfortable home
that had sheltered them for half a century, and forced in
their old age to cross the seas. N 0, not to cross them :
would to Heaven they might have been suffered so to do!
It was ordained that I, who had thus far caused their
wretchedness, should also be the means of their death.
A most terrible storm overtook us at midnight, while yet
in sight of lights on English land, and in the midst of it
our vessel sprung a leak. I knew that I had a brave
woman for my wife, but then I found she was a heroine;
I knew my Lucy was good as she was fair, but then she
proved herself an angel. There were men on board who
screamed and wailed like children. She never uttered a
cry or shed a tear. She felt that she was going to heaven
with all she loved (for she always thought the best of
everyone), and therefore death had no terrors for her.
But I—I felt myself a murderer. I did what I could to

save the two old people, and got them into the only boat
that left the ship; but it had not parted from us twice its
length, before it capsized before our eyes.
Lucy had refused to leave me, and when the vessel
began to sink, I lashed her to a spar, and then myself;
and so for a little time we ﬂoated. But the great waves
drenched us through and through, and dashed upon us so
that we had hardly time to breathe. The spar was not large
enough for both our weights, which sank it too low in the
water ; and so I secretly unloosed the cords that fastened
me, and clambered to my Lucy’s side, and kissed her cold
wet cheek, and whispered : ‘Farewell, .Lucy.’ ”
Here the speaker paused, and covered his rough face.
My lady, too, was deeply moved. For near a minute,
neither spoke. Then the man resumed: “ I slipped into
the sea, and struck out aimlessly enough, but with the
instinct of a swimmer. Fool that I was to wish to live ! "
Again he paused; but this time, to mutter an execration.
“ And did not all your care and unselﬁsh love sufﬁce
to save her P ” asked the listener, tenderly.
“ N o, lady. She was drowned. I never expected
otherwise in such a sea. The whole ship’s company
were lost, except myself. When nearly spent, I came
upon a huge piece of the wreck, and held on to it till
daylight, when I found myself at sea. I would to God
that it had not been so! I was nearer heaven at that
time than I have ever been since, and I ought to have
perished then, when all which made life precious had
already gone : it would have been far better to have died
with her, than to live without her. But I did live. After
two days and three nights of hunger and thirst, a vessel
picked me up, a sodden mass of rags, half-dead and half-
mad. They nursed me and made me well—it was a cruel
kindness—and after many days, I was able to tell them
what had happened. ‘ Ay, then,’ said they, ‘the pilot
was right who came . to us of? Falmouth. It was the
1V0; 1/: Star that went to pieces in the storm ; you are the
sole survivor, man, of all on board. Nothing came on

shore that night, or could have come on such a coast as
that, save spars and corpses.’ ”
There was silence for a minute’s space: the strong
man's chest laboured in vain to give him breath for
utterance; in vain his horny hand dashed the big tears
from his brown cheeks; they still rained on. “Alas,
poor man I" said my lady, in a broken and pitiful voice, '
“ I feel for you from my very soul. And when you found
your three-weeks’ bride was dead—I think you said you
had married her but three weeks—what then became of
you i’"
“What matters?” asked the man half angrily. “It
mattered nothing even to myself. The vessel took me—
it was all one to me whither she was bound—to New
SouthWales. And in the New World I did indeed begin a
new life—but it was a far worse one than in the old. I
was reckless, hopeless already, and I was not long in
becoming godless. When that is said, a man’s history
is the same, wherever he lives, whatever he does, and
however he ends.”
He stamped his foot upon the ground, as though he
would keep down some rising demon, and his voice once
more resumed the hoarseness it had exchanged for some-
thing almost plaintive throughout his story.
“ Ralph, Ralph,” began my lady, reprovingly, and
touching his rough sailor’s sleeve with her gloved hand
“And how the devil should you know my name is
Ralph ?" interrupted the other in blank amazement.
“My maid, Mary Forest, told me it was Ralph,” re-
turned my lady, calmly.
“Did she? Well, that’s no reason why you should
call me by it. However, since you seem to feel so unex-
pected an interest in your humble servant, I will make
bold to ask a favour of you." His manner was rough
and deﬁant as ever now, like that of a sturdy vagrant
soliciting alms of a defenceless woman.
“ You are angry with yourself," said my lady, quietly,
“for having given way to feelings which do you honour ;

that is a base sort of regret indeed. You try to persuade
yourself that I have affected a sympathy which I did not
feel, but you do not succeed. I cannot but be interested
in one who, with all his faults, has certainly in the hour
of death and danger behaved nobly, and who must, I
feel assured, have the seeds of good in him yet, despite
his wild and despairing talk.”
“ No, woman, I have not," returned the man with
vehemence. “Dismiss that from your mind at once.
Ralph Derrick is no hypocrite, whatever he is, and he
tells you now that he is a lost man, in the sense which
such as you understand it. I don’t know why I have
spoken to you as I have done just now—some springs
of feeling that I had deemed were quite dried up ﬂowed at
your voice as they have not done these thirty years—but
don’t imagine that I am soft-hearted. I am not a bad
fellow when I’m sober, and not put out; but then I’m
seldom sober, and I’m very easily put out. Your son,
Sir Richard, has put me out, for,0ne. I should be sorry
for him if he and'I had much to do with one another.—
But there, you need not turn so pale ; for, for your sake—
and for Mr. Walter’s sake, who has got my Lucy’s eyes,
and look, and voice, God bless him—Sir Richard is safe
from me ; albeit I have let ﬂy a bullet before now at men
who have wronged me less than he has done—an insolent
young devil! It wasa man like him, one of your land-
owners, forsooth, whose persecution drove me from my
native shore, and drowned my wife and the old couple.
Damn all such tyrants, says Ralph Derrick ”
It was difficult to associate the depressed and solemn
speaker of a few minutes back with this passionate and
lawless man, his huge ﬁngers opening and shutting in
nervous excitement, his eyeballs suffused with blood, and
each hair of his vast beard, as it seemed, bristling with
vengeful fury.
“ You were saying that you wished to ask a favour of
me, Mr. Derrick P ” interposed my lady, quietly. “What
is it I Can do for you?”

“Well, you can do this,” returned he, roughly : “you
can cease to set your waiting-maid, Mary, against me, as
you have hitherto done. I am not a bad match for her,
as she knows, in point of money ; and if she ﬁnds herself
able to put up with little starts of temper, and not to
grudge me a drop 0’ drink at times, why, what is that to
you P "
“Have you told her, may I ask, of what you have been
telling me, Mr. Derrick? ”
“Yes ; at least I told her I was a widower; I never
felt aeall to tell her more ,- she would not understand,
look you. She asked me what this leaden locket was I
wear about my neck, with this poor broken piece of stick
in it, and something withered clinging to it still, and I
told her it was a charm against the ague. Now, you—I’ll
wager you can tell me what it holds.”
“ N 0, not I. How should] know ? ” inquired my lady,
hurriedly. ‘
“ You do know, anyway. This fellow is not the sort
of man to carry charms, you think ,' and all that’s sacred
to him in the world or out of it hangs on his love that’s
drowned. This, then, must be some token—were there
not fuchsias upon either side the porch where ﬁrst they
met? There, now, you have it, I can see."
“ You plucked, perhaps, a piece of fuchsia when you
plighted troth,” murmured my lady.
“ Ay, when we plighted troth,” answered the other,
mournfully ; “ and breaking a twig in twain, all blossom-
ing then, but now—see, dried to dust—each kept a half.
I have seen far up the hills in Mexico a piece of the true
Cross, that’s held to be the richest possession that the
Church calls her own in those parts ; well, that’s not sure;
it may be or it mayn‘t be what they term it ; but this poor
twig has never been out of my sight or reach, and so I
kiss and worship this, my relic, as no devotee can do.—
Now, what would Mary Forest say to that? She is not
like my Lucy ; no, indeed, no more than I am like the
Ralph of those old days; and if she were, should I be

ﬁt for her? My Lucy married to a drunken, gambling
ruﬁian! ’Tis blasphemy to think upon it. But as for this
wench, your waiting-maid, she and I are suited well
enough. She wants a husband, and is willing to take
me ; while I, who have been tossed so long on the stormy
billows of life, shall be glad to come to anchor. It is
you only—she told me so herself—who stand in the way."
“And would you have me, then, advise this woman—
being my faithful friend as well as my servant—to unite
her fortunes with a man who, from his own lips I learn,
is hopeless, reckless, Godless, a drunkard and a.
gambler "
“ Hell and F uries!” broke forth the other impatiently,
“ will you dare to use what I have just now told you against
myself 1 Beware, beware, proud woman, how you cross a
desperate man l Since my life is worthless, as you paint
it, you may be sure that I shall hold the risk of losing it
lighter than better men: there is nothing that I dare not
do to those who cross me.”
“ I have no fear for myself, Sir, and least of all things,
Ralph Derrick, do I fear death," answered my lady,
calmly. “Yet willingly I promise that I will never
breathe one syllable to human ear of what you have said
to-night.” ‘
“So far so well, my lady. When I found you here, I
was on my way to court your waiting-woman, but she
does not expect me. She has written me her answer
‘Yes’ or ‘No' before this, and I shall get it to-morrow
in London: it was agreed between us she should do so.
I was to have started to town this afternoon, but I over-
slept myself—not but that I got up early enough, as
Master Walter will witness—and missed the train from
Dalwynch. I am going thither to-night ; but, in the
meantime, I thought I could come back and take a fare-
well kiss from Mary, and her ‘Yes ' from her own lips.
I will receive no other answer, and if such should reach
me, I shall know from whom it comes. The matter is
in your hands, I know; come, let us part friends.”

“God forbid we should part enemies,” replied my
lady, fervently ; “ I will wrong you in nothing, but be as-

“ And be assured I shall have my way, Lady Lisgard,
at all risks," returned the other, grimly. “Are you too
proud to take my hand at parting P ”
For a. single instant, my lady hesitated; then reaching
out her ﬁngers, they met his own stretched out at fullest

CHAPTER XIV.
ONCE MORE IN MY LADY’S CHAMBER.
a, S my lady left the churchyard by the wicket-gate,
” she caught the ﬂutter of a female dress that
flitted on before her, and vanished in the
regions belonging to the domestics. Was it
possible that anybody had been a witness to her late in-
terview, or worse, a listener to the conversation? It was
in the highest degree improbable, but not impossible. By
crouching down behind the low stone wall, next Sir
Robert’s tomb, a person in the Abbey grounds, without
doubt, could have overheard, and even with caution,
might have watched them. It chilled my lady’s heart to
think of it. Yet what could be more unlikely? What
servant of hers would have ventured upon such an out-
rage? Could Mary Forest have so far forgotten herself,
actuated by an irrepressible curiosity to hear what her
mistress and her lover could have to say to one another
at that strange time and place? It was much more
probable that some domestic about to use the short-cut
through the churchyard, had seen her coming from it, and
hastened back, to avoid a meeting. At the same time,
the suspicion added to my lady’s troubles.
These were serious and pressing enough already,
Heaven help her! and yet, urgent and perilous as they
were, it was not of them that she ﬁrst thought when she

found herself once more in her own room. There are no
circumstances, however tremendous, which have power to
quench the susceptibilities of women : their feelings must
have way, no matter how dangerous the indulgence in
them, how immediate the necessity for action. The
meshes of a net which threatened destruction to herself
and all that were dear to her were cIOsing in around Lady
Lisgard, and, calm as she looked, she knew it well—well
as the wily salmon that poises motionless, and seemingly
unconscious of his peril, in the red pool, below which the
ﬁsherman has set the spreading snare ; but my lady turns
her back for a little upon the tide of woes that is setting
in upon her—a spring-tide that may reach Heaven knows
how far—and seeks the inland past. It is the last time
that she will ever visit it, and therefore she cannot choose
but linger there a while, and shed some bitter tears. Her
door is locked, for none must see her wishing “Good-
bye,” and the windows are wide open to the air, which
blows the ﬂame of her reading-lamp hither and thither.
She needs air, poor lady. A waft of wind that has swept
some snowy steppe would have been grateful to her
throbbing brow that April night ; as for light, a very
little is enough for her purpose. Those few old letters
she is reading, taken from a secret drawer in my lady’s
desk, are as familiar to her as her prayers, and she seems
to hold them almost as sacred. - Yet one is not even a
letter, but only a piece of folded notepaper, torn at the
creases, and yellow—nay, yellower than mere age could
possibly have turned it. It has been damaged by sea-
water. Within it are two locks of hair, quite white, and a
few words in faded ink, Frank Meade and Rae/1:1 Meade, '
with a date of ﬁve-and-thirty years ago.
She takes out the silver tresses, and looking on them
reverently for a few moments, kisses them, and puts them
back in the secret drawer—but not the writing ; that she
holds above the lamp until it has caught ﬁre, and watches
it until it is quite consumed, and the last spark has gone
out. Then she brings forth from the same hiding-place

two letters, evidently both by the same hand—a very un-
clerkly one—ill-spelled and ill-composed, but which have
been to her more dear than any written words for a.
quarter of a century ; for they were letters of a dead man,
the one when he was her accepted lover, the other after
he became her husband. They are letters of the dead
no longer; for he who was thought to have died is still
alive, and being so, has become an enemy more terrible
than any who should seek her life; one who, by simply
saying: “ This is my wife,” would thereby dishonour her,
disgrace her children, and even shame the memory of
that righteous man whose tomb she had just visited, and
wept over with such honest tears. And yet with tender-
ness, though mixed with a certain awe and shrinking,
does my lady look upon those time-worn words, notwith-
standing that the sacredness of death is no longer on
them. The ﬁrst is what is called a love-letter, anote
ﬁlled with foolish fondness, expressed with vehemence,
but without coarseness; the second a tissue of passionate
self-reproaches; the writer accusing himself of bringing a
curse upon her happy home in having married her ; then
stating, as though reluctantly, certain arrangements he
had made at the sea-port, from which his communication
was dated, for the passage of herself and parents by the
M1111 Star. Both are signed R1146]; Gaz'csz‘one.
“So loving and so penitent,” murmurs she. “Time
cannot surely have worked so ill with such a nature as he
would have me believel When he ﬁrst sang that carol
to my ear, I thought it might have been an angel singing :
O’er the hill and o’er the vale
Come three kings together.
Alas, alas! to think with what terror I heard him sing it
the last time. He may not be more changed within,
perhaps, than he is without; since, notwithstanding what
he said about his looks, I knew him again the ﬁrst
moment my eye lit upon him on yonder lawn. I wonder
whether he would have known me, supposing he had

snatched away my veil. Merciful Heaven, what a risk
was that! nay, is not every moment that he remains at
Mirk a risk? What if he heard the name of Gavestone
coupled with mine P I am sure he recognised something
in my voice, although I disguised it all I could. He must
never come back hither—never, never! He must be as
dead to me now as I deemed him to be before. God
knows I pity him from the bottom of my heart: and
also ”—here she paused—“ yes, and also that I do not
love him—no, not him, although I love the man that
wrote these words. I never concealed it, no, never, from
my—Sir Robert himself. I said : ‘ I have no love to give
you,’ all along; ‘ only respect, devotion, duty.’ And
those, Heaven knows, I gave. If all together, and a.
hundred other gracious feelings added, could have made
up love, then Sir Robert would have had that ; but they
can not. He knew it, noble heart, and was content. He
knew that in that drawer I kept these very things that
came on shore with me when Oh, Ralph, Ralph,
Ralph I" My lady shook with sobs 3 and 'then, in her
agony, mistaking the noise of her own passion for some
interruption from without, started up from the desk on
which she had thrown herself, and listened.
Nothing was to be heard save a faint peal of laughter
from the croquet-ground, where Walter and the two young
ladies were endeavouring to play by lantern-light—a frolic
she had heard them planning at dinner-time. Yet even
that slight tidings from the world without recalled her to
the present. “I must burn all proofs," she murmured,
as though repeating some authoritative command of
another rather than any determination of her own. Then
with a steady hand she took the letters, and burned them
to the last atom, reading the words with greediness, as
though, as the ﬂame consumed them one by one, the
remainder had grown more precious, like the Sibyl’s
books. There was more to try her yet. The last thing
which the little drawer contained had yet to be brought
forth—a leaden locket, the facsimile of the one which

Derrick had just shown to her in the churchyard. Within,
although almost, as he had expressed it, “ dried to dust,”
was a tiny sprig of wood. She emptied this into the hollow
of her hand, and instantly the wind whirled all away. My
lady uttered a 10w moan of anguish, then sat with the poor
token in her hand, which, worthless and vacant as it was,
yet, to her streaming eyes, held all the treasure of her
youth. “Alas, alas, for the time that is no more !” cried
she. “Who could have thought that I, with my own
hand, should destroy this precious pledge P Kind
Heaven, direct me—teach me what it is right to do !
Till death should part us did I swear to cherish him ; and
now, though we both live, alone he roves the world. It may
be I should win him back to his former self, and save a
soul alive. He has loved me always—always; and he
loves me now, although he deems I have lain beneath the
waves these thirty years, and although he seeks But
that shall never be. I will tell Mary Forest rather to her
face: ‘I myself am married to this man whom you would
wed.’ He shall not bring another sin upon himself and
shame on her, and Ah, Heaven help me ; what is
that which I should do in this sad strait? ”
It was terrible to see my lady’s look of woe, as rising
from her chair, she paced the room, and now prayed
Heaven for aid, and now stood listening to the mirth that
still broke in from out of doors by ﬁts, and now gazed
fixedly upon the little leaden case within her hand, as
though there were some magic help in ﬁnd. “Farewell,
Lucy,” murmured she ; “ the last words that I ever
thought to hear him say, which, having said, he dropped,
to save my life, into the wave. And now I see him storm-
tossed in the sea of sin, certain to sink, without a plank
but this poor ancient love of his to which to cling, and
yet I may not stretch a ﬁnger forth to aid him. Ah me,
what base return ! Why did I not cleave to him, although
I thought him dead, as he to me? Why was I not faith-
ful to his memory, as he to mine? Why say : ‘ In three
years’ time, Sir Robert, if your fancy still holds ﬁrm, I

will be yours?’ Why not repeat that ‘ No ’ I gave him
ﬁrst? Then, earning my own living as I was born to earn
it, I might have lived on alone until this day, when,
meeting with my poor lost Ralph once more, I could,
without a blush of shame, cry ‘ Husband !’ and be to him
indeed the guardian angel his love paints I was. Heaven
knows, I wish it for his sake alone. I wish for nothing
for myself but death—yes, that would be best of all, a
thousand times.”
My lady’s once plump face looked pinched and worn,
almost as though the shadow for which she sighed was
really nigh ; her anxious eyes, not softened by her tears,
peered timorous as a hare’s to left and right, as though
the teuantless room held some one who could read her
secret soul. Then sitting down upon the sofa, with her
hands clenched before her, she stared out upon the
twilight, deepening down upon the windmill on the hill.
But presently, “ Forgive me these black thoughts,”
prayed she with inward shudder. “ If, as they say, the
place reserved for the wicked is ﬁlled with those who
have promised themselves to do some good, and have
not done it, then haply those who in their minds revolve
some deadly sin which they do not commit, may be for-
given. I will not, with God’s blessing, thus transgress
again. I know that that is wrong, and prompted by the
devil; but which is right and which is wrong in this "
(once more her eyes fell piteously upon the locket in her
hand)—-“ Lord, help me in this trial.”
Here W alter‘s ringing voice was heard upon the lawn
beneath : “Never mind pulling up the rings, Letty;
they are the best burglar-trap a householder can lay ; only
bring in the mallets and balls."
“My Walter!” exclaimed my lady, starting up with
haste. “ Have I forgotten you, then? My proud Sir
Richard, too, disgraced, dishonoured, shall men call you
bastard? My sweet Letty—never, never, never!” As
though she dared not trust herself to think, she kept re-
peating that sad word: then thrusting the dear token in

the centre of the wood and coals that were laid in the
ﬁreplace ready for the match, she set all alight.
“ Better for one to suffer than for three," she muttered
to herself. “The die is cast. I am my lady still. I
would my heart could melt away like this dull lead, and
weigh me down no more, and with this last relic of the
past, that every thought of it might likewise perish. It
can never be, I know. While this my life still holds—a
life of lies, awhited sepulchre—this sting will never lose
its venom—never, never l—Shade of the dead,” cried she,
with vehemence, turning toward the old church-tower,
which stood up black against the rising moon, “ I charge
you, witness what I do for you and yours ! Here, in this
ﬂame, I sacriﬁce not only this poor token, but the man
that was my husband; nay, who is, the man that I once
loved, nay, whom I love now ; the man that laid his life
down for my sake, with those two words, just ‘ Farewell,
Lucy.’ Great Heaven, is not this enough? Surely, now
all will go well—save for him and me. Is this too much
to ask? . . . . Forgive, forgive: I know not what
I said. Teach me to be humble, patient under every
blow, and no more vain regrets. I must act at once.
What did Arthur say? ‘The matter lay in my own hands,’
said he, whether this man should stay at Mirk or not.
How little did he know with what truth he spoke ! And
I must speak to Mary without delay, for that I alone
could stop her marriage with this man. How true again P
Well, I will do it.”
Then my lady washed her swollen eyes, and smoothed
her hair, all tangled and escaped from its sober bonds,
unturned the door-key, and having rung her bell, awaited,
with the lamp so placed that it threw her face in shadow,
the coming of her waiting-maid.

ARY," said Lady Lisgard gravely, when her
attendant had closed the door behind her,
“I want to have a little serious talk with
‘ you to-night.”
“As you please, my lady,” returned Mistress Forest, in
a tone which the other did not fail to mark: it was a very
respectful tone—a more humble one even than she was
ordinarily wont to use—but there was a certain deliberation
and set resolve about it too, which expressed, as decidedly
as though she had used the words : “ I am ready to
listen, Madam; but I know very well what you are go-
ing to ask me and I have made up my mind already to
answer ‘No.’ "
“ Mary,” continued my lady earnestly, but not without
a tremor in her kind soft voice, “ come and sit here on
the sofa beside me, and let us not be mistress and maid
to-night, but only friends.”
“Yes, Madam;" and Mary’s voice trembled too, for
this unlocked-for arrangement would place her, she knew,
at a disadvantage in the argument which was certainly at
hand. “ We have known one another many, many years,
Mary—more than half our lives—and I don’t think we
have had a single quarrel yet.” _ _
“ Not one, Ma’am, not one," assented the waiting-

maid; already, after the manner of her susceptible kind,
beginning to cry.
“I can remember you when quite a child, Mary; not
ﬁfteen years old ; as willing and kind-hearted a girl as the
sun ever shone upon; and when I had not a friend in
the world, nor even so much as a coin that I could call
my own, and when I was weak and sick at heart, having
lost all that was dear to me, I remember who it was that
tended and caressed me as though I was her own sister."
“ Don’t ye, don’t ye, my lady; hush, hush!” cried the
weeping Mary. “ It was only natural that I should take
to a sweet innocent creature cast at our very door by the
raging sea. I often dream of that storm 0’ nights,
Madam, even now; of the thunder, and the lightning,
and the rain; and of the ﬂashes that were not lightning,
but signals for help—that, alas ! we could not give—from
the poor doomed ship. And how father and the other
ﬁshermen, and many of the visitors themselves—and
among them poor Sir Robert—all crowded down to the
Cove, for they could not get nearer to the shore because
of the waves ; and I was with them, sheltering myself
in the brushwood as well as I could, and peeling through
the branches to see the great white waves lit up for an
instant, and then the darkness shutting all things out ex-
cept the roaring of the storm. I mind it just as though
it were but yesterday,- and ah ! my lady, shall I ever
forget when that one great wave dashed up into the very
Cove itself, wetting us all to the skin, and knocking down
> young Jack West, whom it almost carried back with .it in
its return, and then the great black spar, which it did
carry back, with something white a-clinging to it ; when
my father cried out: ‘Oh my God, a woman!’ and all
our hearts seemed stricken with a sudden shoot of pain.
Lordl how I cried, for my part, to think that a poor,
creature should be tossing in that dreadful foam; and
when I heard good Sir Robert’s voice, clear and loud as
a bugle: ‘One hundred pounds to the man who brings
her ashore, dead or alive 1' I do believe I could have run

out and kissed him. Ah, my lady, what a noble gentle-
man he was 3 for though he could not have known how
dear you were to be to him—you might have been an old
woman, for all he could see—how he worked and strove
to save you; not by his money alone, for no mere gain
would have tempted men to do what was done that night,
but by risking life and limb. They made a double chain,
holding one another’s hands, for there was no time to
spare for ropes, and went down almost among the
breakers, where you were : my father and Sir Robert were
the two ﬁrst men, God bless them.”
Here Mistress Forest paused, interrupted by incipient
hysterics, and my lady herself cried like a child, but not
in agony; her tears were tribute to the memory of a
gallant deed.
“ I mind my father had a black shoulder—a place you
could not cover with both your hands—all along of the
spar being driven up against him, but they carried it up
with you upon it safe into the Cove, and then there was
a great cry for us women to come down and help. Ah,
how beautiful you looked, my lady, though we thought
you dead, white, and cold, and wet, with your long black
hair dripping like sea-weed, and your tender limbs all
bruised and bleeding. It must have been a kind hand
as tied you to the plank, for between your dainty waist
and the rough rope there was bound a sailor’s jacket.”
My lady moaned, and held her hands up as though she
would say, “ Forbear !” but Mistress Forest could not he
stayed.
“ There was little enough clothes upon you, poor lady,
just a bodice and a petticoat, but round your neck there
was hung a charm or two, and perhaps that had some
hand in saving you from drowning.”
My lady looked quickly up ; how strange it seemed
that the comment passed by Mary Forest upon the locket
(and the bundle of letters in their little waterproof case)
should have been so exactly what Derrick had pointed
out it would be. The coincidence reminded her of the

task that lay before her, and of the danger of delay-
ing rt.
“ Yes, Mary, I indeed owe my life to you and yours,
and I am not forgetful of the debt. Your welfare is, and
ever will be, only second in importance to that of my
own children, and it is concerning it that I now wish to
speak with you. Your future—-"
“ You owe me nothing, my dear lady, that you have
not paid again and again, I am sure,” interrupted the
waiting-maid hurriedly. “When you rose to that high
station, for which it seems to everybody you were born,
your hand was always held out to me; through good re-
port and evil report, you have ever stood my friend: it
will be a great wrench of my heart, dearest mistress,
when I leave -your service—as I shall have to do, I fear,
very soon.”
“ Mary l"
“Yes, my lady. You see I’m not a young girl now;
and it is not everybody who has so good a chance as I
have now of—of—settling in life. Service is not inherit-
ance, you know, my lady, although I am well aware I
should never want for nothing "
“Whether I live or die, Mary," broke in her mistress
eagerly, “ I have taken care of that, good friend ,' and if
I should die to-morrow—-— But you shall see my will
itself, for it lies here.”
She laid her hand upon the desk before her, but Mary
checked her with a determined “No, my lady; no. I
was never greedy—with all my faults, you will grant that
much, I know—and if I had been like Mrs. Welsh, and
others of this household I could name—but that I never
was a mischief-maker—I might long since have put my-
self beyond all need of legacies, and you never would
have missed it. But Mr. Derrick is himself a person of
property; avery rich man indeed for one in my con-
dition of life—not that I need be a burden upon any

great present of good Sir Robert’s still untouched: the
most generous of gentlemen he was. I am sure, my lady,
nobody felt for you as I didwhen Sir Robert died ; and
you have often said how terrible it was to lose a husband;
th_erefore”— here for a moment her excessive volubility
ﬂagged for the ﬁrst time ; she paused, and reddened, then
added, with the air of a mathematician stating an indis-
putable corollary — “ therefore, you must allow, dear
mistress, that to ﬁnd one—particularly when one comes
to my time of life—is not unpleasant, nor a chance to be
lightly thrown aside.”
“That depends entirely upon the sort of husband he
may be, Mary,” observed my lady gravely.
' “ Really, dear Madam, with all respect, I think I am the
best judge of that,” rejoined the waiting-maid tartly ; “ al-
though, indeed, I never thought to say such words to
you. Sir Richard may have his likes and dislikes, but I
am not his slave ,- nor yet his servant, for the matter of
that. While Master Walter, who, saving your presence,
everybody knows to be worth a hundred of him, likes
Ralph very much."
A pang shot across my lady’s face, and left it crimson,
as though she had received a blow ; but the waiting-maid
little knew what had brought the colour there, although
she felt that she had pained her mistress deeply.
“God forgive me," cried she penitently, “if my foolish
tongue has hurt your feelings, my lady. I did not mean
to say aught against Sir Richard, I am sure. I scarcely
knew what I said, for when those who are dear to us—as
Ralph has grown to be with me, and I don’t deny it—are
misjudged and wronged, why, then we are apt to say bitter
things. This talk was none of my seeking, my lady; and
although Ralph thinks that you are to blame because of
his being forbidden the Hall, and all the rest of it, I
have always told him you have never said a word
to set me against him ; and oh, I am sorry you are
doing it now, because what is done cannot be undone,

“Great Heaven! you are not married to this man?"
cried my lady, rising from her seat with agitation.
“Oh no, my lady—certainly not, my lady,” rejoined
the waiting-maid with a certain demure dignity. “ There
has been nothing underhand between us in the matter at
all, except, that is, so far as meeting Mr. Derrick at the
back gate ”
“Did you go out to meet him lO-llllg/lt 7 ” inquired Lady
Lisgard sharply, and keeping her eyes ﬁxed steadily upon
her attendant's face.
“No, Madam, I did not." '
“She is speaking truth,” murmured my lady to herself.
“ Who, then, could it be whom I saw upon the church-
yard path just now ? ”
“Although,” continued Mrs. Forest quietly, “I don't
deny that I have often met him after dusk, no other time
being permitted to us : but to-day he has gone to town]?
“And you are to write to him thither to give him your
ﬁnal decision as to whether you will become his wife or
not.”
“ How on earth do you know that, my lady? ” inquired
the waiting-maid with a curiosity ev'en beyond her in-
dignation.
“ I do know it, dear old friend,” answered Lady Lisgard
tenderly, “and it is because of that knowledge that I '
have sent for you to-night, to strive to persuade you to
write ‘No,’ while there is yet time.”
It was very seldom—-not once in a year perhaps—that
Mary Forest was ever out of temper with my lady; but
then such a supreme occasion as the present had never
occurred before. Underneath their mere superficial re-
lation of mistress and servant, they were more like elder
and younger sister; but then even sisters quarrel when
the one wants the other—generally under some pretence
of mere prudence, not to be listened to by a woman of
spirit—to give up the man of her choice. The ample
countenance of Mistress Forest expressed something
more than decision in the negative ,- there was an un-

pleasant smile upon her pale lips, which seemed to say:
“If you knew what I know, you would know that you
are wasting your breath.” She sat with her plump hands
folded before her, like a naughty boy who has been put
in the corner, but who does not care—nay, more, who
knows that he has got a cracker to put presently under
his master’s chair, the results of which will make full
amends for the inconvenience he at present experiences.
“ I will say nothing more, Mary, of the mutual esteem
and affection between us two, and of the pain that an
eternal parting—such as your marriage with this Mr.
Derrick would most undoubtedly entail—needs must cost
us both. I presume that you have weighed that matter
in your mind, and found it—however weighty—in-
sufﬁcient to alter your determination?”
Mary nodded, sharply enough, but it was doubtful if
she could have spoken. Already her features had lost
their rigidity, as though melted by my lady’s touching
tones. 4
“You have known this person—that is to say, you
have met him some dozen times—during a period of less
than four months ; yet such is his inﬂuence over you, that
you are prepared to sacriﬁce for him a friend of thirty
years' standing, a comfortable home, and a position in
which you are respected by all who know you. If I was
speaking to a young girl, Mary, I should not advance
these arguments; but you are a—a wise and sensible
woman, and yet not of such a mature age that you need
despair of ﬁnding a suitable partner for the rest of your
life."
Mistress Forest heaved a little sigh of relief, and her
cheeks began to tone down to something like their
natural crimson; they Izad been purple with the an
prehension of what my lady might have said upon the
subject of age.
“Now, what is it," pursued my lady, “ which has pro-
duced this conﬁdence in an almost entire stranger? Do
you know anything of his former life, which may be a

you ever met a single individual who is acquainted with
it in any way? For all you know, this man may have
been a "
“My lady l ”
For a moment, the relative position of Mentor and
pupil were exchanged ; there was a quiet power about the
waiting-maid’s rebuke, for which an archbishop would
have given more than his blessing, if he could only have
incorporated it into a “ charge."
“You are right, Mary,” said my lady frankly; “let us
only speak of what is within our own knowledge. Does
this man’s own conduct, then, give any promise of lasting
happiness to the woman who may become his wife? Is
he sober?” ,
. “ I believe he is fond of a glass, my lady, as most men
are who have no home, or people to look after them. If
he had a wife he would never go to the public-house at
all, perhaps—he tells me so himself.”
My lady smiled faintly.
“ Is he industrious and provident, Mary?"
“ He has earned his money hardly enough, my lady,
and it seems only natural that he should now spend a
little in enjoying himself."
“But not ﬂing his money to left and right—I use
your own words, dear Mary—and treat every chance-
companion he comes across to liquor. Do you suppose
that at his age he is likely to change habits of that
sort?”
“I am not aware, my lady, that his age is anything
against him,” replied the waiting-maid coldly. “He is
not so likely to run through his money as if he were
younger, and particularly when he has got some one to
provide for beside himself. And indeed, so far as money
goes, he has thousands of pounds; and if all goes well
with him—and something has occurred to-day about
which he has sent me a line by hand, dear fellow, by
which it has been made almost certain that things will

two. There is some great race on Epsom Downs—-——”
“ Oh Mary, how can you talk so cheerfully of money
acquired in that way. If it is won to-day it is lost to-
morrow; and even if it were not so, do you know that
it is gained from those who can ill afford to lose it, and
who, having lost it, often turn to wicked ways P "
“I don’t know about that, my lady, I’m sure,” re-
sponded the waiting-maid demurely; “I leave all these
things to my betters. But, I suppose, if racing was a
crime, Mr. Chifney would not be let to have the Abbey
Farm—Sir Richard being so very particular—and Master
Walter would not for ever be up at the stables. Why, he
and Mr. Derrick are both together, hand and glove, in
this very business—~something about a French racer, it
is; although, when you and I were at Dijon, my lady,
we never heard of there being such a thing in all France,

after all. And please, Ma’am, it is no use saying any-
thing more about it, for I have written him that letter
already which he was to ﬁnd in London, and put it in the.

“ And did you answer ‘ Yes,’ or ‘ No,’ Mary ? ”
“I answered ‘ Yes,’ my lady—that I would marry him
—and begging your pardon, Madam, but I mean to stand
to it.”

CHAPTER XVI.
CONFESSION.
' 1 HERE is one serious disadvantage—which mis-
‘ tresses should do well to remember—at which
waiting-maids are always placed in disputations
with their domestic superiors; they cannot
(except they are prepared for instant dismissal) either
quit the room and bang the door after them, or leave it
open, and run down stairs “saying things ” at the top of
their voices. Both these modes of procedure, so natural
to the female when “put out,” are denied to them, for
the same reason that when on board ship they can’t take
champagne for sea-sickness as their employers do ; they
cannot afford the indulgence.
Now, although Mary Forest was not debarred by mere
pecuniary considerations from ﬂinging herself out of her
mistress’s room when she cried, “And I mean to stand
to it," there were other reasons which prevented her from
suiting to her words that‘very appropriate and natural
action. In all her blinding passion (and she was really
very angry), she never quite lost sight of the respect she
owed her mistress. Her devotion to her was such, that
even while she listened t9 her most unpalatable
arguments against the man she had accepted for her
husband, her heart smote her with a sense of ingratitude
towards the long-tried friend, who, after all, she knew,
was anxious for her happiness rather than for her own

Conﬁssr'on. I4!
mere comfort ; and when she seemed most obstinate,
she had often been nearest to throwing herself upon her
mistress’s neck, and exclaiming: “You are quite right,
my lady; and I believe I have been an old fool all along."
It was more with the desire of putting a stop to this most
unpleasant dispute, than because her determination was
absolutely adamantine and inﬂexible, that she once more
reiterated: “Yes, my lady, I mean to stand to it,” and
ﬁxed her eyes doggedly upon the ﬂoor, as though she
would not even encounter another questioning glance.
“ Mary,” said her mistress solemnly, and after a. long
silence, “ I am grieved beyond all power of words to tell
at what you have just said ; but the mischief may not yet
be quite past mending. I have seen this—Mr. Derrick
—this very night, and therefore he will not receive your
letter till, at earliest, to-morrow evening."
“ N 0, nor then either, my lady, so far as that goes, for
I was late for the London post ; I put the letter in the
box for the very reason that I might not be persuaded to
change my mind by ”
“Then it has not yet left the village post-ofﬁce," in-
terrupted my lady, hastily snatching up her bonnet from
the table on which she had wearily put it down upon
entering the room: “there is time to stop it yet."
“No, my lady; I heard the postman’s horn half an
hour ago ; and if it were otherwise, nothing would induce
me _to alter what I have already written—nothing—
nothing!" repeated Mistress Forest, emphasising her last
two words by beating with her foot upon the carpet.
“Alas, dear friend, you know not what you say,” re-
plied my lady very gravely. “Give me your hand, Mary;
nay, do not withdraw it coldly, for you will have need of
comfort and support, almost as much, alas, as I
zllary, Mary, 1111': 1mm is married already I" The waiting-
maid started from her seat with a shrill scream.
“ I don’t believe it, I won’t believe it ; it is false. How
dare you tell a lie to me, Lady Lisgard, only to gain your
ends ? " '

I42 Mrk A bbey.
“ Hush, hush, Mary; did you ever know me to tell a lie,
my friend ? It is true as that yonder moon is rising, that
this man has a wife alive. Do not weep so passionately."
“ The perjured villain ; the false, bad man ; the wicked,
wicked wretch l” cried the waiting-maid, her eyes ﬂashing
through their tears. '
“Nay, above all, do not blame lzim, Mary, for he
knows it not himself; he does not, indeed.”
“What? Not know whether he's married or not I"
sobbed the unhappy bride-elect. “I don’t believe t/zat,
at all events, even if I believe you. He has mam'ed so
many, he doesn’t know rightly who is his wife; that is
what you mean, I see. Sailors are all alike. Oh dear,
dear, dear, when Mrs. Welsh comes to know of it. And
the monster will have got my letter by to-morrow night, to
show about. How nearly have I been committing bi—
bi—bigamy l ”
“Calm yourself, dear Mary, calm yourself. Your
trouble is nothing to what I suffer, and must continue to
endure for my life long.”
“ Ah, my lady, I dare say it is very bad to be a widow';
but it’s much worse to die an old leastways, at forty-
ﬁ—or forty-four, rather—to lose Oh dear! what an
honest man he looked, and such abeard and eyes. I
will never trust to appearances again. I dare say, it is
very wrong, my lady, but I fee—fee—feel as though I
could tear Mrs. Derrick's eyes out ; I do, indeed.” Here
the bottle of smelling-salts, which upon a certain occasion
we saw used by Mary Forest for the recovery of her
mistress, had to change hands. The unfortunate waiting-
maid was taken with a very genuine ﬁt of hysterics, and
not of the quiet sort either ,- and if her senses left her, it
could not certainly be said that she also lost the use of
her limbs. At last, exhausted in body, but also more reason-
able as to her mind, she whispered: “Mistress, dearest,
tell me all you know.” Then my lady knew that the time
was come for her ﬁrst self-luimiliation. Throughout the
narrative that followed, they were sitting upon the sofa

Confession. :43
together hand in hand, but each had her face averted
from the other, and only now and then by a convulsive
grasp of the ﬁngers, did Mary show her sympathy with
her unhappy- mistress. At ﬁrst she was too full of her
own trouble to interrupt by words, but soon the astound-
ing revelations from my lady‘s lips overwhelmed every
faculty of speech within her, and she sat like a child who
listens to a horrid story in the darkening twilight.
“We have known one another more than half our
lives, Mary, said I, a while ago, and yet there has been a
secret between us all that time. I have never kept any-
thing else from you, but this was not mine alone to tell;
it was Sir Robert’s also. When he asked me to become
his wife at Coveton, and you thought me so mad for ﬁrst
refusing him, and afterwards for demanding such a long
delay, I had a reason for it, which he knew, but which
you have never guessed. I was then the three-weeks’
bride of another man—You may well start, Mary, but
that is the dreadful truth. The man, Ralph Gavestone,
whom I mourned so deeply, as being drowned with my
dear parents, and all the rest of the ship’s company, in ~
that great storm—which I would to Heaven had
whelmed me in its waves—was not my half-brother, as
Sir Robert persuaded me to give out, but my husband.”
“You had no wedding-ring, my lady, when you came
ashore,” murmured the waiting-maid half incredulously.
“That is true, Mary. I know not how it was, but
perhaps the cold and wet of that dreadful night made
my ﬁngers shrink—you remember how wan and thin I
looked—and the ring must have dropped off; I never
saw it after I reached land. But I was none the less a
widow—as I thought; and although friendless, save for
you, Mary—homeless and penniless, I thought I could
never take another husband to my arms, although the
raging sea had worked that rough divorce between us.
At ﬁrst, I replied: ‘No, Sir Robert, never ;’ you will
bear me witness that I did. Then, when he pressed me
still, I bargained for three years. I thought that he

would tire of waiting for me, and get some ﬁtter mate in
the meantime; I did, as Heaven is my judge. I was
true to my poor Ralph—he had saved me upon that spar
at the risk, and, as I then believed, at the sacriﬁce of
his own life—as long as I—nay, I was true to him in a
sense for ever. Sir Robert was well aware of that. I
do not need justiﬁcation from man or woman ; God him-
self absolved me, I think, so far. But that was an evil
day, Mary, when I married. I was no more Sir Robert’s
wife than you were, Mary. Think of that. And he was
not my husband. And our children, of whom he was so
proud, are baseborn—bastards. Sir Richard—is it not
terrible? do you not wonder that I live and am not
mad P—he is not Sir Richard. And my dear, dear
Walter, he is baseborn too. And Letty—for whom her
eldest brother thinks nobody too high—she, too, is no
Lisgard. If I had waited seven years instead of three,
this would not have been so. There are law-books in
the library which have told me so much ; but I have no
adviser—none ; no friend—yes, you, Mary, I know—but
not one who can help me. Is not this something worse
than death itself which has fallen upon me? ”
“And this man Derrick—he was Gavestone?” whis-
pered Mary Forest in a hoarse grating voice.
“Yes; did I not tell you so? I only found it out
last Christmas Eve. I knew his voice, and I knew the
carol that he sang. For one thing only do I thank
Heaven—I who had reason, as I thought, to be thank-
ful for so many things—that Sir Robert is not alive. Ilis
sleep in yonder churchyard is disturbed by no such ghastly
dream. Ah, happy dead l "
“Mistress, beloved mistress," cried the waiting-maid,
in an agony of remorse—“forgive me that I have been
thinking of myself these many weeks, while you have
been so burdened and tormented. Henceforth, I am
yours only. As I hope to get to heaven when I die, I
will be true to you whatever happens. Let us think what
that may be."


## p. 145 (#151) ############################################

C011 anion. 1 4 5
“ Nay, let us not think," exclaimed her mistress with a
shudder, “or I shall lose my wits. Would you have me
picture what this house would be should 1:: come hither
and claim me for his wife? Richard and he beneath the
self-same roof, and he the master! Would Walter——
though he herds with him, you say—brook this man as
his equal? Would he not loathe him rather, and how
soon, ah me ! unlearn the love he owes to me—his
wretched mother! I cannot bear to think of it, "I tell
you. Let us act; let us be doing something—some-
thing! How my brain whirls! Think for me, Mary
—pray for me, for Heaven is deaf, alas, to my poor
prayers l”
But even while l'she spoke, the gracious tears began to
ﬁll the furrows in her cheeks, which until now had been
dry throughout her talk 3 and having told her friend, the
weight about her heart was lifted oﬂ" a little, and the
tightness round her brow was loosened by the blessed
hand of sympathy.
“I must write to him at once,” said Mary thought-
fully. “How fortunate that he did .not leave Mirk until
to-night. The two letters will now reach him at the same
time. He cannot write in answer to the one which—
which I wrote ﬁrst—without having read the other ,' that
will be something saved."
My lady shook her head.
“ There is but little hope in that, I fear ; for he him-
self has this night told me—yes, I saw him face to face,
Mary, only I was thickly veiled, thank Heaven—he told
me frankly (thinking I did not wish to lose my waiting-
maid) that he should lay it to my charge if your reply
was ‘ No,’ and should not take it as the answer of your
heart. How much more, if he gets a refusal coining so
quickly upon the very heels of this acceptance, will he
decline to believe it comes from your own self. More
likely, it would cause him, reckless as he is, to do some-
thing rash and vengeful—perhaps to return hither on
the instant, and Oh Mary, Mary, I would give ﬁve

thousand pounds this day, if that would stop his coming
to Mirk again l"
“ Would that 110! stop him, mistress? ” asked the wait-
ing-maid with earnest gravity. “Five thousand pounds is
a fortune, is it not? ”
' “It would not stop lu'm, Mary," rejoined my lady
sadly. “Ralph Gavestone, even in his youth-time, never
valued money a ﬁllip when weighedgainst a whim 3 and
now his will is more a law to him than ever. I have
never known resolve so ﬁxed as I read it in his eyes
this night. And if he guessed the truth, Mary—oh, if
he did but dream that I, his lawful wife, for whom he
had gladly laid his own life down, whose memory he has
kept fresh and green when all else has withered, whose
loss has been his min, was playing him false l—he said
himself, that on his reckless soul ’twas like as not there
might be murder some day—and, Mary, I do believe
him.” ' ‘
White as the very moonbeams was my lady’s face, and
the hand trembled which held the handkerchief she
passed across her damp white brow.
“ Not for myself, good Mary, is this fear," gasped she,
“but for my dear ones—do you hear them yonder P is it
not sad to listen to such mirth ?—for this unhappy man
being wronged, becomes a madman straightway. Not
disgrace alone may fall upon us here, not only shame—
thinlt of that, Mary; not only shame upon Sir Richard
and the rest; but even crime may visit us. This house
of dead Sir Robert—once the home of peace, and genial
ease, and hospitality But that shall never be 5 no,
they shall never meet, my sons and he ; I will die rather,
and my corpse would part them wide enough."
“ Oh, mistress, talk not so ; you freeze my very blood.
What was it we were saying before you began to look
like this P "
“ You talked of bribing this Ralph Gavestone—for
how could I offer him gold save as a bribe? But if a
bribe, what need was there to bribe him P Why should

I wish him once more upon the other side of the world P
Why pay him a younger brother’s portion, to quit the
courtship of my waiting-maid? No, Mary, this man is
no mere rogue, that he should take his money without
question, and be oh" ; he is suspicious, keen—and ah, if
wronged, as implacable as death itself.”
“One moment, my lady ! ” cried Mistress Forest leap-
ing to her feet. “I do believe I have a plan to get that
letter back.”
“Ah, good Heaven ! What is it, wise, kind heart P"
“See, Madam,” and she began to reckon on her
plump ﬁngers, with her pleasant face aglow with mingled
joy and astonishment at her own sagacity: “the note
was put in late for the London post from Dalwynch ; it
will therefore remain there, though it has left Mirk, all
to-night, and not be forwarded till the morning mail. If
we drive over to-morrow early— starting, say, at six
o’clock—we shall be in plenty of time to stop its going
further. In the meantime, I will write another letter in
its place.”
“ You have saved me—for this time—I do believe,
dear Mary ; yes, we can drive to Dalwynch—I will give
orders for the carriage to be ready at six—and still be
back at the Abbey by breakfasvtime. If we are pressed
for the reason, we can give the true one—to acertain
point, if needs must be—you had a mind to alter what
you have written to your suitor.”

CHAPTER XVII.
CONTRARY TO THE REGULATXONS OF HER MAJESTY’S
POST-OFFICE.
ORELY did the fat coachman, who had no
neck, inveigh against that caprice of his mis-
tress which compelled his appearance at the
front door upon the ensuing morning at an
hour so altogether unexampled. If he had but heard
that it was all upon the account of Mistress Forest, and
the outlandish fellow who wore little gold rings in his
ears, and that curly beard, so like the door-mat of the
servants’Jtall, it is doubtful whether he would have
obeyed such a premature behest at all ; but as it was,
he was sitting on the coach-box with the sleek nags
before him, at the foot of the great steps which led
down from the entrance-hall, at six o’clock to a minute.
It was broad daylight of course, so bright that it made
him wink again, as it ﬂashed upon the glittering harness
and the shining skins of the pampered beasts; but still
it was not a time for a man of his years and girth to be
hurried up and made to toil. “As late as you please at
night, my lady, and nobody ever heard Joe Wiggins utter
a murmur," muttered he; “but there’s no constitushun
as can stand such wear and tear as Mir.” -
-However that might be with Mr. Wiggins, Miss Rose
Aynton seemed to make uncommonly light of early
rising, for much to the astonishment of her hostess, She

was up and dressed and in the breakfast-room when that
lady made her appearance at half-past ﬁve.
“I happened to hear that you were going out be-
times, dear Lady Lisgard,” said she with her sweetest
smile ,' “and getting up in these ﬁrst summer mornings
is SIM/l a treat to a poor London-bred girl like me ; so,
without saying a word to dearest Letty, I thought I
would just ﬁll her place for once, and make your coffee
for you."
“ Thank you, Rose,” returned my lady a little stitﬁy, for
she had not intended that anybody, and far less one who
was not a member of her own family, should have been
a witness to her departure. “I have unpleasant business
on hand which takes me to Dalwynch before the morn-
ing train'starts.” .
“If you are going to London,” began Rose hesi-
tatingly, as if intending to send something by my lady's
hands to her aunt, “if it was not too much trouble "
“I am not going to London," replied Lady Lisgard
quietly. “ I shall be back by the usual breakfast-hour, I
have no doubt.”
Here my lady sipped her coffee with the air of a
connoisseur, and perceiving Miss Aynton was about to
ask more questions, requested a little sugar; then a fresh
supply of—no, not hot milk—some cream. Would the
carriage never come round, and release her from this
importunate girl. -
“ How glad the people will be to see you about again
once more, Lady Lisgard," observed Miss Aynton cheer-
fully. “ You can’t imagine how curious they have been
to know why you have shut yourself up so long.”
“ I was not aware that my movements were any busi-
ness of theirs, Rose,” returned my lady with severity,
“nor, indeed, of anybody’s except myself.”
“ Very true," answered Miss Aynton carelessly '; “that
is what I always told them. Besides, it is not pleasant
to run the chance of meeting a rude and perhaps half—
tlrunken ruﬁian like this man Derrick, when one knows

he has made up his mind to address one upon the ﬁrst
opportunity.”
“Indeed!” said my lady scornfully, “I assure you I
was quite unaware of that dreadful menace.” She stole
a glance over her cup, to see if there was anything to
read in this strange girl’s face; but there was nothing.
As soon as she had ﬁnished her duties in connection
with the coffee-pot, she had taken a piece of fancy-work
in her hands, in the execution of which she seemed
entirely wrapped up.
“ Oh yes ,- of course it is most ridiculous, but that is
what all the village has been saying for these ﬁve months,
more or less; and now that you are going out for the

“How do you know, Rose, that this man left Mirk
last night?” in( uired my lady, setting down her cup,‘
and looking at t e young girl ﬁxedly. Could it possibly
have been s/ze whom she had beheld lurking about the
churchyard wall, and perhaps listening to the conversa-
tion, in the course of which Derrick had announced his
intention of going at that late hour to Dalwynch, so as
to be in time for the ﬁrst up-train upon the morrow P
A faint ﬂush stole over Miss Anyton’s face, but by
no means such a blush as is called “ tell-tale : " it might
easily enough have been caused by the mere directness
of the question. “Your son, Mr. Walter, told me,"
replied she simply—“ he is a great ally of this man’s, you
know—Here is the carriage. I am afraid you will ﬁnd
it very dull, Lady Lisgard, taking this long drive all
alone. If I thought that my company "
“Thank you, Rose," replied my lady hastily; “it is
most kind of you to offer it ; but the fact is, I am going
to take Forest with me. This visit to Dalwynch is
mainly upon her account, indeed. If the chariot held
more than two, perhaps I should take you at your word;
but as it is See, I have a book for my companion.—
Come, Forest; we have no time to lose.”

Mary had entered the room while she was speaking,
and gave quite a start at seeing Miss Anyton at the
breakfast-table. Her mistress was already cloaked, and
had her bonnet on.
“To Dalwynch, my lady?” said the footman, having
put up the steps and closed the chariot-door.
“ Yes; drive fast.”
“ Which part of the town, my lady? " for there were
two roads to the post-town, the relative length of which
from the Abbey depended upon what part of the place
was to be visited.
Miss Aynton was standing on the last ﬂight of the
stone steps, and could hear every word that was spoken.
“Take the lower road,” replied my lady very dis-
tinctly ; and the well-hung chariot—pleasantest invention
save the fair-weather Hansom, which the wit of coach-
makers has yet sought out—rolled swiftly along the
gravelled road.
“ Then they are not going to the railway station,” ex-
claimed Rose aloud.
“No, Miss," assented the butler, as he stood at the
'open hall-door, regarding nature as though it were a
novelty to him at that hour. “ I should say it must be
the post-ofﬁce. Perhaps my lady wishes to get the
letters this morning earlier than the Mirk’s man can
bring them.”
“Very likely, Roberts,” returned the young lady, a
little disconcerted at her involuntary remark having been
overheard. “Let us hope she will have good news. But
I should scarcely have thought it was necessary to have
gone herself.”
“Well, I am not so sure, Miss. Mrs. Rudd, the post-
mistress at Dalwynch, is a great sticklcr for forms and
that, and she might— have made some difﬁculty, par-
ticularly as she did not obtain her place through our
influence."
“ lV/zorz inﬂuence, Roberts P ”

see, was given last election to the losing side. Although
time was, I can well recollect, when poor Sir Robert had
everything of that sort at his disposal that was vacant
in these parts; but them yallers, they have gone and
spoilt it all this time.” And with a sigh of regret for
the golden age of patronage, and a shake of the head
directed against the levelling opinions at present in the
ascenclant, Mr. Roberts went off to his breakfast.
No sooner had the wheels of the chariot began to
move, than Lady Lisgard observed to her companion:
“ You have the letter with you that I dictated last night,
have you not P "
“ Yes, my lady; here it is, though not sealed down, in
case you might have thought of anything to add.”
“ No, Mary,” said her mistress, perusing it ,- “there is
nothing here that I can better by thought, although I
spent all night in thinking over it. A refusal could
scarce be made shorter or more decided than this; there
is not a trace of vacillation to give the most sanguine
suitor hope." Then, as if some other idea was express-
ing itself almost in spite of herself, she added: “Do I
not look deadly pale, Mary P "
“ Very white and worn, Madam, as you well may.”
“But bad enough for people to observe who did not
know the cause P ”
“ For some people, Madam. S/ze saw it sharp enough,
if you mean lzcr my lady," and the waiting-maid made
a signiﬁcant gesture, in the direction of Miss Rose
Aynton. “Nothing escapes lzer, bless you—nothing;
and the sooner she’s out of the house, under present
circumstances—and indeed under every circumstance, in
my opinion—the better.”
“ You never liked her from the ﬁrst, l‘lary,” said
her mistress in the tone of one who argues against her
own conviction. “We should not be uncharitable in
our judgments of others, and particularly as respects
young folks ; we often set down as serious faults what in
them is mil-,1 thoughtlessncss.”

“Miss Aynton is none of that sort, my lady; she
always thinks before she speaks, and takes a good long
look before she leaps; and for all she seems as though
butter would not melt in her mouth, she’s as full 0’
schemes as a cat at a dairy-door. If there’s cream to be
got in this world, she’ll get it, my lady, I’ll go bail, let
the butter-milk fall to whose share it will.”
“I confess that I can’t quite understand her," said my
lady musing. “I am sure, when she ﬁrst came, she .
seemed simple and unobtrusive enough; while, on the
other hand, in her manner towards me of late—”
“Downright impudence, I call it, my lady, in such a
chit as she." '
“Well, I don't say that ; but she is certainly not so
respectful as she might be. I shall be sorry to send her
back to London just as the summer is beginning, to live
with her cross old aunt, whom she appears to dislike so ;
but I confess I think she has been here long enough.”
“Much too long, my lady, much too long,” answered
Mary Forest gravely; “she has set more people in the
house by the ears than you wot of. While Anne Rees,
who used to be Miss Letty’s maid, one would think Miss
Aynton was her mistress now, so entirely has she got her
under her thumb. She has ferreted out some folly of
Anne’s—Heaven knows how she did it, or what it is;
but the girl's her slave. From whom but her did she
learn that you were starting at this hour? And, again,
why was not Miss Letty told as well as Miss Rose P Do
you suppose she would have let anybody else make
coffee for her mamma, if she had been aware of your
departure? No, no. Then Miss Aynton will take
credit to herself for not permitting Miss Letty to be
called, and fatigue herself by getting up so early. Nasty,
sly young hussy! That’s just her way ; uncommon civil,
kind, and attentive, until she gets the upper hand, and
ﬁnds you under her thumb ; then you begin to know her.

makes a fool of old Roberts yet. She actually told him,

that at the last dinner-party at the Abbey she thought
him the most distinguished-looking person in the room ;
but only wait till she catches him some afternoon at the
Madeira! then he’ll be her obedient, humble servant,
without having any more pretty speeches. That’s a bad,
bold girl, Ma’am, let her be ten times a lady born.”
Here Mistress Forest, indignantly tossing her head
back, without making due allowance for her bonnet,
came into sharp contact with the back of the chariot,
and severely bit her tongue. My lady was thereby en-
abled to interpose a remark.
“ But why have you not told me a word of this before,
Mary ? I would never have permitted a guest of mine,
and particularly ayoung lady to whom I stand in the
relation of guardian while she is under my roof, ﬁrst to
ingratiate herself with my servants, and then to tyrannise
over them in the way you describe. I never heard of
anything more atrocioust mean, and I think you have
been wanting in your duty let alone your personal
regard for me, Mary—to have concealed the matter so
lon ."
“gBegging your pardon, my lady, you have nobody to
blame but yourself for that,” observed the waiting-maid
with asperity. “The only harsh words you ever spoke
to me were about certain of Mrs. Welsh’s doings, of
which I complained with reason, though I do not wish
to refer to them now. What you said was this : ‘ Never
abuse the affectionate relation in which we two stand,
Mary, by causing me to side with you against your
fellow-servants. I can deny you nothing, but do not vex
me with tale-bearing. I hate all vulgar gossip, and de-
spise those who bring it.’ After a setting-down like that,
it was not likely that I should give tongue about Miss
Aynton’s ways, nor let you know how she has made
Anne Rees a spy upon us all. N 0, no ; mind your own
business, Mary Forest, says you 3 and I’ve minded it, my
lady, ever since.”
“Do not be angry with me, friend,” returned Lady

Lisgard sadly; “I dare say I was wrong; and even if
not, I have no heart to argue with you now."
“And no wonder, poor dear,” assented the waiting-
maid, greatly molliﬁed. “ I was a brute to bring it up
against you just now in all this trouble; nor was it the
right time, perhaps, to speak about Miss Aynton’s goings
on. Only you yourself said her manner was not quite
what it used’to be, and I was so afraid that she might be
getting 1011, my lady, under her thumb.”
“How could that possibly be, Mary? She cannot
have the slightest suspicion of ”
“She sniffs something, my lady, or she would not have
been making your coffee this morning. However, let
her sniff, only be you very. careful to lock your desk;
and when you want to say anything to me about you
know who, come out of earshot of the keyhole of your
own door.—Ah, wouldn’t she, though? But I know
better. A thief? No, I didn’t say a thief, although, for
the matter of that, she has a mind to steal from you, or
I am much mistaken, something you value most on earth
—your son. There now, I’ve said it.”
And the waiting-maid drew a very long breath, as
though some oppressive weight was off her mind at last.
She evidently expected her mistress to express astonish-
ment, if not horror; and' it was positively a disappoint-
ment to her when my lady replied calmly: “I know all
about that, Mary; but you are doing Miss ,Aynton
wrong. She might have been my danghter-indaw if she
liked, and yet, to my certain knowledge, she refused to
be so.”
“ She refusal 7 ” _
“ Most certainly she did. My son made her an offer
in my presence, and she rejected him—But here we are
at Dalwynch. Tell Wiggins to stop at the post-ofﬁce.
Thank Heaven, there is plenty of time to spare. How
my heart does beat I " '
The waiting-maid pulled the checkstring, and (le-
livered her inislress’s orders, but quite mechanically,

without knowing what she said. In spite of the im-
portance of what she had now so immediately to do, her
mind was entirely occupied with the wonder of what she
had just heard, and she kept repeating to herself : “And
she rejected him? and she rejected him?” while her
heightened eyebrows almost amalgamated with her hair.
Perhaps some of this excessive astonishment was due to
poor Mistress Forest’s peculiar position ; she thought it
so strange that one of her own sex should reject any
man—who was not already married to somebody else.
“ Here is the post-ofﬁce, Mary. Mind you speak very
civilly to the woman, and make haste ,' I shall be in a
perfect fever till I see you come back with that dreadful
. letter safe in your hand.” '
One minute, two minutes, three minutes—each seem-
ing an hour to my lady, shrinking in a corner of the
chariot, while the omnibus to the station passed and re-
passed, picking up she knew not what passengers, and
bearing Derrick himself, for all she knew, within it. At
last Lady Lisgard could endure the suspense no longer.
“John,” said she to the footman standing beside the
door, “ what is Forest about P Why does she not
return P ”
“ She is talking to Mrs. Rudd, my lady. I think there
is some dispute about a letter; for they are both in the
post-oﬁice department.”
“Let me out, John,” exclaimed my lady impatiently;
and the next instant she had entered Mrs. Rudd's
establishment. This was, for the most part, a grocer’s
shop; one-ﬁfth of it only being reserved for the recep-
tion and despatch of Her Majesty’s mails. There were
no customers at that still early hour ; a young man who
was sanding the ﬂoor with 'some ostentation, as though to
imply that all the sand went that way, and none into the
sugar, made a respectable pause as my lady’s silk swept
by ; and another, who appeared to be washing his hands
in tea, assumed that sickly smile which is supposed by
persons of his class to conciliate people of quality ,- but

Mrs. Rudd herself, intrenched behind her little post-
oflice palisade, gave no sign of gracious welcome and
from out the pigeon-hole through which she distributed
her stamps, her words poured forth in an undiminished
stream of denial and severity ; nay, I doubt whether the
presence of my lady did not intensify the bitterness of
its tone.
“Whatever importance it may be to you to get this
letter, Mistress Forest," cried she, addressing poor Mary,
who was looking very disconsolate, and not a little angry
also, “ it is of much greater moment to me that I should
keep it. It is as much as my place is worth to give a letter
back which has oncebeen given into my charge ; and I
am not aware that I owe that place to my Lady Lisgard,
and therefore feel called upon to risk I beg pardon,
your ladyship—but I did not catch sight of you before.
What your servant has come to ask of me is something out
of the question. I will post this second letter for her—
although it is two minutes past the time, even with an
extra stamp, for t/zat—but as for returning her this other:
yes, I have no doubt it's hers—although, for that matter,
people’s handwriting is often very like other people’s—but
directly it reached this box it became the property of
the Postmaster-general. It is no more hers now than it
is mine ; and if I was to yield it up, it’s a matter, Madam,
that might be brought before the assizes.”
“ Mrs. Rudd," said my lady quietly. “ I hope,
although your late husband and my son were not quite
of the same way of thinking as to politics, that you do
not look upon me in an unneighbourly light. I do not
wish to insult you by offering you a bribe; but I may
say this much, that nobody ever put me under an obliga-
tion yet, without my endeavouring to recompense them
to the best of my power.”
“Yes, my lady—although I can’t say as I have ever
been overburdened with favours at your ladyship‘s hands
—I know what sugar and currants goes to the Abbey
from Simmons’s every week—enough for a regiment, I'm

sure, and at such a price, too, and all because he voted
blue ”
“Voting blue, Mrs. Rudd,” interrupted my lady, “is
nothing at all compared with the good service you would
do me, if you could only oblige my maid in the matter
of this letter. Her future happiness, I may say, is bound
up in the mere fact of that little note arriving or not at
its destination."
“Mr. 12. Derrida, Turf Hosz Pitcadilly,” muttered
Mrs. Rudd, looking at the address over the top of her
silver spectacles. “I should like to have half the Abbey
grocery custom very much, of course."
“You shall have it,” whispered my lady in broken
tones.
“But I dare not do it,” continued the post-mistress.
“This might be held over me—if it ever came to be
known—so that I should never be my own mistress
again, which, now that Rudd is gone, I mean to be.
When you have once done an illegal action, my lady,
you may just as well be a. slave—until you have taken
your punishment. Somebody is sure to get wind of it,
and to put you under their thumb.”
My lady gave a ghastly smile, for speech was not in
her.
“ Look here, Mrs. Rudd,” interposed Mistress Forest
softly, “you are not asked either to destroy or to give
up this letter—of the inside of which, if you please, I
will tell you every word. It is written to my lover—
that’s the fact ; and I am veiy, very anxious that he
should receive it "—here she trod upon my lady’s foot
with unmistakable emphasis—“should receive it by this
night’s post.”
“Well, so he will,” returned the post-mistress, “in
Piccadilly.”
“Yes, but Mr. Derrick is n0! in Piccadilly,” urged the
waiting-maid. “The direction should be ‘ Can'of Mr.
Alt/mr ]1a/11r111¢’—what court is it, my lady P—Yes ;

Mat, Mrs. Rudd, upon the envelope, instead of the
present address, all mischief will be avoided. Would it
not, my lady?”
“There seems no great harm in that,” said Mrs. Rudd
reﬁectively.
“ No harm _whatever, and a great deal of good to you,"
murmured the waiting-maid, as with a rapid hand she
crossed out the words already written, and substituted
for them the address of Mr. Haldane’s law-chambers.
“Thank you kindly. Now, please to stamp this other.
I am so much obliged.”
“And I too,” said my lady graciously. “Be so kind,
Mrs. Rudd, as to let me take your list of groceries with
me. What nice macaroni that looks—I ﬁnd such a.
difﬁculty in getting it in the country pure.”
Mrs. Rudd herself accompanied my lady to her
chariot, and courtesied to the ground as the chariot
whirled away.
No sooner were they alone, than mistress and maid
exchanged a hearty kiss. “ Thank you, thank you, dear-
Mary,” cried the former; “without your presence of
mind, what should we have done! I began to feel quite
prostrate with despair, and even now I tremble to think
how nearly we had failed. I could not go through such
a scene again, I believe, even if my life depended
upon it.”
“Ah, yes, you could, my lady; and I only trust it
may not be necessary for you to do so. There is nothing
more, however, to be done at present, save to wait and
hope—except the telegraph message. I ventured to tell
John, ‘To the railway station.’ ”
“ Telegraph to whom, and about what, Mary ? "
“ We must let Mr. Arthur know what he is to do with
that letter, my lady ; otherwise, he may endeavour to for-
ward it to the person to whom it is addressed.”
“ Very true, dear Mary. I do believe that my wits
are leaving me. By all means telegraph ‘Bum it.’ I
wish I could repay you for your prudent thought, as

easily as I can recompense Mrs. Rudd for her corn-
plaisance.”
“ Do not think of repaying me, my dear," replied the
waiting-maid fondly. “ It is a heartfelt pleasure to find
that I am not altogether useless in this strait. I am
yours—yours—yours—my beloved mistress, and will be
though every friend on earth should stand afar off, and
you were forsaken by your very kith and kin."
“ But God forbid that should ever be the case, Mary ! ”
ejaculated Lady Lisgard solemnly.

AN UNCHEERFUL PICNIC-
'W the time Lady Lisgard returned to the Abbey,
'\ nothwnhstandmg that the sleek bays had
‘3 Al devoured the road with all the haste of which
their condition permitted, it was long past the
breakfast-hour, and her absence from that meal provoked
no little comment from the members of her family. No-
body was able to allay their curiosity as to what could
have taken mamma to Dalwynch, but Miss Aynton did
her best to stimulate it.
“She has gone upon Mary Forest's account," said she
—-“ that is all I can tell you. I never knew anyone
take such trouble about her maids as dear Lady
Lisgard.”
“Yes, Rose,” replied Letty warmly; “but it is not
every maid who has lived with her mistress thirty years.
I believe Mary would lay down her very life for dear
mamma, and indeed for any of us. Whenever I read
those stupid letters in the papers about there being no
good old servants to' be seen nowadays, I long to send
the editor a list of our people at the Abbey. Mary,
.indeed, is quite a new acquisition in comparison with
Wiggins and the gardener; but then she is almost fault-
. less. I have heard mamma say that there has never been
a word between them.”
“Not between them, indeed, Letty,” returned Miss

Aynton laughing; “for Mistress Forest has all the talk
to herself.”
Sir Richard smiled grimly, for Mary had been in his
bad books ever since her attachment to “that vagabond
Derrick.”
“Good, Miss Rosel" cried Walter—“very good. I
wish I could say as much for this somlled new-laid egg.
Why should eggs be of different degrees of freshness?
Why not all fresh? Why are they ever permitted to
accumulate P "
“My egg is very good,” observed Sir Richard sen-
tentiously; “how is yours, Miss Aynton?" and he laid
an emphasis upon the name, in tacit reproof to his
brother for having been so familiar as to say “ Miss
Rose.”
“Well, Sir Richard, I am London-bred, you know,
and therefore your country eggs, by comparison, are
excellent.”
“I wish I could think,” said the baronet with stateli-
ness, “that in other matters we equally gained by contrast
with town, in your opinion."
“I believe London is the place to get everything
good,” remarked Walter sharply.
“We are going to-day, Miss Aynton,” continued the
baronet, without noticing the interruption, “to offer you
something which really cannot be got in town, and
which hitherto the state of the weather has forbidden
even here ”
“Ah, for shame, Richard l” interrupted Letty, holding
up her hands. “Now, that was to be a surprise for Rose.
—-It’s a picnic, my dear. I dare say you scarcely know
what that is.”
“I can tell you, then,” ejaculated Walter with acidity :
“it’s packing up all the things you would have in the
ordinary course at luncheon in a comfortable manner-
except the bread, or something equally necessary, which
is always left behind—and carrying them about six
miles to the top of an unprotected hill—in this particular

case, to a tower without a roof to it—there to be eaten
without tables or chairs, and in positions the most likely
to produce indigestion that the human body can adapt
itself to.”
“ I have always been told that being in a bad humour
is the most certain thing to cause what you eat to dis-
agree with you,” observed Letty demurely. — “Never
mind what Walter says. I am sure you will be delighted,
‘ dear Rose ; we are going to Belcomb, a sort of shooting-
box belonging to us, about ﬁve miles away, and built by
grandpapa."
_“ Commonly termed ‘ Lisgard’s folly,” added Master
\Valtcr.
“Not by his descendants, however, I should hope,
with one exception," observed Sir Richard, haughtily.
-—“ I will thank you, Walter, not to cut my news-
paper."
Master Walter had seized the paper-knife as though it
had been a more deadly weapon, and was engaged in
disembowelling one of a multiplicity of newspapers which
had just arrived by post.
“ I did not see it was yours,” returned he. “ Goodness
knows, nobody wants to read the Court journal but
yourself. The idea of not liking one’s newspapers cut ! ”
“Yes, I must say, my dear Richard,” said Letty, play-
fully patting her elder brother, next to whom she sat, upon
the shoulder, “ that is a most singular objection of yours.
I think it certainly proves that you will always remain an
Old bachelor.”
Sir Richard maintained a frowning silence. Master
Walter twirled his silken moustache, and looked up at
Miss Aynton with a meaning smile.
“What is your opinion upon the subject,” said he,
“ Miss Rose P ”
“Insolent l " exclaimed Sir Richard, rising so hastily
that he knocked over the chair on which he had been
sitting. “How dare you ask such questions in my
presence? "

“Richard, Richardl” cried a reproving voice ; and
10! at the open door stood my lady, hollow-eyed and
pale, and with such a wean'ness and melancholy in her
tones as would have touched most hearts. “Am I ever
to ﬁnd you and Walter quarrelling thus? Yes, I have
heard all, and think you both to blame ; but nothing can
excuse this violence. If I have any authority in this
house at all, not another word, I beg.”
Sir Richard bit his lip, but resumed his seat; Walter
went on quietly dissecting the Illuslra/m' London News,
with an air of intense interest; Miss Aynton very ac-
curately traced the pattern of her plate with her fork;
Letty, the innocent cause of the outbreak, shed silent
tears. Altogether, the family picture was gloomy, and
the situation embarrassing. My lady reaped this ad-
vantage, however, that nobody asked her a word about
her expedition to Dalwynch.
“ Do not let me detain you at table, my dear Letty,"
said she, breaking a solemn pause. “ Miss Aynton was
so good as to make my coffee this morning, and therefore
it is only fair that she should perform the same kind
ofﬁce now.”
Glad enough of this excuse to leave the room—a move-
ment felt by all to be very difﬁcult of imitation—Letty
rushed up stairs to indulge in a good cry in her own
bed-room, “the upper system of fountains " only having
been yet in play. Sir Richard gloomily stalked away
towards the stables; Walter lounged into the hall, lit a
cigar, and paced to and fro upon the terrace beneath the
windows of the breakfast-room, with both his hands in
his pockets. Whiﬁs of his Havana, and scraps of the
opera tune which he was humming, came in at the open
window, to those who yet remained. My lady had much
too good taste to dislike the smell of good tobacco, and
the air which he had chosen was a favourite one with
her ; perhaps Master Walter hummed it upon that
account. He was to leave the Abbey next day to join his
regiment—although not immediately.

It was only natural he should wish to spend a few days
in London after he had had so much of the quiet of Mirk,
and yet my lady grudged them.
How pleasant everything about him was 3 how dull the
Abbey would be without him; what a sad pity it was that
he and Sir Richard got on so ill. If she were to die,
would they not turn their backs on one another for ever,
and be brothers no more ? and if something worse than
death were to happen to her N 0, she would not
think of that. Had not all that could be done to avert
such utter ruin been done that very morning? There
was surely no immediate peril now—no necessity for such
excessive caution and self-restraint as she had been
obliged of late months to exercise; it was something to
have breathing-space and liberty.
“I hope you are coming with us to the picnic, Lady
Lisgard, now that that horrid man has gone P ” said a cold
quiet voice.
My lady, looking out of the window at her favourite
son, and lost in gloomy depths of thought, had entirely
forgotten that she had invited Miss Rose Aynton to bear
her company.
She did not venture to look upon her questioner’s
face, though she felt that it was ﬁxed on hers, reading
Heaven knew what. -
.How had she dared to think of liberty with this do-
mestic spy under her very roof ! What should she answer
to this dreadful question ? Something this girl must
know, or must suspect, or she would never have ventured
thus to allude a second time to the man Derrick, after
her rebuﬁ" in the morning. Above all things, she would
follow Mistress Forest’s advice, and get Miss Aynton out
of Mirk Abbey. She had intended to speak to her
respecting what had just occurred at the breakfast-table 3
that would also offer an opportunity to say something
more.

pedition, partly, that I wished to speak with you. I was
about to ask you to be very careful in your conduct
towards my sons this day. It is the last time they will be
together for weeks, perhaps. Be kind to my poor
Richard. Of course, Walter knew nothing of what has
passed between you and his brother; but the bow which
he drew at a venture sent home a barbed shot.”
Miss Aynton bowed her head.
“ You were sorry for that, Rose, I know. You cannot
fail to see how irritable he has lately grown, poor fellow.
The fact is, he has overestimated the strength of his own
powers of self-restraint. Your presence is a perpetual
trial to him.”
My lady paused, anticipating some reply to a hint so
palpable ; but Miss Aynton, who carried her fancy-work
in her pocket, continued to develop a pansy in ﬂoss silk;
and the flower opened in silence.
“Under these circumstances, dear Rose,” pursued my
lady, “ do you not think it would be better—I know how
embarrassing it would be to you to propose it, and there-
fore, although your hostess, I relieve you of the task—do
you not think it would, on the whole, be wiser for you to
leave us a little sooner than you had intended P”
The humming of the opera tune, and the odour of the
Havana, were growing more distinct, and the elastic
footfall on the gravel was coming very near.
“ If I consulted. my own feelings,” returned Miss
Aynton, in ﬁrm, clear tones, “ I should certainly have
left Mirk before this, Lady Lisgard.”
“Hush, Miss Aynton, for Heaven’s sake!” cried my
lady, “the window is open.”
“But unless Sir Richard himself,” pursued the girl in
more subdued accents, “releases me from my promise to
remain until after his birthday, I must, with your per-
mission, Madam, do so ; otherwise, he might possibly
imagine that his presence is too great a trial for me, and I
should be loath indeed to have my departure so mis-
construed."

There was bitterness in the tone with which she spoke,
but determination too. .
“ I am to understand, then," returned my lady, ﬂushing,
“that contrary to my advice and wish ”
“Mother, dear, here comes the break," cried Master
Walter, from the terrace beneath, in his ringing cheerful
tones. “ I hope you have told Roberts about the
prog.”
“Yes, dear, yes,” answered my lady, lovingly even in
her haste; then turning to the young girl, she whispered
almost ﬁercely: “At least, Miss Aynton, you will shape
your behaviour this afternoon as I requested. There is
no time n0w to discuss the other matter. And indeed
the butler entered the next moment with : “The break is
at the door, my lady.”
Now, the break was a very roomy vehicle, with ac-
commodation within it for three times the party who were
now about to occupy it, besides two seats at the back,
like ﬂying buttresses, for footmen. Yet Sir Richard
chose to sit upon the box beside the driver, a place only
selected (unless for smoking purposes) by persons with
“horsey” characteristics, who prefer coachman’s talk to
that of their equals, and among whom the baronet could
not be justly classed; but the fact was, the young man
was in an evil temper, and desired no companionship but
his own. He would have seen the whole expedition at
the bottom of the sea—a metaphor open to the gravest
objections, but which he used while arguing the matter
with himself aloud—if it were not that that fellow Walter
was going—and—and—he was not going to let lu'm have
all the talk to himself, that was all. True, Sir Richard
had given up the idea of transforming Miss Aynton into
Lady Lisgard ; but still it was not pleasant to see another
man making himself exclusively agreeable to her. He
was annoyed with himself at having exhibited such
passion at the breakfast-table, for the more he thought of
it, the more he felt convinced that Walter’s remark, al-
though doubtless intended to be Offensive, had not been

made with any knowledge of his own rejected suit. Still,
he was in a very bad temper, and listened to the conver-
sation going on behind his back with a moody brow, and
every now and then a parting of the lips, through which
escaped something the reverse of aprayer.
It was Walter, of course, who was talking.
“ Inhabited ! ” said he, in answer to some question of
Miss Aynton's. “ Oh dear, no. Belcomb never had a
tenant but once, and I should think would never have
another. One Sir Heron Grant and his brother took it
two years for the shooting-season : a brace of Scotchmen
whose ancestors dated from the Deluge, but so dreary a
couple, that one wished that the family had started from
a still earlier epoch, and been all washed away."
“I thought Richard rather liked Sir Heron,” observed
Letty simply.
“Yes, because he was a baronet ; and birds of the
same gorgeous plumage ﬂock together, you know. There
was nothing remarkable about him but his feathers, and
he scarcely ever opened his mouth except to put food in
it. It is said that in the old stage-coach times, he and
his brother travelled from Edinburgh to London, and only
uttered one sentence apiece. At York, the younger
brother saw a rat come out of a wheat-rick. ‘ By Iove,’
cried he, ‘there’s a rat!’ The next morning, and after
an interval of about eighty miles, Sir Heron replied : ‘Ay,
if Towser had seen that rat, he would have made short
work of him.’ ” -
“Well, it appears they agreed, at all events,” returned
Rose, coldly. “ After all even a foolish remark is better
than an ill-natured one." .
“The scenery is getting well worth your attention
here,” observed Sir Richard, turning graciously round
towards Miss Aynton. “ Belcomb is a complete solitude,
but for those who are contented with the pleasures of the
country, it is a pleasant spot enough."
“ Can we see the house from here, Sir Richard P”
“ No, not until we reach this windmill, on the top of

the hill. The private road branches out from the highway
at that spot ; and the mill is the nearest inhabited house
to Belcomb.-—-By-the-bye, mother, Hathaway must be
spoken to about those sails of his—there, you saw how
even old Jenny started at them—it is positivt iy
dangerous for horses to pass by. He must build up that
old wall a foot higher, and put a gate up. Any stray
cattle might wander in and get knocked down—the sails
are so close to the ground.” _
Master Walter had not at all relished Miss Aynton’s
rejoinder to his story ; still less had he liked his brother's
striking into the conversation ; least of all did he approve
of this landlord talk about repairs and alterations, which
reminded him of his being a younger son, and having
neither part nor lot in the great Lisgard heritage.
“There’s the Folly," cried he, suddenly, with a view of
changing the subject ; “upon that cliff-like hill yonder,
above that belt of trees.”
“ What, that beautiful ivied tower ! ” exclaimed Rose.
“ Yes ; without a roof to it.”
“ Well, at all events, it’s very pretty,” said Miss Aynton
reprovingly. “I am sure, Mr. Walter, you ought to be
grateful to your grandpapa for building so picturesque an
ediﬁce."
“ He might have made a road, however, to it,” observed
Walter satirically; “a road and a roof, I do consider to
be indispensable.”
“There’s abeautiful winding path through the wood,
Rose,” said Letty, “ ﬁfty times better than any road; and
is not the piece of water charming? It is the only one
with any pretension to be called a. lake in all the
county.”
Certainly Belcomb deserved praise. A small but com-
fortably furnished house, embosomed in trees, through
which were the pleasantest peeps of hill and dale, and
spread before it quite a crystal tam, with rocky islands so
picturesquer grouped that they almost gave the notion of
being artiﬁcial. It was as though a segment of the Lake-

country had been cut off, and inserted into the very midst
of Wheatshire.
It was as lonely, too, to all appearance, as any Cumber-
land mere. An old man and his wife, who were in
charge of the place, came hirpling out with respectful
welcomes, and the latter was about to remove the shutters
of the drawing-room, when my lady interposed.
“N 0, Rachel 3 we will not trouble you to do that. We
are going to picnic at the Tower. You seem quite sur-
prised to see us so early. I suppose nobody has been here
yet upon the same errand."
“Well, no, Ma’am ; nor is it likely, after your
orders "
“Oh, the fact is, mother,” interrupted Sir Richard with
a. little stammer, “ I forgot to tell you about it ; but Rinkel
informs me there has been considerable damage done by
parties coming here from Dalwynch and other places, and
therefore he has put up a notice to prohibit the whole
thing in future.”
And, indeed, upon the path leading to “the Folly,"
which could be approached by another way than that in
front of the house, they presently came upon a board
recently erected, which threatened trespassers With all
the rigour of the law.
There was a bitter sneer upon Captain Lisgard’s hand-
some face, at this assumption of authority upon the part
of his brother, and it did not soften when my lady
thoughtfully remarked: “ Ah, well ; that will certainly
make the place very private."
A curious reply, as Letty thought, at the time, for her
mother to make, who was always so eager to oblige her
neighbours, and who well knew how popular Lisgard’s
Folly was with the humbler class of townsfolk in the
summer months. But she was destined to be vastly more
astonished before that day was spent.
The little party, so strangely out of accord with one
another, took their lunch, indeed, beneath the shadow of
the Tower; but all those harmonious elements which are

so absolutely essential to the success of a picnic were
wanting. There were no high spirits, no good-humoured
badinage, and not the ghost of a laugh. My lady,
singularly silent even for her, gazed around her on the
familiar landscape, or regarded the shuttered cottage with
a mournful interest, as though they reminded her of
happier times. Miss Aynton, careful of what my lady
had enjoined, was studiously urbane to Sir Richard, but
without obtaining the wished-for result ; for while the
baronet was thereby only rendered tolerably gracious, the
captain grew intensely irritated. Poor Letty, who was
the only one prepared to be agreeable, or had any ex-
pectation of enjoying herself, feltimmensely relieved when
the repast was concluded, and the horses were ordered to
be “put to.” As for strolling about the grounds, and
pointing out their varied beauties to Rose, as she had ‘
counted upon doing, that was no longer to be thought of.
Sir Richard, as usual, offered his arm in stately fashion to
his mother; but Master Walter, lighting a cigar, stood for
a few minutes looking down with knitted brow upon the
lake, then sauntered after them, without saying a word,
and with both hands in his pockets.
“ Dear Rose,” cried Letty, who watched these pro-
ceedings with little short of terror, “ what have you said
to make Walter so cross 1’ I never saw him behave like
that in my life. He did not even look at you. Would it
be very wrong if you just ran after him, and said a word
or two before we got into the carriage? I am so dread-
fully afraid of a quarrel between him and Richard.”
“Just as you please, Letty," returned Miss Aynton,
looking pale, and a little frightened, too; and forcing a
laugh, she tripped down the zigzag path in pursuit of the
exasperated captain.
Letty waited a reasonable time, watching the footman
collect the debris of the entertainment, and pack the
plate,-and then, supposing their diﬁiculty had been ad-
justed, followed upon the track of her friend and Walter.
The path was not only of a considerable length, but so

very steep, that one little zigzag overhung another; thus,
as she descended, she perceived through the thin spring
foliage the two young people standing beneath her,
although they were quite unconscious of her approach.
She caught the last words of something Rose was saying;
those were, “Walter, dear." She marked the girl stretch
her arms towards him, as though she would have clasped
them round his neck ; and then she saw Captain Lisgard,-
of her Majesty’s Light Dragoons, put her roughly by,
shake himself free of her with a movement expressive
almost of loathing, and turn upon his heels with an
oath.

is thronged with men. The streets are per-
ceptibly more thronged with well-dressed males
than at any other time of the year. The May
meetings brought enough of parsons and sober-coated
laity to dull the living tide—to almost make us Londoners
a mournful people (which we are, naturally, not, despite
what Frenchmen say) ; but those grave ones have either
departed from us, or are now lost and undistinguishable
in this inﬂux of gay company. All the new-comers are in
their most gorgeous raiment, for is not this the great
“gaudy” week of the wicked? Half the ofﬁcers of cavalry
in her Majesty’s serviCe have obtained leave of absence
for eight-and-forty hours upon urgent private aﬁhirs;
and a fourth of the infantry have done the like; they
have come up from every station within the four seas to
see the great race run, which is to put in their pockets
from ﬁve pounds to ﬁfty thousand. Over their little
books they shake their shining heads, and stroke their
tawny moustaches in a deprecating manner, but each one
has a secret expectation that “he shall pull it off this
once ;” for, upon the whole, our military friends have
not been fortunate in turf transactions. There is a fair

sprinkling, too, of respectable country gentlemen, who
rarely leave their family to occupy their old~bachelor
quarters at Long’: or the ﬁzz/[stock except on this supreme
occasion. Every fast university-man who can obtain an
exeaf upon any pretence whatever — from sudden
mortality in the domestic circle down to being subpaz/zacd
by a friendly attorney in the suppositious case of
Hookey (a blind man) 11. Walker—is up in town re-
splendent, conﬁdent, young. Every sporting farmer,
save those in the north, who have a private saturnalia of
their own in the mid-autumn, has left his farm for two
nights and a day, and is seeing life in London. Besides
these, an innumerable host of well-dressed scoundrels—
for whom the word “Welcher” is altogether too com-
mendable~—have come up from country quarters, where
they have been playing various “little games,” all more
or less discreditable, to work together for evil with their
metropolitan confréra for four days.
Every haunt of dissipation is holding highest holiday.
The stupid, obscene Cider Cellars ﬁnd, for one night at
least, that they have attractions still ,- the music-halls are
tropical with heat and rankest human vegetation ;
Cremorne, after the crowded theatres have disgorged their
steaming crowds, is like a fair. The strangers' room at
all the clubs has been bespoken this night for weeks. In
the card-rooms, the smoking-rooms, the billiard-rooms,
there is scarcely space to move, far less to breathe in ,' yet
there is everywhere a babblement of tongues, and the
words that are most bandied about from feverish mouth to
month, are ﬁrst, 771: King, and secondly, Mnelaur. The
tout had kept his word—either from fear or nicest honour

news of the trial-race began to circulate: from its out-
siders’ place, to that of fourth favourite, then of third, and
at last to that of second had “the French horse ”
gradually risen. A curious and illogical position enough
——but then the turf-people are illogical—for if the news
that he had beaten He King was true, he ought to have

been ﬁrst favourite ; and if the news was no! true, he had
no reason to ﬁnd favour at all. As it was, however, T/zc
King had come down half a point as if to meet him, to
9 to 2 ; while [lime/ans stood at 5 to I.
And had that trial-race really taken place or not? and
if so, was it on the square P was the question which was
just then agitating the Houses of Lords and Commons
(nay, it was whispered, Marlborough House itself), and
all the mess-tables in her Majesty’s service, more than
any other subject in this world. There was also a vague
rumour that the favourite’s “understandings” were not
as they should be ; that there was a contraction that
might be fatal to his prospects ; that the idol’s feet were
of clay. Ralph Derrick had “put the pot on " his Many
Laws, and would be a millionaire if he won ; but Walter
Lisgard had put more than the pot. If the French
colours did not show in front at the winning-post, the
captain, still to use the elegant metaphor of the sporting
fraternity, would be in queer street. So infatuated had the
young man grown, that he had absolutely hedged even
that one bet which insured him a thousand pounds in case
He King should win the race. Notwithstanding his
coyness in accepting the ﬁrst offer of a loan from his un
cultivated friend, he had borrowed of him twice since, in
each case giving his I.O.U., whereby he endeavoured to
persuade himself that he was liquidating all obligation;
yet, unless he considered his mere autograph was worth
the sums for which it was pledged, I know not how he
succeeded in this. For if Mention: did not happen to win,
he not only would not have enough to discharge his debts
of honour for nearly two years—when he would come
into possession of his patrimony of ﬁve thousand pounds
——but evena great portion of t/zat would be bespoken.
Thus, of course, he had placed himself, through mere
greed, in a most unpleasant position; but at the same
time it must be allowed that he had yielded to a great
temptation, such as would probably have made the mouth

particular line ; for with the exception of mere outsiders,
The King had beaten every horse that was to contend
with him on the morrow ; and Almdaus, to Walter’s
certain knowledge, had beaten 77w King.
Equiner speaking, then, it was a certainty that the
French horse should win the Derby, in which case the
young man’s gains would be prodigious; for not only had
be taken advantage of the original position of the animal
in the betting, but as the odds grew less and less, had still
backed him, until his possible winnings reached, on paper,
to ﬁve ﬁgures ; on the other hand, by this last piece of
imprudence, his possible But no, it was not possible.
“ Things surely wouldn’t go so devilish cross with a
fellow as that;” or to put the captain’s thought in other
words, the Government of the Universe being founded
upon just principles, would never permit such a stupend-
ous misfortune to overwhelm him; or, it might be, the
gallant captain believed that Fortune was indeed a female,
and would therefore hesitate to inﬂict calamity upon so
pretty a fellow as himself. At the same time, the event
of the morrow was so big with fate, that it was not
pleasant to dwell upon it ; and anything which could
have prevented his mind from recurring to the same,
would have been welcomed gladly. But there was but
one thing that had the power to do this. His anxiety was
far too deep to be ﬂattered away by the smile of beauty,
or lost in the sparkle of wine. The homoeopathic 'treat-
ment, similia .rimilibus, he felt was the only one that could
now give him relief, and he therefore sought for rest from
the cares of the race-course in the excitement of the
gaming-table. Do not, however, let it be supposed that
the captain sought out any of those convenient establish-
ments for the immediate transfer of property, which are
guarded by iron doors, and always liable to the incursions
of the police, who, upon breaking in, discover four-and-
twenty gentlemen (one of whom has swallowed the dice),
sitting round a green baize table in conversation about
music and the Fine Arts. Mater Walter was rash in his

speculations, but he was not madman enough to play
chicken-hazard against foxes.
“I think I shall try my luck with the Landrails to-
night," observed he to his companion Derrick, stopping
short in ﬂaring Piccadilly, and biting his nails. The two
men had been occupying lodgings in the same house, the
Turf [fatal being full,- the younger ﬁnding a species of
comfort in the society of the part-owner of Al'wwhuzs, who
was even more conﬁdent of the success of that noble
quadruped than himself.
“ By all means, my lad," returned the gold-finder
simply, “although I don’t know what they are,- and so
as you take me with you, I don’t care."
Three weeks ago, such a proposition would have
staggered the captain, or rather, he would have rejected
it point-blank. To be seen in public with his uncouth and
ﬂashily-attired friend, was at that time a considerable trial
to the fastidious light dragoon ; but the immense interest
which they had in common, had rendered the familiarity
of the once odious Orson at ﬁrst tolerable, and event-
ually welcome, and even necessary. He had taken him
with him into quite exclusive circles, and, except on one
occasion at 1/1: Rag, where Derrick, having drunk more
champagne than was good for him, had offered to ﬁght
Major I’ompus of the Fusiliers for all/at In: liked, nothing
unpleasant had taken place in consequence. Men ob-
served : “ What a deuced rum fellow Lisgard brought
with him the other night ; " but the said stranger had lost
his money very good-naturedly at the whist-table, and i:
was understood that he had more to lose. Under such
circumstances, the gentlemen-players were very charitable.
Mr. Ralph Derrick did not play a ﬁrst-rate game at whist ;
very few persons who have not been brought up in good
society do ,' but his performance was not so inferior as to
make success impossible for a night or two, however cer-
tain the ruin that would have overtaken him in the long-
run. Moreover, he was never “put off his head ” by the
largeness of the stake, his habitual lavishness in money

matters rendering him indilIerent to that matter. Captain
Lisgard, on the other hand, though an excellent player,
considering his tender years, was liable to have his nerves
disorganised at any crisis of a rubber upon which an un-
usual amount depended.
“Yes,” repeated Master Walter, “I’ll try my luck at
the Landraz'lr, and you shall come, too, Ralph. Any
member has a right to introduce whom he likes.”
“Even a miner from Cariboo—eh, Master Walter,
provided he’s got money in his pocket? Well, I’m their
man, whether it’s for whist or all-fours."
“ Allfours/ ” repeated the captain with irritation.
“Who ever heard of a gentleman playing at that game?
Do, pray, be particular in what you say to-night. What-
ever you do, call a knave a knave, and not a fade. The
Lam/rail: is a very select place, Ralph, where men who
like to play their whist more quietly than at tile Rag look
in for an hour or two rather late.”
“Heavier stakes, I suppose?” observed Derrick
bluntly.
“ Yes, rather. You see, there’s always some row with
the committee, if play gets beyond a certain height at the
regular clubs. Now, this is a sort of friendly circle where
the points are quite optional, and the bets too. Yes, I
think I shall try my luck for a pony or two.”
“ I don’t think you look quite ﬁt for whist, my lad, to-
night,” returned Derrick, gazing gravely into the young
man’s haggard face. “ T o-morrow will be a trying
day, remember; I think you had much better get to
bed."
“ I couldn’t do it, man 1” replied Walter vehemently—
“ I dare not. I should never sleep a wink, and perhaps
go mad with thinking before the morning. Look here,
how my hand trembles. I have not nerves of iron, like
on." I
y “Poor lad, poor lad l ” ejaculated the other with affec-
tionate compassion. Nothing, as you say, ever makes
me tremble—except D. T. Ah, Heaven, but that is

terrible! Never drink, lad, never drink ; " and something
like a shudder throbbed through the speaker’s brawny
frame.
“The Landrails meet here,” said Walter, stopping at
the door of a private house in the neighbourhood of St.
James’s Palace ; “it is past eleven, and I dare say play
has begun.”
“ Who owns this house?” asked Derrick carelessly,
surveying the unpretending tenement in question—“ or
rather, who pays the rent?"
“Well, I hope we shall, Ralph, this evening. The fact
is, the hire of the rooms, the attendance, and even the
cost of the refreshments, are all defrayed each night by
the winners in proportion to their gains. Money does
not change hands until the ensuing week, but the
secretary enters all accounts in his ledger, and sees that
they are duly squared. I am answerable for your liabili-
ties to-night, so do you be careful with the liquors."
As the youthful Mentor administered this wholesome
piece of advice to his senior, the door opened, and they
were admitted. It was a most respectable house, neither
very large nor very small, and neatly but inexpensively
furnished. The butler was a man who might have been
the body-servant of an evangelical bishop, and whose
conscience was troubled by the spiritual shortcomings of
his right reverend master. To come upon so grave and
sad a man upon the eve of the Derby Day, was quite a
homily in itself. Through the open door of the dining-
room could be seen a cold collation, at which men
dropped in from above stairs if they felt so disposed ; but
there were light refreshments in the drawing-room also,
and a great variety of pleasant drinks. The Landmin
were thirsty folks, and imbibed gallons of iced hock and
Seltzer water; but they had not, as a rule, good appetites.
There were three tables for whist, and one dedicated to
piquet or écarté. All these had massive candlesticks
screwed into their wood-work—perhaps only to pre-
vent their falling oﬁ‘; but it also put a stop to any

possible use of them as a weapon or missile, and I think
that contingency had been also taken into account. A '
candlestick comes uncommonly handy to the ﬁngers when
luck has gone pertinaciously against one, and the man
who has won all the money is personally hateful. Above
all things, it was important, in that quiet, friendly circle,
to repress all ebullition of temper, and to steer clear of
all disputes. Nobody, one would hope, who was in a
position to be admitted to that society, would stoop to
cheating; but a. little strap was inserted at the opposite
corners of each table for the convenience of marking the
score, wherein, when the counters were once placed, they
could not be accidentally removed by the elbow.‘
The spacious room—for it was a double drawing-room
—was by no means brilliantly lit up ; a couple of bare
wax candles stood upon the refreshment-table ; where,
by-the-bye, there was no attendant, each man helping him-
self at pleasure ; but the other four pair in the room had
shades over them, which dulled their radiance, although
it caused them to throw a very bright light upon the
tables themselves. When the new comers entered, which
they did quite unannounced, the sight struck one of
them at least as a very strange one: three shining isles of
light—for one whist-table was not in use—amid a sea of
gloom; ten thoughtful faces with a sort of halo round
them, and one or two sombre ones standing by like their
evil genii, and watching the play. There was not a sound
to be heard at ﬁrst, except the dull fall of the pieces of
pasteboard, but presently a hand being ﬁnished in their
neighbourhood, a. sort of hushed talk began about what
would have happened if somebody had under-played the
diamond.
“What are the points? " whispered Denick in his
companion’s ear.
4‘ Persons who are acquainted with the game of whist have informed
me, that it is sometimes better—in the case of holding two by honours,
for instance—to be at three than four.

“What are the points to-night, Beamish?” inquired
Walter of one of the four, a very unimpassioned-looking
young man, who replied with a most unpleasant and
ghastly smile—as though he had cut his throata little
too high up : “ Fives and ﬁfties, my gallant captain, with
the odds in ponies; so, being a younger son, I advise
you to go to some other table.”
“Never mind, I am going to make a good marriage,"
returned Walter coolly. Mr. Beamish had been a penni-
less government clerk until he wedded the widow of an
opulent builder with half a town for her jointure. “If
you are not full,” added the captain, “' I declare in here,
for myself and friend.”
All four looked up for an instant at the threatened
stranger ,- for your good player, intent on gain, de-
tests the introduction of an unknown hand. Somehow
or other, although the odds are two to one, “it’s always
his cursed luck to have him for a partner.” General Prim,
who had been a martinet in the Peninsula, and as
offensive to his fellow-creatures as less favourable circum-
stances had permitted ever since, gave a ferocious grin,
and shook his single scalp-lock of gray hair like a malig-
nant pantaloon. The Hon. Pink Hawthorne, attaché at
the court at Christiana, but absent from that lively capital
upon sick-leave, wrenched his fair moustache this way
and that, and frowned as gloomily as his foolish forehead
would permit. The dealer, a Mr. Roberts, an ancient
bencher of one of the Inns of Court, paused with the trump
card in his ﬁngers still unturned. “Does your friend
know what the Blue Peter means, Lisgard P ”
“ I've been a sailor half my life, Sir, and it's devilish
odd if I did not," retumed Ralph Derrick grimly.
“What the devil (lid the fellow mean ?” added he to
Walter as the game began, and all the four became at
once automatons.
“ It’s the new system of asking for trumps," answered
Walter peevishly. “The same thing that they called the
Pilot the other night. How ridiculous you have made

yourself. See, there’s another table up. Bless the man,
not there, that’s the piquet place."
Ralph had quietly seated himself next to Major
Piccalilli, of the Irregular Cavalry, Cayenne Station,
Upper India, and had already disturbed his marking-
cards, whereby that gallant ofﬁcer was reduced to the
verge of apoplexy with speechless rage.
“Stay, you shall stick to this one,” continued Walter
in a low voice; “that fellow Beamish is hateful to me—
and I will cut in yonder. There is not a muff-table in
the room—all these beggars play too well." With these
words, the captain hurried away; and as soon as the
rubber he had been watching was ﬁnished, Derrick was
admitted of the conclave, to the exclusion of General
Prim, who cursed that circumstance very audibly, and for
a man of his advanced years, with considerable emphasis
and vigour. Derrick fell as a partner to the lot of the
gentleman who had inquired as to his proﬁciency in the
art of asking for trumps.
“If you would only hold your cards a lit/[e more on
the table, I should be able to see them myself,” remarked
Mr. Roberts with severity.
“If they look over my hands, Sir,” returned Derrick
reassuringly, “ I will forgive ’em: that’s all.-—lf you won’t
take that old gentleman’s bets "—referrjng to the general,
who seemed extremely anxious to back,their adversaries
——“then I will ;” and he did it—and luck went with him.
There was nothing stronger than champagne to be got
at in that respectable place of business, so Ralph kept
his head, and won—a hundred and ﬁfty pounds or so.
Then, the table breaking up, he rose and stood over his
young friend, to see how the cards were going with him.
“Bad,” muttered Derrick to himself, as he watched
Walter running through his hand with eager haste, as a
woman ﬂirts her fan. His beautiful face was dark with
care, his eyes ﬂashed impatiently upon the man whose
turn it was to lead.
“Our odds are in ﬁfties, eh, Lisgard?” drawled his

right-hand adversary, Captain and Lieutenant Wobegon
of the Horse Guards’ azure.
“The same as before, I suppose,” returned the young
man haughtily.
Ralph gave a prolonged whistle. His young friend
had a treble up, and the others nothing, so that he must
be betting two hundred and ﬁfty pounds to one hundred ;
and “the same as before " too ! Within the next
minute, the cards were thrown down upon the table, and
the adversaries scored a treble likewise. “That’s been
my cursed luck, Ralph, all to-night!” cried the young
man with a little grating laugh. “Four by honours
against one every deal.”
“You must have been doing something devilish bad,
Lisgard,” observed the Guardsman.
“Yes, I have—playing," answered Walter bitterly.
“But no fellow [an play with sixes and sevens; it de-
moralises one so.”
“ All cards do, my grandmother says,” answered
Wobegon, who for a Guardsman was not without
humour. “She made me promise, when she paid my
debts, my ﬁrst Derby, that I would never back anything
again; and I never have, except my luck and bills."
Captain Lisgard had naturally a keen appreciation of
fun, but he did not vouchsafe a smile to the facetious
Guardsman, who himself joked like an undertaker, and
had never been known to laugh in his life. The fact was,
that nothing could just now commend itself to Master
Walter except winning back his money.
Reader, did you ever play for more than you can
afford? Pardon me the inquiry 3 there is no occasion to
be Pharisaical ; for it is even possible to do worse things
than that in your life : moreover, the question of what is
more than you can afford is such a large one, and affords
such opportunities for a nimble conscience to escape. I
remember in Lord Houghton’s sze of Kat/r, that that
gallant nobleman, in defending the poet from the charge
of dissipation and gambling, remarks that it all arose

from his having lost ten pounds upon a certain evening at
cards. Now, considering that the author of Hj-pm'an had
no income, nor any bank except his imagination to apply
to—and it was notorious that he could never put a cheque
even upon t/zal—I take his lordship to be a very chari-
table peer. Ten pounds must have been, for Keats, a
large sum. But, undoubtedly, the matter is one for a
man to decide for himself; the whole question is rela-
tive ; and if you are apt to lose your temper, then re-
member you play for more than you can afford, although
your stakes are but—penny stamps. Captain Walter
Lisgard had lost his temper and his money also. There
was a numbed sense of misfortune pervading him ; it
seemed to him as though he was predestinated to lose. I
am much mistaken if he had not a sort of humming
in his ears. One of the most religious men whom it has
been my fortune to meet, has informed me that, in his
unregenerate days, when he was a gambler and everything
else," he once prayer! to win at cards. v
“Then it strikes me,” said I, “in addition to your
other backslidings at the time you speak of, you were just
a triﬂe blasphemous.”
“ No, Sir," said he; “I think not. All that I
possessed in the world was depending upon the result of
a certain game at écarte. It I had lost it, I should have
been a beggar. If I won it, I resolutely resolved never
to touch a card again—never to run the risk of ex-
periencing a second time the mental agony I was then
undergoing. I am not'ashamed to confess, Sir, that in
such a strait I prayed to win, and I did win."
“ All I have to say, Sir,” replied I, “is this: that it
was uncommonly hard upon the other man.”
Good resolutions are indeed by no means uncommon
among tolerably young persons in positions of pecuniary
" “ Every sin, Sir, in the Decalogue, I am glad to say, have I committed"
—meaning that the present change in him was rendered thereby all the
more satisfactory—“ with the sole exception of murder."

peril, such as that of Captain Lisgard. They vow their
candles to this and that patron saint if they should but
escape shipwreck upon the green baize this once. Master
Walter’s bid was conﬁned to a few "dips," if one may
use so humble a metaphor, of which about ﬁfty went to
the pound, and even those were not offered in a penitent
spirit. He would never play whist with the Laudrail:
any more. He would never lay the long odds beyond
“couters"—a foolish word he and his set used for
sovereigns. He would never back himself at all when
playing with “that fool Pompus"—his present partner.
He would become, in short, exceedingly wise and
prudent, if he should only “pull off" this present rubber.
There was “life in the mussel ” yet. They were at
“three all " when Pompus led his knave, instead of his
ten, from ten, knave, king, and only got the trick when
he should have got the game.
“We shall never have another chance now,” sighed
Walter, as his left-hand adversary turned up the queen.
But privately he thought that fortune would not be quite
so cruel as all that came to; moreover, he had an
excellent hand. His ﬁngers trembled as he arranged the
long suit of clubs, headed by tierce major, and saw that
he had four trumps to bring them in with.
As the game went on, however, Pompus exhibited
his usual feebleness, and things began to look very
black indeed. In the third round of trumps, Master
Walter’s memory left him sudden as an extinguished
taper. It is sad to have to say it of so excellent a
player, but he recollected nothing whatever, except
that, if he lost that rubber, it would be an addition of
three hundred pounds to the sum he already owed
Captain Wobegon. It was his turn to play, and he was
third hand. He had the king and ten of trumps. The
ace had been played: ay, he remembered that after a
struggle, and the knave too. Yes, his left-hand adver-
sary had played the knave. Should he ﬁnesse his ten
or not? That was the question, upon the decision of

which depended some ﬁve hundred pounds. Whist
is not always a game of pleasure. Master Walter
ﬁnessed the ten. “Thousand devils!” cried Denick
with a. tremendous imprecation, “why, the queen was
fumed up on your left, lad: you have thrown away the
game.” And it was so. Walter Lisgard did not speak
a word; but having compared his note-book with that
of Captain Wobegon, retired into a little oﬁice out of
the back drawing-room, where the secretary of the
Landrail: entered the members’ somewhat complicated
little accounts with one another in a very business-like-
looking ledger. “You have had a bad night of it for
you, Sir," remarked this gentleman quietly; “ you
generally hold your own." -
“Yes. What is the cursed total P”
“ Eighteen hundred.”
“Ralph Derrick," said Walter Lisgard, as the two
walked up St. James’s Street towards their lodgings
for bath and breakfasts, but scarcely for bed, since the
morning was already far advanced—“ if any horse but
Mmelau: wins the race, I am a ruined man.”

CHAPTER XX.
MR. \VITHERS \VITHDRAWS HIMSELF.
_ if HEN Derrick and the captain met at the
breakfast-table upon that Derby morning, there
a ;. was a note for the latter waiting by his plate.
It had been brought over from the Turf
1%er with apologies, having been detained there by
mistake, “through everybody being so busy," for at
least a week. As he turned it moodily over without
opening it, Ralph saw that it had the Mirk postmark.
“You have a letter from home, I see, lad; lucky
do !”
§Yes, very lucky,” replied the young man cynically,
as he ran his eye over the contents; “worse than my
infernal luck of last night, and only less than the mis-
fortune I am looking for to-day is the news in this
letter."
“ How is that, lad P”
“Well, you will hear some day."—Here he took the
note, and slowly tore it lengthways into thin strips, and
then across, so that it lay in a hundred fragments.—
“But it‘s a secret, at least it was until a week ago, but
being in a woman’s hands, of course she let it slip g"
and Master Walter looked as near to “ugly” as it
was possible for his handsome face to go.
“I fancied your folks at home were unaware of your
having intended to be at the Turf 110/51, and rather
thought you were with your regiment like a good boy.”

The captain returned no answer; but Derrick, who
was in excellent spirits notwithstanding the anxieties of
the coming day, continued to address him in that healthy
and cheerful strain which is the most intolerable of all
manners to one who is melancholy, and what is worse, in
dread suspense. “Now, for my part, Walter, any letter
in a woman’s hand, as I think yours is—nay, you foolish
lad, if you hadn’t stuﬁ‘ed it into your breast pocket so
quickly, I protest I should have thought it had come from
your mother or your sister. Why, you don’t mean to say
that that pretty little gatekeeper down at Mirk writes
letters to handsome Master Walter ? ”
“ And why not P” asked the captain deﬁantly. “If it
had come from Mistress Forest, then, indeed, you might
have taken upon yourself to object, although I under-
stand that even there you have not yet obtained the
position of bridegroom-elect." ‘
“No,” returned Derrick drily. “I was about to say
that I should have welcomed any letter in a woman’s
hand, especially if it began ‘My dearest ”’
“What the devil do you mean by looking over my
letter? ” exclaimed Master Walter, starting up in a fury.
“Nothing,” answered the other, purple with laughter
and muﬂin ; “I never dreamed of such a thing. But
since you said it came from the gatekeeper’s daughter, I
thought I’d make a shot. The idea of my wanting to
read all the pretty things the little fool writes to a wicked
young dog like you ; it’s no fun to me to watch a moth at a
candle. But what aspoiled lad it is! Why, here I have
had no letter at all from Mirk, and yet I am content.
Silence gives consent, they say ,' and particularly in this
case, when I know nothing but your lady-mother prevents
Mary writing ‘My dearest Ralph ’ to me. Indeed, if she
wrote ‘ Dear Sir, I can have no more to do with you,’ it
would not have the smallest effect. What I have made
up my mind to do, generally comes to pass. Where
there’s a will—that is, supposing it is strong enough—
thcre is most times a may.”

“I know you’re a devil of a fellow,” sneered Master
Walter, rising and gazing out of window at the bustling
street already astir with the Derby vehicles ; “ but I am
afraid your will can’t win me this race.”
“ It's done a great deal towards it, Captain Lisgard.
It brought about the trial-race with the ‘ crack,’ although
my lord did give himself such cursed airs, and not only
let you in for a good thing, but lent you the money to
take advantage of it to the uttemiost."
“That’s true,” said Walter frankly, and holding out
his thin white hand. “I dare say you think me an
ungrateful beast, but I’m worried by a matter that you
know nothing of ; besides——”
“Not another word, lad—not another word; I am
a rude rough creature, and I said some unpleasant
things myself—Here is our hansom, and with light-
green curtains of gauze. I’m cursed if I go down to
Epsom with the colours of The King on my cab.
Why, the beggar must have done it to insult us."
“Stuff and nonsense, Ralph,- it’s only to keep oil
the dust. If you have no curtains, you must wear a
veil, that’s all. Look there, in yonder barouche and four,
every man has a green_ veil on. By Heaven! that Wo-
begon’s one of ’em. He’s got my I.O.U. for ﬁfteen
hundred pounds in his waistcoat-pocket ; and there’s that
ugly devil Beamish, too—Well,” muttered the captain
to himself, “ I’m glad I did’nt go with l/lat party, at all
events.”
Master Walter, who was as popular in town as else-
where, had been asked to take a seat for that day in half-
a-dozen “drags” and barouches, but he had preferred to
go alone with Derrick; not that he enjoyed his com-
panionship, but because, as I have before said, he
gathered some comfort from his society under the pre~
sent cloud of anxiety and apprehension.
“I say, Walter, you are a pretty fellow; you forgot
all about the provisions, but see here,” cried Derrick
triumphantly, pulling a hamper from under the sofa; “a

pigeon-pie, a fowl, two bottles of champagne, and one of
brandy!”
“What confounded nonsense l” returned the young
man peevishly. “There are dozens of parties who would
have given us lunch. The idea of a hamper on the top
of a hansom l "
“Well, come, you are wrong anyway, t/m'c, lad, for I
have seen a dozen going by this morning.”
“Very likely, and you have also seen plenty of vans,
each with a barrel of ale. However, it’s of no con-
sequence. If the Frenchman wins, I could eat peri-
winkles out of a hand-barrow with a hair-pin ; and if he
loses—why, then, I shall not have much appetite."
“ Look here, lad,” replied Derrick gravely, “this sort
of thing won’t do. Never be down on your luck, until,
at all events, your luck is down upon you. You are
not cut out for this work, 1 can see. A man ought
to be sanguine, yet cool ; hopeful of gain—yet quite
prepared for loss, who goes in for such a stake as you
have got upon to-day’s race. A gambler should be all
brain, and no heart, let me suggest, before we start, that
you should just take a little brandy.”
“ No, no ! ” ejaculated the captain impatiently. “ If I
am a funk, as you so delicately hint, I am not a fool.
Come, let's be off. The next time I see this room again,
I shall be a made man—or a beggar."
To any man, who risks by betting more than he can
conveniently spare, the going to the Derby is by no
means a cheerful expedition, whatever \his coming home
may chance to be ; and further, it may be observed, that
of all professional persons, those who take up the Turf as
their line in life, are the most sombre and unlively.
Many of them are clever fellows enough, and one or two
are honest men, but there is no such thing as fun among
them. The Ring would never take to the snowballing one
another, as the stockbrokers have been known to do
when ’Change was dull. They have only a certain grim
and cruel humour, such as the Yankees use, the point of

which lies always in overreaching one another. Derrick
was right when he said that Master Walter was not ﬁt for
such a calling, but the same thing might, almost with
equal force, have been said of himself. He was not, in-
deed, of an anxious disposition, but his temper, when
once roused, was almost demoniacal, and he could never
stand being cheated. Now, cheating, in some form or
other, is the soul of the Turf.
Whenever it is possible to trot in that vast procession
down to Epsom, the appearance of which is so gay, and
the pace so funereal, the large-wheeled hansom does it.
Many a pretentious four-in-hand did the captain and
Derrick pass, and many a wicked-looking brougham with
its high stepping steeds 3 and the occupants of each had
often a word to say about “the fellow with the beard that
Lisgard had picked up, and was carrying about with him
everywhere.” For the manly growth that fringed Ralph
Derrick’s chin was something portentous, even in these
days of beards, and his appearance was rendered still
more striking from the fact of his wearing an inﬁnite
number of wooden dolls in the band of his hat, where
Louis XI. used to stick the images of his patron saints.
In vain Walter had informed him that this was a weak-
ness only indulged in by snobs. Ralph rejoined (but not
without an extra tinge of red in his weather-beaten cheek),
that being a snob himself, it was therefore only natural
that he (Ralph) should take pleasure in thus adorning
himself. He had rather be a snob than a nob, by a
precious sight ; he knew that. As for making an
exhibition of himself, if that was really the case, it was
. only right that the public should be advertised of the
matter, so he purchased a penny trumpet, and executed
thereon the most discordant flourishes. “Say another
word, lad,” added he, with a cheerful malice, “and
blessed if I don’t buy a false nose !”
Walter made no further remonstrance ; he leaned back
in the hansom as far he could, and as much behind the
green gauze curtain, until they reached the course, when

his companion divested himself of the objectionable orna-
ments, and made a present of a live tortoise, which he
had also acquired on the way, to an importunate gipsy
woman, instead of crossing her palm as requested “with
a piece of silver." They could hear by this time the hum
and the roar of the great human sea which surged about
the railings in front of the Grand Stand, and in a few
minutes more they were within them. They pushed their
way through the babbling throng towards a certain corner
that had been agreed upon, and there was Mr. Tite
Chifney waiting for them, with a very pale face indeed.
“Nothing wrong with the horse, is there P " cried Ralph
in a loud and menacing voice, which'caused not a few
sharp eyes to glance cunnineg towards them, and set not
a few sharp ears to listen to what might come next.
“ No, Sir, nothing,” returned the trainer. “For
Heaven’s sake, speak low. I never saw him looking
better in my life. We will see him now, if you like."
“Where’s Blanquette?” continued Ralph, a little re-
assured by this, as they moved away towards the
paddock.
“ Mr. Blanquette is not here, Mr. Derrick." \
“Not here ? Why, he was to join you the day before
yesterday, otherwise I would have come myself.”
“ He has been here, Sir, but he's gone away again.”
“ What? Is he not coming back to-day? ”
“I hope so, Sir, I most sincerely hope so; but the
fact is—now take it quietly, for it’s none of my fault—
he’s gone after Jack Withers.”
In an instant, while Walter ejaculated a smothered cry
of agony and wrath, Derrick had seized the trainer
by the throat. “You know me, Sir," cried be. “As I
swore to treat that tout on the downs at Mirk, so wilLI
treat you, if that jockey—” -
But two blue-coated men had thrust themselves between
the strong man and his victim , a gentleman in a tight-
buttoned frock-coat was coming up, too, in plain clothes,
with that swift determined stride peculiar to members of

“the force," and the crowd grew very thick about them,
and a thousand eyes were being concentrated upon
Ralph’s furious face, he knew. If his temper was lost
now, he felt that all was lost. With an effort that almost
cost him a ﬁt of apoplexy—“ I am sorry,” said he, “ that
I laid my hand upon you, Mr. Chifney."
“That will do,” returned the trainer quietly, arranging
his neckeloth. “ Mr. Inspector, you know me, and there
is no occasion for your services.”
“All right, Mr. Chifney, but you have got a rummish
customer to deal with there,” replied the guardian of the
law, stroking his chin, and looking at Derrick, much as a
vice-president of the Zoological Society might regard a
novelty in wild beasts, that had been half-promised to the
establishment, and then withdrawn.
“ I have never been treated thus,” complained the
trainer, as the three moved away, and the gaping crowd
gathered round some other object of attraction, “and
have never deserved such treatment from any employer
of mine, although I have kept racing-stables these thirty
years. I can make some allowance for one who has so
much money on this horse, as I know you have, Mr.
Derrick, but I give you my .honour and word that I was
as astounded as Mr. Blanquette himself, when I heard
the news that Jack had skedaddled. He was your own
jockey, remember, not mine: no boy in my stables has
ever played such a scurvy trick as this."
“Have you any boy that can take this scoundrel’s
place ? " asked Captain Lisgard impatiently.
“ I have got as good riders as can be got, Master
Walter, upon so short a notice ; and Mans/aux shall have
the pick of them. But you know what a devil of a temper
the horse has; and this Withers was the only lad who
understood him.”
“ How comes it that Blanquette has gone to look for
him P " asked Derrick thoughtfully. “ Does he know
where he is likely to be found P”
“ Not as I know of, Sir,” returned the trainer gravely.

“He said he would bring him back dead or alive—those
were his words."
“Stop a moment, Chifney," ejaculated Ralph. “ I can
scarcely ﬁnd breath to utter even the suspicion of it ; and
the certainty would, I verily believe, choke me; but do
you think it possible that all is not quite on the square
with Blanquette himself? "
“Well, Mr. Derrick, I’d rather not say. Mr. Blanquette
is as much the owner of the horse as yourself. He’s my
employer too—and nobody ever heard T ite Chifney

“Thousand devils!” cried Derrick, stamping his foot
so that the print of it was left in the yielding turf 5 “ is this
a time for your senseless scruples? I ask you, do you
think it possible that this man—my pal for years, one that
has oftentimes faced death in my company, and once
shared the last seanty meal that stood between us and

than once.”

not have thanked me for interfering with your affairs. I
thought that you and Mr. Blanquette were one. Besides,

being nobbled. And since Lord Sto'nart has chosen to
withdraw his horses from my keeping—chiefly, by-the-bye,
through his disgust at that trial-race in which his crack
was beaten—I, of course, was no longer bound to 100k

after his interests ; no, indeed, quite the reverse," added
the trainer with an oﬂended air.
“Did this Frenchman say he would be here to-day, if
he did not ﬁnd the boy?” inquired Captain Lisgard
sharply, with an unpleasant look in his ﬁne eyes.
“I can answer that question for him,” returned the
gold-digger grimly. “ If he has played me false, he will
not only not be lzere; he will have put the sea—and not
the narrow one either—betweenhimself and Ralph Derrick;
for he knows me very well. But now ” here he drew
along breath, and made a motion with his mighty
arms as though he would dismiss that matter for the
present, tempting as it was to dwell upon—“ let us see
the boy that is to take this rascal’s place. We may
pull through still with luck." -

CHAPTER XXI.
AT EPSOM.
. - AVE you ever seen at the beginning of a great
law case a certain hush and stir among the
gentlemen of the long robe, and then a young
man rise—not much over forty, that is—and
inform “ my lud " that his unfortunate client was placed
at a sad disadvantage, for that, through the unexpected
but unavoidable absence of his leader, the whole case
must needs devolve upon his own (the junior’s) shoulders ?
The circumstance is of course most lamentable, but still
the young counsel (if he is worth a guinea fee) has a
certain conﬁdent radiance about him, for he feels that
his opportunity has come at last, and that he has but
“to grasp the skirts of happy chance,” to be borne
from that moment woolsackwards. So was it that Mr.
Samuel Hicks, horse-jockey unattached, when suddenly
called upon to ﬁll the vacant seat of Brother Withers,
absent without leave. To ride a Derby at a moment’s
notice was, to one in his position, almost what to take the
command of the Mediterranean squadron would be to a
young gentleman at the naval school. But not a trace
of indecision was visible on the young centaur’s coun-
tenance.
“I will do my best, gentlemen," said he modestly;
then added, with the irrepressible assurance of his class,
“and I think I know how to ride."

“You know nothing, and are an infernal young fool,”
returned the trainer sharply. “ You never were outside
of such a horse as {limelaur in your life. If he'is in a
good temper, a child might steer him; but if he jibs—
if he stands st0ck-still in that great race an hour hence,
as he is as like to do as not—what will you do then P ”
“ Bless my soul, Sir,” cried the boy, his golden future
—not without “ mother in a comfortable cottage, and easy
for life,” let us hope, in the foreground—all swept away
by this relentless prediction—“ Bless my soul, Sir, I think
I should cut his throat.”
“I like this fellow,” cried Derrick, slapping the lad
upon the back. “ Look you, here is twenty pounds,
which you may keep in any case, and you had better take
it now, for if you lose the race, there will be plenty of
folks to want all my money. But if you win, boy, I will
make it two hundred.”
“And I will make it four," added Master Walter fer-
vently. ‘
“ So, you see, you will be a made man for life,” remarked
the trainer kindly. “ But listen to me, Sam, or else all
this glitter will be the merest moonshine. Be sure never
touch your horse with whip or spur; for Withers, I have
noticed, never did. But if the beast jibs—I saw Jack do
this at the trial-race, and once before—snatch at his ear.
There may be some secret in the way of handling it,
but there is no time for ﬁnding that out. Do you
twist it hard.”
“Oh, Sir, I’ll twist it off, but he shall win,” returned
the jockey plaintively; and off he went to don his new
owner’s colours—black and red—as proudly as an ensign
to ,his ﬁrst battle-ﬁeld. .
It had got about that there was some hitch about
Marinas, and the odds were rising rapidly against him ;
and when the large and somewhat ungainly animal took
his preparatory canter in front of the stand under the
guidance of the uncelebrated Hicks, they rose still
higher. If any of his ancient conﬁdence had remained

to Captain Lisgard, he could scarcely have resisted the
tempting offers that were being roared out in harsh and
nasal tones from every quarter of the ring.
“ I'll lay 7 to 1 against Alan] Laws ” (for most of
the racing fraternity favoured Mr. Derrick’s pronuncia-
tion of that name). “I’ll lay 8 to' I.”
“ I’ll take 4 to r I name the winner” (for the relation
between The King and the French horse in the betting
was that of buckets in a well.)
“ I take odds that Mmelaur is not placed," exclaimed
a shrill and sneering voice close beside where the two
men most interested in that depreciated animal were
standing.
“What odds will you take, my lord? ” inquired Captain
Lisgard, biting his lip in wrath, for it was Lord Stonart
who was offering them, the man whose confidential agent
had been talking with Blanquette, and to whose machina-
tions it was almost certainly owing that Merle/am had lost
his rider.
“Ah, Lisgard, how are you P" returned he coolly.
“How came it that I missed you just now in the pad-
dock? Haven’t seen you since that morning on Mirk
Down. So we’re going to try that race over again, eh?"
“I think you were asking for odds, my lord, about the
black horse being placed 1? ” rejoined the captain, pale with
passion at the sarcasm that lurked in the other’s tone.
“Yes, so I was. There has something gone amiss,
they say, with him. I’ll take 4 to r in ﬁfties—hundreds,
if you like."
“ Don’t do it,” whispered Derrick eagerly. “ Don’t
you see what the scoundrel reckons upon P If the horse
runs straight, he will win the race, but if he jibs, he will
be nowhere. He is therefore taking odds where he ought
to give them.”
“You don’t take me, eh ?” continued his lordship.
“Well, I think your friend advises you wisely. See, the
horses are moving towards the hill. Like myself, you
have no stall, I conclude. Where are you going to place

yourself? I think I shall remain below here on the
green.”
“Then I shall see the race from the roof, my lord,"
answered the captain savagely, and thither he and his
companion betook themselves accordingly.
To look down from that elevation upon Epsom Downs
just before the start for the great race, is to behold a
wondrous spectacle. Men—a quarter of a million or so
—as black and thick as bees, and emitting much such a
hum and clangour as attends the swarming of those
perilous insects ; and the carriages, twelve deep—dwarfed
to much the same proportions as those chariots which
used to be dragged in public by the Industrious Fleas.
But raise your race-glass, and with a single sweep you
survey every social degree of human life ,- from the
duchess to the poor drunken hag on the look-out for
empty bottles; from the peer to the ragged thief who
bides his moment to snatch his booty from his lordship’s
carriage-seat. This rascal’s opportunity is coming. If
there are ﬁve minutes in an Englishman's life in which he
is indiﬂerent to the preservation of his property, it is
those ﬁve which are now at hand when that little jockey
rainbow yonder is gathering on the hill. Thirty of the
ﬂeetest horses in the world are about to contend for the
greatest prize that horse can win : it is not that circum-
stance, however, which makes so many hearts go pit-a-pat,
keeps all lips sealed, and rivets every eye, except that of
the pick-pocket and his natural enemy the policeman,
upon that shifting speck of colour. All are aware of the
enormous interests that hang upon the result impending,
even if they have none themselves ; vague but gigantic
shadows of loss and gain forecast themselves upon every
mind. In a few seconds more, certain unknown
‘ scoundrels—fellow-creatures, however, with whom we
have indissoluble sympathies—will be enriched beyond
the dreams of avarice; and certain other poor devils will
be ruined. A solemn hush pervades all Pandemonium.
The very organ-grinders cease their hateful discord; the

vendors of race-cards give their lungs brief respite; the
proprietors of All!!! Sal/its intermit their useless cry of
“ Three throws a penny," and stand on tiptoe, with their'
ﬁm'c: beneath their arms, as eager as my lord who totters
insecure erect upon the front seat of his drag. Nervous
folks see all these things because they cannot keep their
eyes ﬁxed where they would. A sudden roar breaks forth,
not in the least like human speech, but it means that they
are oﬁ" !
“ Are they off, Ralph P " inquires Master Walter of his
companion, “or is it a lie? " His small and well-gloved
hand is trembling so, that his race-glass gives him views
like a kaleidoscope. Splendour, or penury—nay, worse,
or shame await him, and are at the threshold. He knows
not yet the foot of which it is that draws so nigh : and he
dares not look forth to see.
“They are not off yet, lad,” returned Ralph ; and even
lie has to swallow something which appears to be
in his throat, but is not, before he can give that
assurance.
Master Walter draws a long breath, for this is a re-
prieve, and endeavours once more to ﬁx his eyes upon
the dancing horses ; but it is the retina of the mind only
which presents its image. He beholds his mother’s
face, paler and more careworn than ever, sharpened
with pain, through something which she has learned
smce
“They’re olf ! they’re off ! " is again the cry ,' and this
time the great plane of faces shifts and ﬂashes as it follows
the speck of colour now in rapid motion—at ﬁrst, a
double line, next a lengthening oval, and then a string of
brilliants, knotted here and there. As they approach
Tattenham Corner, Walter perceives, for the ﬁrst time,
that they are horses, and that three are leading all the
rest—Green, Black, and Yellow. The chances are then
but two to one against him. How they lag and crawl,
these vaunted coursers of the air? How long is this
frightful suspense to last? “The Yellow’s beat—111m;

is out of it—the Black wins—the favourite is beaten,
blast him ;—/l{cnelrzu: wins—--” There is a thunder
of hoofs, a ﬂash of Black and Green, then a. cry such as,
even on Epsom Downs, was never before heard. “By
Heaven, he’s off! The boy is killed! Was it short of
the post? What number’s up? The Green has won.
T/ze King, 2716 K'ing/ Hurrah, hurrah !" And so the
babblement breaks forth again, and the tumultuous crowd
ﬂows in like water upon the fair green course, save one
small space of it kept clear by men with staves, where
lies a poor whitefaced j0ckey, senseless and motionless,
for whose misfortune everybody is sorry, but especially
those who have backed the Black.
All had gone well with the French horse until within a
few strides of the winning-post 3 he was leading by
half a length, and his victory seemed certain to all eyes,
when suddenly—whether through the devilish nature of
the beast, or whether poor Sam had touched him with the
heel in that overwhelming crisis, can never now be known
—but he stopped stock-still, and shot his rider (snatching
at his car as he ﬂew by) a dozen yards, like cricket-ball
from catapult. The uncelebrated Hicks had actually pre-
ceded the rival jockey at the post, but left his horse be-
hind him ; and there the beast was standing yet, with his
fore-feet planted resolutely before him, and his untwisted
ears laid level with his neck, as though he was giving
“ a back " at leap-frog. '
“Come down, and let us get away from this, lad,”
broke forth Derrick impatiently; “it is no use waiting
here."
“It is no use waiting here,” echoed the young man
mechanically, as he followed his friend through the fast-
thinning crowd down to the basement story.
At the foot of the staircase they met Mr. Chifney, look-
ing very white and disconcerted. He, too, had put more
trust than he was wont to place in horses in .jl’lt'lll/l'ulf’
and had suffered in consequence; and the w11y trainer
was not used to losses.

“How is the boy? " inquired Derrick.
“Bad, Sir, bad: it is a. bad business altogether,”
muttered the man of horseﬁesh, not perhaps wholly think-
ing of the boy.
“It was not his fault, however,” continued Ralph.
“ No man could have kept his seat during such a devil’s
trick. Look you, let him have all he requires ; every-
thing. I will be responsible."
Mr. Chifney had expected from this stormy client some
terrible outbreak of wrath and disappointment; and lo,
he was all benevolence and charity! His astonishment
exhibited itself signiﬁcantly enough in his face; but Ralph
mistook the cause.
“Why do you stare so, Sir? I suppose I am good
for a few pounds yet. The horse is mine,- and I
apprehend will be security enough; though I wish I
could aﬁord to shoot him—cursed beast ! Where is Lord
Stonart?"
“Agreat personage has, I have heard, just sent for
him, to offer his congratulations.”
Ralph Derrick uttered a harsh and bitter laugh.
“ I suppose we couldn’t see this interesting interview,
eh?”
“Certainly not, Sir," replied the trainer hurriedly,
alarmed by Derrick’s tone and air. “I hope you are not
thinking of putting us all in the wrong by any act of
violence ? "
“Well, no ; I thought of conferring the honour of
knighthood upon his lordship with ahorsewhip—that’s
all."
“Take him away,” whispered the trainer to Master
Walter ; “for Heaven’s sake, take him home."
“Yes, home. Come home, Ralph," repeated the
young man, like one in a dream.
“ Ha, Lisgard, how goes it?" drawlerl Captain Wo-
begon, sauntering slowly up to where the three were
standing. “ I hope you recouped yourself for last night’s
misfortunes by T/te K711; just now. Devilish near thing,

though. The Frenchman did win by a head, but
luckily it was the boy’s, and not his own."
“I backed the wrong horse,” returned Master Walter
gloomily. “And I owe you—how much is it? ”
“A little over fourteen hundred. If it’s any con-
venience to you, I can wait a fortnight or so; I would
say longer—but Lurline—she was inquiring after you,
only yesterday, by-the~bye ; I felt quite jea10us—has a
soul above economy. And after the Derby, you know,
folks send in their bills; especially jewellers. They know
if they are not paid tile/z, it's a bad look-out. What a lot
that fellow Stonart must have netted I I’m sorry to see
you so down in the mouth 3 you used to be such a lucky
fellow.”
“Used to be such a lucky fellow,” mused Master
Walter, as he and his companion made their way to the
outskirts of the heath, where a place had been appointed
at which their hansom was to wait for them. “ Yes, so
I was. I used to win in a small way, and yet people
were always glad to see me. They won’t be so pleasant,
I reckon, when they ﬁnd that I am a defaulter. I can't
get at any money for a year, and who’ll wait a year with-
out making a row? Even if they do, mine will be a
ﬁne coming of age. How could I have been such a
frightful fool! "
“Tell your fortune, my pretty gentleman,” observed
a gipsy girl, laying her walnutcoloured ﬁngers upon
the young man’s coat-sleeve. “You are born under a
lucky star.”
“I may have been born there; but I have wandered
far away from its influence,” replied Master Walter,
shaking her hand off somewhat roughly. “If you want
a shilling, you shall have it; for I have nothing but
other people’s money about me, and that one always
parts with very readily. But don’t call me lucky, for
that’s a lie, you jade."
“ Bless your handsome face,” returned the gipsy
humbly, “it’s a. shame that it ever should be crossed

by the shadow of sorrow. You can’t be unlucky,
Sir, with eyes like yours—especially," added she, as
the two strode hastily away —- “especially among the
ladies."
“ Do you hear that, lad?" laughed Derrick en-
couragineg ; but the young man was too wrapt up in his
own sombre thoughts to heed such things.
“I must sell out," muttered he to himself; “ that’s the
ﬁrst thing. And I must run down to Mirk ; there is no
knowing what that spitﬁre there may do else."
“Here’s our hansom, and the fellow not drunk for a
wonder !” exclaimed Derrick. “Where's the horse,
man P "
“ In this next booth, Sir,” returned the driver. “I will
put him to in no time—I am afraid your honours have
not won.”
“See, Walter, lad,” cried Derrick in remonstrance;
“that’s your fault. Don’t hang out such signals of distress
that everybody who meets us oﬁ'ers their confounded
pity. Be a man, lad; be a man. Besides, what did
that gipsy girl say just now? Many awise word is spoken
in jest. She said, with your good looks, that you must
needs be lucky with the women. I should like to see
.the heiress who would say ‘No’ to Captain Walter
Lisgard. A good marriage would mend all this,
and "
“Go to the devil!” exclaimed the young man pas-
sionately.
“You are out of temper, lad,” returned the other
gravely ; “ but don't say those sort of things to me, for I
have not deserved them.”
“Not deserved them! you have been my ruin, curse
you !" continued the other with vehemence. “But for
you, you drunken "
“ Take you care, Walter Lisgard l" roared the bearded
man in a voice of thunder. “Do not make me strike
you, for I would as soon strike my son. How can all
this be my fault? Do you suppose that I have not lost

also—almost all I have in the world save a. few
hundreds?"
“ Ay, mine, I suppose," exclaimed Walter bitterly. “ I
know I owe you a thousand pounds.”
“ Yes," returned the other, producing his pocket-book,
“ here are three I.O.U.s hearing your signature, for two,
three, and ﬁve hundred pounds.”
“You shall be paid, Sir, never fear,” rejoined the
young man insolently. “No man but you, however,
would have produced them at such a time. But it serves
me right for herding with such people."
“Thank you, young man. At the same time, few of
your ﬁne gentlemen would treat them this way.” Thus
saying, he tore them into little strips, and scattered them
to the wind—“All I ask, by way of repayment, now
is, that you will listen to a few words I have to say.
I have loved you, Walter Lisgard, in spite of your-
self, and would have laid down my life for yours. I
have concealed from my own heart as well as I could
the selﬁsh baseness that underlies your every act—but
that is over now. Look you, on the coasts where I have
come from, there is many a bay which, if you saw it at
high tide, you would say: ‘What a beautiful harbour!
what smooth and smiling water ! This is a place for all
men to cast anchor.’ But when the tide is going out,
you see_how you have been deceived. Here is areef
that would wreck a navy; here is a jagged and cruel
rock, and there another and another. With every one,
you say to yourself, surely this is the last. But for this
and for that, there was never abetter anchorage; and
how beautiful the place is ! What luxuriant foliage—what
exquisite verdure fringes the shore —-just the shores, you
know. But when the tide is quite out it is impossible to
like the place any longer. There are nothing but reefs and
rocks to be seen then, and a few loathsome reptiles
among the slime. Now, Walter Lisgard, I have come
upon you at dead low-water, and I don't wish to meet
you any more. You will deceive others, of course, who

may see you at the ﬂow, but you will never deceive
me. I shall go down to Mirk, after a little, to bring
away my wife. Take my advice, and don't be there.
Above all things, see that your mother does not cross
me in that matter, or it will be worse for all concerned.
I have nobody now in the world who cares for me save
Mary Forest, and they shall not rob me of her. Here is
the hansom in which we can no longer sit together.
You are not used to walking, being what is called a
gentleman, so you had better take it. All I ask you is,
to leave our lodgings before I reach them, since you will
arrive there ﬁrst; or if not—I will take myself off else-
where ; I should be sorry to be under the same roof with
you again, young man." .
Then pulling his hat forward upon his brow, in place
of farewell, Ralph Derrick turned his back upon Walter
Lisgard, and took his way to town on foot. As the
captain, sitting alone in no very enviable frame of mind,
passed him afterwards upon the road, he could not help
remarking to himself how old and bowed the insolent
fellow looked.

observed my lady to her maid, as that
conﬁdential domestic was proceeding with
the duties—which were by no means mysteries—of her
toilet, upon the morning after the picnic at Belcomb.
“He is certain to reply concerning a matter which was
important enough to cause the use of the telegraph.”
. “I suppose so, my lady: very like.”
Nothing could be more in contrast than the tones in
which these two persons had spoken ; the question had
been earnest, almost fervent, and one which evidently
was put in order to evoke an afﬁrmative answer; the
reply was given carelessly enough, or rather as though
the thoughts of her who uttered it were absent from the
matter altogether.
“ ‘Vcry likely} Mary ! Why, how can it be otherwise P
Just run down and open the letter-bag ; you know where
to ﬁnd the key."
“Yes, my lady.”
As Mary Forest left the room, she cast at her beloved
mistress, whose eyes were ﬁxed thoughtfully upon the
pattern of the carpet, and observed her not, a look of
unspeakable love and pity; and when the door was shut
between them, she burst into a passion of silent tears.

“It will kill her,” murmured she; “she can never
survive this second trouble. Sorrow and shame, sorrow
and shame, are all that fall to my dear mistress now.
How shall I tell her? May Heaven give her strength
to bear it; but I wish, for her sake, that she was dead,
and already the angel she deserves to be Ah, you
minxJ” ejaculated Mary, interrupting herself as she
passed Miss Aynton’s room, and shaking her plump ﬁst
at its unconscious tenant; “you'll go to quite another
place, and serve you right too." And seemingly com-
forted by this reﬂection, she wiped her eyes with the
hem of her apron, and hurried down the back-stairs upon
her errand.
“What will Arthur think?” mused my lady, as she
awaited her maid’s return with a beating heart. “He
will certainly connect the request to destroy that letter
with what I said to him at the Watersmeet a while ago,
about ”——-she did not utter the concluding words at all,
but only formed them with her lips—“ poor Ralph. If
Arthur suspects, it will be with him the ﬁrst- step to
knowledge; and yet he would never use it to my hurt.
If there were anything amiss in the concealment of this
matter, then I should fear him, for he is the soul of
honour. But my bastard son—God help him, if he ever
comes to know it—robs nobody even of this barren title,
and my children’s money is due to no one else. They might
have been paupers as well as bastards ; let their mother
comfort herself with that thought all she can.” My
lady’s lips were crooked into a bitter smile: hers was
not a cynical face—far from it—and such an expression
misbecame it sadly ; it looked more like a contortion of
'the mouth induced by bodily pain.—“Well, Mary, is
there no letter from Mr. Arthur? "
“No, Ma’am; none.”
“ Then there is one more cause for anxiety added to
the rest of my troubles, that is all. Ah me, how foolishly
I used. to fret myself in days when there was no cause !

the London address of—of that person, could he?”
“Very likely, my lady, yes—at least, I don’t know.”
“Mary!”
“I beg your pardon, Madam," replied the waiting-
maid, starting like one aroused from a dream. “I was
not thinking what I said; Iwas thinking of something
else.”
“ I think you might give me your attention, Mary,” re-
turned my lady sighing: “you cannot be' thinking of
anything so momentous as this matter, which involves
sorrow, shame, and perchance utter ruin."
“Alas! but I can, my lady," answered the other
gravely; “'and I am doing it. There has something

“ More secrets ! more deception, Mary ! Spare me, if
you can, dear friend ; I am sorely tried already.”
“I cannot spare you, my lady, or I would do so,
Heaven knows; nay, I would almost take the shame
upon my own shoulders, if that might shield you from
the sorrow it must needs bring with it. Miss Letty ”
“It is not ﬁt that Shame and my daughter should be
mentioned in the same breath," replied my lady, rising,
and speaking with dignity. “ Do not continue; I forbid
you to speak. What you were going to say is false, and
I will not listen."
“ It is true, my lady—true as that the sun is shining
now. Of course, Miss Letty has nothing to do with it 3
but it was through her I learned it."
“ Does she know it, then P ” asked my lady sternly.
“ Certainly not, Madam ; and Heaven grant she never
may. She's as pure-minded as any seraph, and, like
Charity, thinketh no evil. But she told me this after-
noon—seeing that you were troubled, and not liking to
pain you, perhaps without reason, and speaking to me as
her old nurse and friend, who loves all the Lisgards,
good and bad (for they are not all good, alas, alas! ),
and who will love them to the end—she told me that
something which she had overheard between Miss Rose
and Master Walter—-—~"
“ You mean Sir Richard,” interposed my lady.
“No, Madam—his brother. It was Master Walter
that I was speaking of the other day in the carriage, and
whom I understood your ladyship to say that Miss
Aynton had refused. I knew very well that they were
love-making, ﬂirting and such like upon the sly ; but I
did not know—I could not suspect Oh! mistress
dear, a terrible disgrace. has befallen you, through that
infamous young hussy, Miss Rose Aynton—though what
Master Walter could have seen in the jade, I am sure
passes my comprehension altogether."
“Disgrace! Walter! Rose Aynton! What do you

be mad, to say such things. I heard Sir Richard ask
the girl to be his wife with my own cars, and she refused
him.”
“ Did she, my lady? Well, I’m surprised at that, for
I should have thought she would have stuck at 1wt/ling.-—-
But let me tell the whole story. What Miss Letty heard
at the picnic was this : she heard Master Walter cursing
Miss Rose. That was an odd thing for a young gentle-
man to do to a young lady—although, for that matter, I
have no doubt she deserved it—was it not? Well, that
was what Miss Letty thought. She had never heard such
words before, and could scarcely force her innocent lips
to repeat them; but I made her do it. And certainly
Master Walter expressed himself pretty strong. It seems
he was angered about the young woman‘s behaviour to
his brother yesterday -——"
“Aye,” interrupted my lady, quietly, and still thinking
that the prejudice of her waiting-maid had much ex-
aggerated matters, “that was partly my fault; I begged
Miss Aynton to be more complaisant in her manner to
Sir Richard.” '.
“Well, Master Walter might have been annoyed,
Madam, but what right had he to be jazz/our? and
especially what relation could exist between him and
Miss Rose, which justiﬁed him in using such dreadful
words P Fancy swz'ariug at her, my lady 1"
“Yes, that is shocking indeed, Mary. Miss Letty,
however, must certainly have misunderstood him."
“That’s what I told her, my lady, in hopes to quiet
her a bit ; but I did not believe it myself, no more than
you do. We don’t suppose that Miss Letty invented the
oaths, do we P”
“That is true," sighed Lady Lisgard. “ It makes me
very wretched to think that my boy Walter should have
so far forgotten himself as to use such language to a
young girl—a guest, too, in his mother‘s house. I shall
certainly demand an explanation of it from his own

“Alas, there is no need, Madam," returned the waiting-
maid. “I can tell you all—if you can bear to listen
to it.”
“ I am listening,” said my lady, wearily ; but she sat
with her back towards Mistress Forest, and once, in the
course of her recital, she uttered a piteous moan, and
covered her face with her hands.

lady, and had parted from me a little comforted, trying to
persuade herself that she really might have been mistaken
in what she had overheard, I instantly sought out Anne
Rees, and bade her come with me to my room. You
wouldn’t have believed it in a girl as you yourself chose
out of the village school, and who has been at the Abbey
under my own eye for four years ; but she refused point-
blank: very respectful, I must say, but also very ﬁrm.
‘ I dursn’t do it,’ said she, all of a twitter—‘not till Miss
Rose is abed and asleep ; or if I do, you may be certain
sure as she will come to know it, and get out of me every
word that may pass between us two.’
“The girl looked as scared as though she had seen a
ghost, and yet my request did not seem to come on her
at all unexpected; and, in point of fact, she knew what
she was wanted for well enough. However, I thought it
best to let her have her way ; and so it was arranged that
she was to come to my room as soon as she had done
with the young ladies—although ’tis little enough, indeed,
she has done for Miss Letty of late weeks, but all for that
spiteful little hussy, Miss Rose.
“‘Now,’ said I, when I 'got her alone, ‘Anne Rees,
there is nobody to listen to what we say, and you may
speak to me as to your own mother.’ .
“ ‘Ah, Mistress Forest,’ answered she, beginning to
whimper, ‘I only wish I dared.’
“‘This young lady has got you under her thumb, I
see, Anne. Now, if you’ll tell me the whole truth of
what is going on between her and Master Walter, I
promise you that I’ll turn her thumb bark. It will hurt

her a little—and that you won’t be sorry for, perhaps—-
and it will set you free.’
“‘Oh, Mistress Forest, if you could only do 11ml, I
would be a good girl all my life, and never try on other
people’s clothes again, nor be a spy upon my lady, and—'
Here she stopped quite short, and looked as though she
would have bitten her tongue off.
“ ‘ Now, Anne,’ said I, ‘you must tell me, whether you
will or not : for you have gone too far to turn back. How
did Miss Rose Aynton make a slave of a well-conducted
girl like you—with nothing but vanity, that I know of, to
be said against you—and compel you to do all this dirty
work for her ?'
“ ‘ Well, Mistress Forest, as you truly say, I was always
a vain child ; and Heaven has punished me pretty sharp
for it. One day, when the young ladies were out, and
I was in Miss Aynton’s room a-setting it to rights, what
should I come upon—where, perhaps, I had no right .to
look for it, for it was evidently meant to be hidden—but
a queer-shaped leather-box with trinkets in it.’
“ ‘ A jewel-case, I suppose you mean, Anne.’
“‘Yes, Ma'am ; but they were none of those as Miss
Aynton was in the habit of wearing—nor had she that
box when she ﬁrst came : she must have brought it down
with her after she went back to London for a week in the
early part of the year. However, all as struck me then
was the beauty of the jewels ; and I thought there was no
harm in my just trying them on in the front of the swing
mirror. My ears not being pierced, I couldn’t ﬁx the
earrings, although I wouldn’t a-minded a little pain, and
they sparked like morning dew ; but I clasped on the
pearl necklace and the bracelets, and stood admiring
myself in the looking-glass a good long time. Then all
of a sudden I saw an angry face looking over my shoulder,
and heard a cruel voice whisper: “ Thief, thief ! ” just
like the hiss of a wood-snake. I scarcely recognised
Miss Rose, who had always looked so pleasant, and been
such a smooth-spoken young lady.’

“ “I could send you to prison, Anne Rees, for this,"
continued she, very grave and slow ; “and I 1:117], too, if
you don’t do everything I tell you. I hate a thief."
“ “ Lor, Miss,” cried I, “have mercy, forHeaven’s sake !
I never meant to thieve nothing.”
“ “And I hate a liar,” added she, looking so cold and
cruel that she made me shudder. “You break open my
drawer—not a word, you bad girl, or I’ll send to Dalwynch
for a policeman—and I actually ﬁnd my property on
your very person ! You ought to go to jail for this ,- and
perhaps I am wrong not to send you there. However,
remember: from this moment, youare my servant—only
mine ; and whatever I tell you to do, whether it is against
your late mistress or not, see that you do it; and dare
not to breathe one word of anything that I do, or speak,
or possess—such as these jewels, for instance—or you
will me it bitterly, Anne Rees.”
“ ‘Of course I promised, Mistress Forest, for I was in
sucha state of terror that I would have promised any-
thing ; but you cannot imagine to what a slavery I bound
myself 1’
“‘I know all about that, Anne,’ said I: ‘everybody
knows you’re becoming a spy and a sneak. But there is
no occasion for you to follow such vocations any longer.
My lady would never believe a word of your intending to
steal those things : I can promise you her protection; so
make your mind quite easy upon that p0int.——But now,
what about Master Walter P ’
“ ‘Well, Mistress Forest, the jewels were his present, to
begin with. '1‘here__have been very wicked goings on. It
was quite dreadful to see her kiss dear good Miss Letty
at night, and return her “God bless you l ” so pious like,
when she was not blessing her—I mean Miss Rose—at
all. Oh, Mistress Forest, I have known all this for
weeks and weeks, and dared not speak one word; and
now the truth is almost too terrible to tell.’ ”
“And then, my lady,” pursued Mistress Forest, “she
told me things which it is not necessary to repeat to you.

I knew she was telling truth ; but in order to assure myself
that it was so, I crept out with naked feet, and listened
at Miss Aynton’s door, and I heard two voices "
“ Did you rerag/zz're them, woman ; are you sure of that? ”
asked my lady, sternly.
“Ah, yes, Madam—there is no doubt.”
“ Heaven help us, and forgive us I” murmured my
lady, with bowed head. “Ah, Walter, Walter, I had ex-
pected shame, but not from deed of yours ! Where is this
—Miss Aynton, Mary P ”
“At her breakfast, my lady ; and doubtless making an
exceedingly good one. Size is not one to let her con-
Science interfere with her appetite, bless you] Like the
murderer under sentence in Dalwynch jail, as I read of in
the paper yesterday, she ‘takes her meals with regularity,'
I warrant ; and does not in any way physically deteriorate
under the distressing circumstances of her situation.”
“ Send her to me, Mary—in the boudoir yonder,” said
my lady, gravely. “ Tell her I desire to speak with her
very particularly. Breakfast? N o, alas ! I feel as though
a morsel of food would choke me. Send her hither at
once."

CHAPTER XXIII.
TH RU ST AN D COUNTER-TH RUST.
CANNOT, for my own part, at all agree with the
depreciatory expressions used by Mistress
Forest with respect to Miss Rose Aynton’s
personal appearance. “What Master Walter
could have seen in her,” &c., it was easy enough for
anybody else to see who was not of her own sex. A magni-
ﬁcent ﬁgure, masses of silken hair that, when unbound,
would ripple almost to her dainty feet, and a countenance
“bright as light, and clear as wind;” and indeed this
latter was too keen and sharply cut for my taste. The
sort of expression which one likes to see in one's lawyer,
does not so well become the object of our heart’s affections.
Of course, there was nothing of steel about Miss Rose,
except what might have been in her crinoline; but I
never saw man or woman who gave me so much the idea
of being armed cap-dirk; she seemed to be equipped in
a complete Milan suit of proof, impregnable, invulncrable.
Like Le Nair Ezilzéant in Ivan/me, she never attacked
anybody, although my lady fancied she had recently
detected signs of aggression about her; and those who
knew her best avoided putting the temptation in her
way. But when she entered her hostess’s boudoir by in-
vitation, upon that particular morning, she looked not
only, as usual, on her guard; there was also a certain
slumbrous ﬁre in her dark eyes, which betokened on-

slaught—the initiative of battle. My lady herself re-
marked it, not without pity. “ How little is this poor lost
creature aware,” thought she, “that I know all."
But she was quite wrong in this. Miss Rose had
almost gathered the truth from the trembling ﬁngers and
frightened manner of her tiring-maid that morning; and
the thing had been quite conﬁrmed to her by the
malicious triumph with which Mary Forest had delivered
her mistress’s request to see her in the boudoir upon very
particular business.
“ Will you please to sit down, Miss Aynton ? ”
Yes, it was so. The secret was out. Not even a
morning salutation from her friend and hostess; and the
hand only outstretched to point her out a chair at the
other extremity of the room.
“Before proceeding with what I have to say,” began
my lady, “I wish to know whether your aunt is in
town.’
“I believe so, Lady Lisgard; I think she has come
back from Leamington—although I have not heard from
her for the last two days."
“That is well. When I hinted, yesterday morning,
that it would be better for you to return to London, I
was unaware of the 716“!qu for your departure from this
roof at once—imnudialely—and for ever."
‘ Indeed ! ’-’ .
Not a muscle moved: conﬁdent in the goodness, if
not of her cause, at least of her Milan suit; con-
scious, too, of the possession of ‘a Damascus poinard,
undreamed of by the foe, and admirable for close en-
counters, her right hand nervously opened and shut as
though to clutch the handle—that was all.
“ You have di5graced this house and me: yourself and
your sex.” . '
“ You lie,‘ insolent woman,” returned the other; “and
judge olllerr 11y yourrel .”
Each started to her feet, and looked her enemy in the
face as she slung these words of ﬂame.

2 r 8 MM: A May.
“ It is worse than useless, girl, thus to brazen it out,”
continued my lady, attaching no importance to the
emphasis the other laid upon her last words. “Out-
raging not only moral laws, but even the rites of hos-
pitality, you have intrigued with my own son under my,
own roof." _ -
“ You dare to say so, Lady Lisgard, do you? It is
only for his sake, I swear, that I do not brand you
wanton, for that calumny. I could do it; you know I
could, although you wear that look of wonder. Was not
that man Derrick once your lover? Ah! you wince at
that. Sir Robert—good, easy man—he knew nothing, of
course-——"
Here she stopped, for my lady’s face was terrible to
look upon.
“Be silent, bad, bold girl ! You shoot your poisoned
arrows at aventure, and aim nothing home. You know
not what a wife should be—how should you P You I"
It is not true that the swan is “born to be the only
graceful shape of Scorn.” A fair woman unjustly slandered
is its rival therein. Rose Aynton cowered before that
keen contempt—beneath the dropping of those bitter
words—as though they were sword and ﬁre.
“I will never forgive you this, Lady Lisgard,” muttered
she—“ never, never ! ”
“You! you forgive! To such as you, it would be idle
to protest my soul is spotless. The man whose name
you have soiled by uttering it~my husband—he, in high
heaven, knows right well that never so much as thought
of mine has wronged him. Vile, evil-minded girl, as
false as frail ! "
“That is sufﬁcient, Madam; almost enough, even if I
were indeed the thing you take me for.” Here the girl
paused to moisten her dry lips, and catch her breath, of
which passion had almost deprived her. “Now, look
you, I was wrong. I thought my lady was not so lily-
pure as the world took her to be, and I was wrong. I
have seen things with my own eyes, and through the eyes

of others, that might well entitle me to say: ‘I still
believe it.’ I tell you, Lady Lisgard, I have proq/Ir—or
what seemed to me to be so, a few minutes back—of the _
charge that_has so moved you, such as would amply
justify my disbelief in your denial. But I honestly avow
that I was wrong."
“ I thank you, Miss Rose Aynton, for your charity.”
“Spare your scorn, Madam. It is no charity that
moves me ,' nay, far from it. Convinced almost against
my will, I own, by your unsupported assertion—your
mere ‘ No,’ I have withdrawn an accusation for which I
have been patiently preparing evidence this long time—
not, indeed, for your hurt, but for my own safety and
convenience, and hereby confess it baseless and unjust.
Now, on your part, I do beseech you, make amends to
me. You, too, have had your seeming proofs of my dis-
grace ; you, too, have heard and seen yourself, or through
the eyes and ears of others, certain
“Add not, lost, wretched girl," interposed my lady,
“deceit to sin I All that is left you is to pray to Heaven
for pardon, and to leave that hospitable roof which you
have disgraced.”
Rose Aynton’s gipsy face grew drawn and pale. She
had aimed her blow, and missed; the weapon in which
she had put so much trust had proved utterly good for
nothing. All her schemes of the last few months were
rendered fruitless, and the discoveries to which she had
attached such vast importance, and which she had
attained to by such mean arts, shown to be vain and
futile.
And now that she had humiliated herself by owning
this, and thrown herself at this woman’s feet, she
would not extend so much as a ﬁnger-tip to help her.
“Lady Lisgard, as I hope for heaven," cried she in
anguish, “I am innocent of that with which you charge
me ; I am honest as yourself, or Letty. Alas, you shudder,
because I dare to compare myself with your pure daughter ;
you think that I soil that name, too, by uttering it. What

shall I say—by'what shall I swear; in order to make you
believe me?" '
“I would to Heaven I :01de believe you, Rose,” re-
turned my lady sadly, touched in spite of herself by the
girl’s yearning appeal. “ If you could erase this damning
blot upon my son’s fair name, and give me back my
Walter—as I deemed him but an hour ago—I would be
so grateful, girl, that you should almost think I loved
you."
“You would /” cried Rose with eagerness ; then added
bitterly: “ But no ; you mean if I could say: ‘ Your son
has never pressed his lips to these, has never sworn to
be mine, and mine alone.’ But you would not thank me
for merely proving that in this, although he did it, he was
not to blame."
“ What ! not to blame P"
“ No, Madam—for even for 112': sake, I cannot longer
bear this burden of undeserved shame. Whiter Lisgard
1': my husband. We were married weeks ago, when I
went to London in the spring.”
“Married, married ! " gasped my lady. “ Thank God
for that! Far better to deceive me, boy, than this poor
girl. I never thought to say: ‘ I am glad you are my
daughter-in-law, Rose Aynton ;’ but I do say so now."
She took both her hands in hers, and gazed upon her
downcast face, now overspread with blushes, and tinged
for once with genuine tenderness. “ It moves you, does
it, that I am thankful to see the honour of my son pre-
served at some sacriﬁce of his prospects. How little do
you know me, girl ! yet I am glad to move you anyway.
Rose, be a kind wife to him. I will not blame you for
what has happened, although I have much cause. I must
blame lzz'm rather. Who can wonder that you yielded
when he said: ‘Be mine.’ So gentle and so loving as
he can be ! Now, too, I see it all. When you refused
Sir Richard in the library, you were actually his brother’s
wife. Ah, Heaven, you must not remain here longer-—
not a day. I shall write to Walter "

T/lrust and Counler- 77mm. 2 2 r
“ Nay, Madam—mother,” exclaimed Rose beseechingly,
“I pray you let me write. I have broken my plighted
word, and disobeyed my husband’s bidding in revealing
this. To please him, I had resolved to defend myself
this morning as I best might, by returning thrust for
thrust, without using this shield—my innocence—at all.
But your bitter words—a shower of barbed darts—drove
me behind it. He will be very wrath with me indeed,
Madam ; but far worse if the news comes from you. He
has much just now to make him anxious too.”
“Indeed,” replied my lady hastily. “How is it, then,
that I have heard nothing of it? But I forgot ; it is you
who have his secrets now. Yes, you shall write, not I. Tell
him that I am sorry—sorry that he should have deceived
me above all ,' but that I forgive him freely. He knows
that, however, right well. He must not come back to
Mirk until he hears from me; and you, Rose, you must
join him without delay. Every member of this household
must learn at once that you are Walter’s wife; but not
till you have gone—for Richard’s sake.”
My lady’s thoughts, as always, were for others; even
when this great blow had well-nigh stunned her, she did
not permit herself the luxury of selﬁsh grief. She was
already busy with schemes for the beneﬁt of her erring
boy; how to contrive and where to save without pre-
judice to Sir Richard’s interests (for llzat must be now
avoided above everything) so that a respectable allow-
ance might be meted out to the young couple. She
could not respect, and far less love the girl who had
become her Walter's wife in so clandestine a manner; but
still she was his wife, and therefore in her eyes, a some-
thing precious. Then, bad as matters were, they might
have been far worse; she had fully expected that they
were so ; and she felt in some sort grateful to accept this
product of rashness and deceit in place of downright
shame. Moreover, she foresaw in her own mind, for
ever dwelling on such contingencies, that out of this evil
a certain good might come, in case of that terrible mis-

fortune befalling her, compared with which this present
sorrow was as the prick of a pin’s point.
Rose, upon her part, had certainly cause for congra-
tulation upon the result of this interview. Although her
weapon of offence had failed her—and she was genuinely
convinced of the groundlessness of her late suspicions
concerning Lady Lisgard—she had found in her mother-
in-law a most generous adversary, and one certainly far
more forgiving than she deserved. Even the worst of us,
I conclude, are not bad at all times, and when my lady,
as they parted, touched her brow with her pale lips, and
murmured once more : “Be a kind wife to him, Rose,”
that young woman mustered an honest tear or two—of
which articles, to do her justice, she did not keep, like
some women, a constant supply on hand for social
emergencres.
Not until she regained her own room did she begin to
think that she had been unnecessarily humble, and had
weakly suffered herself to be moved by the show of for-
giveness and good-will which my lady had doubtless put
on for her own purposes. However, the confession had
been made, and upon the whole, most satisfactorily got
over, the thought of which had oppressed her of late
more than she cared to own, and made her bitter against
her mother-in law, as people generally feel towards those
whom they are conscious of having wronged. And now
there was that letter to write to Walter, which we have
seen him peruse with such disfavour at his hotel in town,
acquainting him with her premature avowal of their
common secret; and many aline of dexterous excuse
she wove, and many a line, of affectionate pleading,
only to be torn up and recomposed again and again ; for
there was one person in the world beside herself whom
Rose loved dearly, and yet of whom she stood in deepest
awe ; and he whom she both loved and feared with all
the strength of her energetic nature, was her husband——
Walter Lisgard.

CHAPTER XXIV.
N O LETTERS.


st; PON the morning after the interview between
i ‘1, Rose and Lady Lisgard, the latter again sent
if" down Mistress Forest for the post-bag, and
was once more disappointed at receiving no
news from Arthur Haldane ; not only did the interval of
twenty-four hours make this matter additionally serious,
and increase her former apprehensions that he had not
received her telegram, and might ﬁnd some means of
forwarding Derrick’s letter to himself—since it had cer-
tainly not come back to the Lisgard Arms,- but there
was a still graver cause for anxiety in the fact that Mary
Forest also received no reply from Ralph to that rejection
so decidedly yet courteously composed by her mistress,
with the view of taking away all hope, and at the same
time of leaving as little sting of anger as was possible.
Lady Lisgard would have almost preferred to have re-
ceived from this man a declaration of open warfare—an
expressed resolution of carrying away Mary as his wife,
in spite of all obstacles—rather than this menacing No
Answer. Contemptuous silence was not at all the natural
line for one of his violent character to take, if he had
decided to treat her waiting-woman’s letter as ﬁnal. He
was more likely in that case to have penned a tornado of
invective, and hidden both mistress and maid to have
gone to the devil. It seemed only too probable, then,

that he was determined—as he had threatened—to take
no denial; and that he would return in person, sooner
or later, to Mirk, to prosecute his suit.
My lady made certain preparations for that extremity
—nay, for the worst that could possibly arise—chief
among which was the composition of a very long and
carefully-conned epistle to her eldest son, that she put
by in her desk undated and unsealed, so that additions
could be made to it at pleasure. Then she waited in
agonies of suspense day after day; and yet no letter
came for her maid from Ralph, or for herself from Arthur
Haldane. Moreover, although, in her absorbing anxiety
about the more serious subject, this affected my lady far
less than it did Rose, no communication came from
Walter in answer to her long and justiﬁcatory letter, ac-
quainting him with the disclosure of their marriage. Our
readers are aware that this last circumstance was simply
due to the fact, that it was reposing in the “address-box "
of the 1714170ch, until such time as it caught the eye of
the overworked waiter, and was carried over with apologies
to Walter’s lodgings, whither he had given orders that
anything addressed to him should be conveyed forthwith.
But he had not particularly expected a letter from that
quarter—or, at all events, felt very anxious to get it—for
nobody but Rose would have written to him to the T 107'
Hair], all others at Mirk and elsewhere believing him to
be at Canterbury with his regiment, whence all communi-
cations were forwarded to him to his London lodgings.
Thus, from the very deceit to which she had lent herself
-—to her peculiar information as to his movements—was
this failure of Rose’s letter to reach her husband owing.
During this protracted interval, she suffered agonies of
suspense, of mortiﬁcation, and even of fear. It was
wormwood to have to_ say to her mother-in-law every
morning: “He has not written yet,” and thereby to
confess that Walter treated with indifference the em-
barrassing position in which she was now placed at Mirk
Abbey; moreover, she surmised that her husband was

too much enraged with her disobedience in betraying
their secret, to write at all.
His wife knew—although few others did—that Master
Walter was capable of being “ put out ” to a very consi-
derable extent. His very marriage with herself—although
she fortunately did not know that—had been mainly
owing to his impatience of opposition, and pique against
his elder brother. Doubtless propinquity and opportuni-
ties of ﬂirtation with a beautiful and aCcomplished girl,
not by any means lavish of her smiles, but whose devotion
to himself had been almost that of a slave for her master,
had carried the handsome captain towards the gulf of
matn'mony ; but it was the desire to thwart Sir Richard
——who, his jealous eye perceived, was falling seriously in
love with Rose long before she saw it—which was the
ﬁnal cause of his rash act. He eagerly snatched at an
occasion at once of self-gratiﬁcation, and of humiliating
his proud and arrogant brother. He was delighted to
let him know that neither his wealth nor his title could
weigh in the balance of a woman’s favour against the
gifts and graces which it was his habit to depreciate or
ignore. We have said that he discovered Sir Richard’s
passion even before the object of it ; but Rose’s subtle
brain was already preoccupied with himself. To give
that scheming beauty her due, I think that even had she
not been already Walter’s wife, she would not have ex-
changed him for the baronet, at the period when he made
her that dazzling offer in the library. She felt that she ,
had let slip a splendid prize, and was proportionally
angry with Sir Richard, whose backwardness and hauteur
had prevented her from recognising the possibility of its
falling to her lot 3 but the feeling of disappointment was
but transient; she was a bride of only a few weeks, and
to get disenchanted of one like Walter Lisgard is a long
process even for a. wife. By this time, however, though
she idolised him, still Rose had learned to fear him; and
absolutely dared not pen another letter to inquire the
reason of his silence. .

Of those who waited, sick at heart, for the coming of
the postman every morning, Lady Lisgard, therefore, was
the ﬁrst to lose patience. She wrote to Arthur Haldane
a few urgent lines, requesting his immediate presence at
Mirk “upon private and particular business ,' " and within
an hour of their receipt he took the train, and appeared
in person at the Abbey. My lady had decided to consult
him, in preference to his father, respecting the arrange-
ments necessary to be made for the future maintenance
of Walter and his wife, since it would be very unwise to
make so much importance of the matter concerning
Derrick, about which she was in reality vastly more con-
cerned, and burned to know the truth.
“ What is the matter, 1110 we‘re?” inquired he tenderly,
when, not without the exercise of some address—for Sir
Richard was always hospitable, and (especially in the
absence of his brother) both gracious and attentive to all
guests—Arthur and my lady had managed to get an hour
to themselves in the boudoir. “ You look very pale and
anxious.”
“Yes, Arthur, I have enough to make me so. Walter
has secretly made Rose Aynton his wife. Ah ! you pity
me, I see, and perhaps him also. Do not condole with
me, however. I have sent for you hither to help me to
make the best Alas, alas, you would not have
believed it of my Walter, would you P” And my lady,
touched by the sympathising look and manner of the
honest young fellow, burst into the ﬁrst “good cry ”
which she had permitted to herself since the calamity
had been discovered; for when conﬁding the circum-
stance to Letty, it had been her duty to bear up, and
when alone, a still more serious anxrety consumed her.
Even now, her emotion, though violent, was soon over,
and the indulgence in it seemed to have done her good.
“Pardon me, Arthur,” said she, with one of her old
smiles ; “I won’t be foolish any more." And then, after
narrating matters with which we are acquainted, she laid
before him, as concisely as she could, what funds at her

owu disposal could be made available to form an income
for the young couple, in addition to the interest which
Walter‘s fortune of ﬁve thousand pounds or so, into the
possession of which he would come in some eighteen
months, would yield. She little knew that on that very
night—for it was the eve of the Derby Day—the unworthy
boy, for whom she was making such sacrifices, was about
to risk and lose more than a third of his patrimony, and
that upon the next day the remainder was doomed to go,
and much more with it.
“But this will pinch you, ma mére," reasoned Arthur
kindly, “and narrow your own already somewhat scanty
revenue sadly. Sir Richard will come into a very ﬁne
rent-roll in June, beside thousands "
“But can we ask him to help Walter and 111': ref/v?
And could Walter take it, even if his brother were generous
enough to offer it P”
“Sir Richard is quite capable of such magnanimity,
ma mére, unless I am much mistaken in his character.
He would not like to see his brother—even were he but
a Lisgard, let alone his so near kith and kin—in a posi-
tion that would be discreditable to the family; while if
one has really loved a woman, one surely does not wish
to see her poor and struggling, simply because she has
preferred some one else. As for Walter’s accepting the
help which his brother can so well spare—it may be a
little bitter—but, in my opinion, that would be far prefer-
able to receiving what would impoverish his mother.
The arrangements you propose would leave you but three
hundred pounds a year.”
“Yes,” answered my lady hastily, “I require that for
a purpose, else half the sum would easily suﬁ‘ice my pre-
sent needs.”
“ It would do nothing of the sort, ma mére. Come, let
us be reasonable. If you will leave this matter in my
hands, I will endeavour to be the mediator between your
sons. Sir Richard has an honest regard for me, I think,
and Walter also, when he is himself."

“Poor Walter 1” murmured my lady, sighing.
“Yes, he is to be pitied,” answered the other drily ;
“but also, between ourselves —-— although I shall en-
deavour, after my lawyer instincts, to make it appear
otherwise to his brother—to be somewhat blamed, ma
mére. Since, then, I am prepared, under the cloak of
arbitrator, to be the partisan of your darling Yes,
they are both your darlings, Lady Lisgard, I know, but
with a difference.”
“ Walter is in trouble," urged my lady pitifully.
“Yes, that is the reason, of course. However, will
you put the case unreservedly in my own hands? for if
so, although it is not an easy task, I will do my best to
make your sons shake hands.”
“There is none like you, Arthur, none. Heaven bless
you and reward you !"
“There may be none like me, ma 7112'”, but there are
also, I hope, many people a great deal better. And now
that we have done with this matter for the present, may
I ask, Why letters are directed to another person, under
care to me, which I am at the same time directed by
telegram to put behind the ﬁre?”
“Oh, you got that telegram, did you? ” said my lady
quietly. “Mary Forest entreated me so to send it. The
fact was, she accepted that person by letter—what was
his name P—of whom we spoke together some time ago
at the Watersmeet; but afterwards, persuaded by me
(acting in accordance with your suggestion, you re-
member), she decided to refuse him. But the ﬁrst letter
was unfortunately posted before the second was written;
and the postmistress at Dalwynch positively refused to give
it up, although I drove over there myself to request it.”
“Well, upon my life, ma mt‘w, but you’re a bold
woman,” exclaimed the young lawyer, laughing. “Why,
of course, she wouldn’t give it up. She would be steal-
ing the property of the Postmastergeneral if she had
done so, and you would be the receiver with the guiltiest
knowledge.”

“Well, at all events, she did not,” pursued my lady
simply. “She would do nothing beyond directing the
envelope afresh to your address.”
“ Honest creature l” interrupted Arthur grimly.
“ Under these circumstances, I telegraphed to you,
knowing that you would be good enough to destroy the
letter directly it reached you.”
“Yes, ma mérr, and I did so," returned Arthur gravely ;
“but I feared it was not right, and now that you have
told me this, I know that it was wrong. You may have
had your reasons, dear Lady Lisgard, and doubtless very
urgent ones, to wish the destruction of those letters."
“ Those letters I” exclaimed my lady.
“Yes, I am certain, of course, that you intended no
harm to anyone, and that what you did was in ignorance
of the law ,' but so suspicious was I of your having trans-
gressed it—and at the same time, perhaps, a little annoyed
that you should have chosen me, Lady Lisgard, for your
instrument in such a matter—that I purposely omitted to
communicate with you, to put in writing any evidence
whatsoever of that transaction."
“ Yes, yes,” said my lady hastily, and taking no notice
of the young man’s evident annoyance. “ But you speak
of let/err. There was only one letter directed to Pump
Court.”
“There were two, Lady Lisgard, and both addressed
in the same handwriting. The words, Turf Hole],
Pirradz'lly, were crossed out also, in each case, I re-
member, in red ink. It was the postmistress who did it,
I have no doubt. If you led her to imagine that that
was the wrong address in the one instance, she naturally
imagined it to be so in the other, and probably made the
alteration in all good faith.”
“ Great Heaven, and so it must have been!” ex-
claimed my lady, clasping her hands. “ Oh Arthur, this
mischance —if my misconduct does indeed deserve
punishment, has brought, I fear, a very harsh and bitter
one—that is on Mary. The second letter should have

reached the person to whom it was addressed without
fail. He will now have heard nothing—this Derrick;
and he will take the woman’s silence for consent. Oh
Arthur, Arthur, you little know what bad news this is."
“ I can see, ma mére, that it vexes you,” answered the
young man kindly; “and that is evil enough for me to
know. Some sorrows are best kept to one’s self, I think.
Now, look you, this Mr. Derrick will certainly, being a
sporting-man, be in town to-morrow night. He will not
have left his hotel before the Derby is over. Now, I
will go and seek him out tomorrow with the letter in my
hand that Mary shall re-write. We have only but a veiy
little time, remember." _
“ Dear Arthur, counsellor, and friend, and son in one,
what comfort do you not give me in all straits l" She
rose and oﬁ'ered him her pale but comely cheek, which
the young man touched with reverent lips ; then holding
her hand in his, he said in a ﬁrm voice : “ And now, ma
mt‘rc, even that is not fee enough for such an avaricious
lawyer as I am. I have promised myself a talk with
Letty.”
“Do so, and Heaven bless you, my dear boy—ay,
bless you both," continued my lady, when he had left
the room, “for you would take her for your wife even
though you knew what I know of her unhappy birth. I
have almost a mind to tell him; but then, with his stern
notions of what is right—although, Heaven, knows, I
wrong no one by this reticence—he might—— ‘Some
sorrows are best kept to one’s self, I think,’ said he.
And whether he suspects something amiss, and meant
the words for my particular ear or not, it is sound advice.
Sufﬁcient for'the day is the evil thereof. If I were
always to be thinking of the morrow, I should soon go
mad.”

CHAPTER XXV.
MR. ARTHUR HALDANE MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL.
OME writers are very fond of describing inter-
' views between betrothed persons, and there
are undoubtedly readers who take a pleasure
in reading such delicate details; and yet it
seems strange that this should be so, with respect to the
mere description of what in real life is undoubtedly tame
and stupid to the lookenon; for what can be duller, or
more uninteresting, except to one another, than “an
engaged couple P " With what meaningless emphasis they
smile! what mysterious secrets (known to every adult in
the company) they interchange ,- and how they go blindly
feeling after one another’s hands under the table, when-
ever the opportunity oﬁers. I think it even profane to
mention such tender-mysteries. Arthur Haldane and
Letty Lisgard were not indeed a betrothed couple when
they met upon the present occasion, but they became so
before they parted. Their subject of conversation being
the marriage of somebody else, it naturally enough strayed
to their own. “I am not a good match for you, Letty,
just at present,” said the young man frankly, during a
lucid interval, “but I do not despair of removing the
disparity of fortune. I am getting on in my profession
better than I could have hoped for." '
“ I don't see why ‘disparity’ of any sort, dear Arthur,
should affect persons who really love one another.”

“ That's my own sweet Letty,” replied the other
(relapsing). “But then your family—no exertions of
mine can procure for me such a pedigree as you can
boast of.”
“That is a matter of genuine congratulation, Arthur.
Dear Richard often makes me wish that there were no
such things as ancestors. I suppose it is a. dreadful
heresy, but it seems to me so strange that people are not
taken for what they are, let their birth be what it will."
“My Rose of Radicals!" exclaimed the young man
with admiration; “your words deserve to be written in
letters of gold.” And so saying, he took out his pocket-
book, and, in spite of her opposition, transcribed them
then and there.
“ Of what possible good can that be, you dear foolish
fellow?"
“ I cannot say for certain, Letty," answered he gravely.
“But keep a thing long enough, and its use will come,
folks say."
Mr. Arthur Haldane had, as we are aware, some other
interviews awaiting him, less agreeable than the one on
hand, which perhaps may account for his prolonging it to
an inordinate length. There was no difference of opinion
expressed in this one ; and what is unusual in arguments
between the sexes, the lady had not the last word at
parting. Strictly speaking, neither had it. The farewell
of each expired almost at the same instant, and was not
breathed into the ear at all: I say “almost” advisedly,
and from a desire to be accurate, for if each imprints a
kiss upon the other’s Meek, they cannot do it quite c0in~
cidentally ; and it is certain, if the statistics of the matter
could be collected, that nine engaged couples (for, of
course, no couple does it who are not engaged) out of
every ten do salute one another in that way, and not
press “lip to lip,” as the poets make out; in fact, it
requires a particular and uniform comformation of nose
—blboth must be “ snubs "—to render the thing practic-
a e.

Sir Richard, whom we have been compelled occasion-
ally to represent in an unfavourable light, did not fall
short, in his interview with Arthur Haldane, of the high
estimate which the latter had formed of his chivalric
nature; or perhaps it was through his overweening pride,
that could not permit the woman upon whom his affec-
tions had once condescended to rest, to be inconven-
ienced by narrow circumstances; but actuated by what-
ever motive, his behaviour towards the rash young couple
was liberal in the extreme. He accepted very willingly
the explanation, given by the young lawyer with great
tact, of his refusal by Rose Aynton. No utterance was
given to the remark, that if he had pressed his suit a
little earlier, doubtless no thought of his younger brother
would have entered the girl’s brain; but the suggestion
was, somehow or other, delicately conveyed, and in that
Gilead there was balm. Strange as it may appear, the
object of his rejected suit seemed to have won forgive-
ness not only for herself, but for her husband, to whose
faults he had heretofore shown himself so unfratemally
alive. He certainly did not request Arthur to offer his
congratulations to the young Benedict; but he sent by
him a conciliatory message, and a special request that
Captain and Mrs. Lisgard would not fail to visit the
Abbey upon the occasion of the approaching file. The
period of his own comingr of age would be a very ﬁtting
one for the newly-married pair to introduce themselves to
the people of the country, while their presence at such a
time would evidence that there was no family breach. In
all this, there was doubtless a leaven of selﬁshness; but
there was considerable magnanimity also, and the manner
in which the baronet spoke of Rose herself would have
done honour to Bayard. In this matter, it must be even
conceded that he showed more nobility of spirit than the
ladies of his household. His mother had forgiven the
girl, after a fashion, it is true; but her feelings towards
her were anything but genial. One’s heart cannot be
made to yearn towards a sly and deceitful young person,

just because she happens to be one’s daughter-in-lawi'
Her pity for Walter was great, but it did not beget love
for lzer.
With Letty, again, Rose stood even lower, or perhaps
seemed to do so, from the higher eminence which she
had previously occupied in the affections of her school-
friend. A young lady who has sworn an eternal friend-
ship, does not relish‘the discovery that the other party
to that solemn transaction has been making a fool of
her under her own roof for months! nay, has been
systematically deceiving her upon a matter, mutual
conﬁdences concerning which form the very basis of
such compacts—namely, the beloved object. Young
men do not encourage one another to communicate
their honest love-secrets, although some are boastful
enough of their conquests over the sex, where there
is no pretence of the heart being concerned: but
with young ladies, this sort of information is the most
prized of all. There is a tacit, if not an expressed
understanding between female friends, that the ﬁrst
genuine “attachment” formed by either shall at once
be revealed to the other. The expectation of that
tender avowal is what is uppermost in their minds
whenever they meet; and when it has been made,
what an endless subject of sympathy does the uncon-
scious swain become between these devoted young
persons! How the qualities of his mind are can-
vassed, and the colour of his hair; how his religious
principles are eulogised, and also his small feet; and
how, in short, the betrothed and her faithful con-
ﬁdante construct a mental and physical ideal for
Jones, out of what they have read of the Admirable
Crichton and the Apollo Belvedere. Letty Lisgard
was as good a girl — in my opinion — as ever drew
breath,- but she was human, and when she kissed
Rose the ﬁrst time after she learned she had become
her sister, it was by no means the impassioned salute
which it had used to be, nor had her “my dear,"

although delivered with emphasis, at all the genuine
rmg.
As for the other females at the Abbey, it was fortunate
for Rose that she had not to apply to Mom for a
character 3 for although Mistress Forest knew her place
better than to circulate scandal, Miss Anne Rees, no
longer restrained by terror of constahulary, indemniﬁed
herself for previous reticence, by favouring her fellow-
servants with some very curious details indeed with
respect to Mrs. Walter Lisgard. My lady’s proposal,
that Rose should take advantage of Mr. Arthur Haldane’s
escort on the morrow to her aunt’s house, until she should
receive her husband’s directions as to her future place of
abode, was, I think, very generally welcomed, and felt to
be a relief by the whole house.
During the long railway journey to town, however,
she made herself agreeable enough to her companion,
as she was well able to do, when so disposed, to all
his sex. The young barrister was prudent and sagacious-
beyond his years, and what he knew of the lady’s be-
haviour, did not certainly prepossess him in her favour;
but, nevertheless, he was obliged to confess to himself
(although he omitted to do so to Letty) that Mrs. Walter
Lisgard was avery charming person. It is undeniable
that a married woman may make herself twice as
pleasant, for any short interval, like a railway journey,
as any single one can do; she is not afraid of being
considered too forward, or of laying herself out to
captivate ; while, if you are a bachelor with whose
tendrarre for any fair one she is acquainted, she will take
you under her patronage, notwithstanding that you may
be twice her age, and so sympathise with you, and
identify herself with your absent intended, that you are
half inclined to squeeze her hand, and cover it with
kisses. Mr. Arthur Haldane had much too judicial a
mind to give way to any impulse of that kind, but it was
very nice to hear Rose eulogise her “ darling Letty,”
and protest that the man who married her would ﬁnd

himself united with an angel. He quite forgot, under
this soothing treatment, that his impression on leaving
the Abbey was, that the two young ladies were not very
good friends,- nor did it occur to him at all that this
privilege of matronly talk was being exercised by a bride
not two months wedded, and whose surreptitious
marriage had only been discovered about a week ago.
When they had reached London, and were approaching
her aunt’s residence in the late afternoon, they found
themselves suddenly in a broad stream of vehicles, for
the most part furnished with four horses, but very unlike
the usual spick-and-span London equipages, being
covered uu'th white dust, and bearing traces of recent
rapid travel.
“I quite forgot it was the Derby Day,’ exclaimed
Arthur: “these are the gentlemen of the road, and I
dare say your husband is among them."
Rose turned quite pale, and leaning back in the cab,
did not again look out of window until they arrived at
her aunt’s door, where the two companions parted very
good friends indeed. Rose gave a little sigh as she
thanked him for his escort, which went—not indeed to
the young man’s heart, but a good way too.
“I hope Master Walter does not ill-treat that poor
girl,” soli-loquised Arthur as he drove away ; “but I am
almost certain that she’s afraid of him."
London after the Derby is more like Pandemonium
even than on the night before ; the winners are wild with
joy, and inclined for any sort of dissipation; the losers
also crave for the Circean cup, that they may temporarily
forget their misfortunes. With the unusual roar of wheel
and hoof in the streets, there mixes a still more unusual
shouting; and from the open windows of places of
entertainment, there streams forth the tangled talk which
is conﬁned within doors at other times. Before Arthur
could reach the Turf [Io/cl, he learned from these
sources, without further inquiry, that Tﬁe King had won
the race, in consequence of some mischance having

happened to the jockey of Mane/aux. He knew, there-
fore that Walter Lisgard had lost money. Still, when
upon reaching his lodging he ﬁrst set eyes upon the
young dragoon, moodin stretched upon the sofa, with
eyes staring straight before him, and a face as pale as the
table-cloth, on which stood an untasted meal, he was
astonished and shocked. For the moment —— such a
rigidity was there about those exquisite features—Arthur
thought with a. shudder that he was dead. Even after
he entered the room, lit only from the glaring street, not
alimb stirred, not a muscle moved to mark any con-
sciousness of his presence; but when he exclaimed:
“Walter! what's the matter, man?” the ﬁgure leapt
up with a cry of pleasure, and took both his hands
in his.
“I am glad to see you, Arthur,” cried he. “ This is
very kind of you, and I do not deserve it. I thought it
was that infernal scoundrel Derrick.”
“ He is not here, then P ” .
“No ; he may have come and gone, for all I know,
for I believe I have been in a sort of nightmare ; only it
was a horse that caused it. Derrick’s partner—0r
Derrick himself, for what I know—sold the race. I
know what you are going to say, that you always told me
how it would be ”
“ N o, indeed, Walter," interrupted Arthur kindly. “I
am not come hither to reproach you. I am only the
bearer of good news.”
“I should like to hear some of that,” said the other
bitterly. “Where is it? Have you brought a loaded
pistol with you? That would be the most friendly action
you could do me just now, I believe.”
“Walter, you should not talk like that," answered
Arthur very gravely, for there was a. look in his friend’s
eyes which seemed to harmonise only too well with his
despairing words. “ When we kill ourselves so philoso-
phically, we forget how we wound others by that selﬁsh
act. Think of your mother, lad.”

“Yes. She would be sorry, would she not? ”
“It would break her heart, Walter; that’s all. And
besides, you have a wife now—yes, we all know it, and
you’re both forgiven—and why you have not written to
her in answer to the letter she wrote you, none of us can
imagine.”
“ I only got it this very day,” groaned Walter. “Am
I in a fit state to write upon business, think you P”
“ Business !” echoed Arthur contemptuoust ; “you’re
in a ﬁt state to take a cab to Mayfair, and ask your poor
wife’s pardon. I brought her up to her aunt’s house to-
(lay myself."
“ That’s well,” observed Walter reﬂectivcly ; “for be-
tween you and me, Arthur Haldane ”
“Well, what? ” exclaimed the barrister impatiently.
“Why, I think she’d better stay at her aunt’s house
altogether. The fact is, I’ve got no money to keep
her.”
“We know all about that, man——”
“The devil you do i” ejaculated Walter grimly;
“then bad news must indeed ﬁy apace. Look here,
Haldane— I’ve lost wary/ling. All that I have at
present; all that I was to have when I came of age;
all that I can expect from any human being who is fool
enough to leave me anything in time to come. I am a
beggar, and worse than that, for I am a defaulter, and
shall be proclaimed as such in a few days. That is the
whole state of the case. .Now, do you not think that
the kindest ofﬁce which a friend could do me, would be
to help me with the means of blowing out, what would
be in another man, his brains? For not only do I
recognise myself a scoundrel, but as a senseless dolt and
idiot, a fool of the ﬁrst quality, and a ”
“You must owe, then, near seven thousand pounds,”
interrupted Arthur, with something like a groan.
“Just about that, so far as I have dared to look the
thing in the face; all lost within twenty-four hours—most
of it within three minutes,”

“We must keep. this from your mother, somehow,
Walter. She has been sadly tried, and I doubt whether
she could bear it."
“She must know it sooner or later, man, even if she
doesn’t read it in the papers. When your Turf gentry
do not get paid, they make a noise about it, you see,
that being all they can do. I’ve a precious good mind
to take myself off to Cariboo—that’s where this fellow
Derrick made his money—the climate's good, and with a
little capital, one may do a good deal. Why should I
not go there, and never let them have a penny? The
law looks upon it as a swindle, you know that well
enough; and it was a swindle, by Jove! Come,
you’re a barrister, Haldane; now, what do you say
about it?"
“No, Walter, I cannot advise you to act in that
manner, and I am sure you did not propose it seriously
yourself."
“Oh no, certainly not; I was only having a bit of
fun,” rejoined the other bitterly. “I am just in the
humour for joking now, and can‘t resist it. Thousand
devils! would you have me go to the workhouse, man,
or where P ”
“Nothing of that sort is at all necessary, Walter,"
answered the other quietly. “Of course, I was not
prepared for this very unfortunate position of affairs; I
had brought news that, through, I must say, the very
generous behaviour of your elder brother, your income
as a married man would in future be a very tolerable
one; it has been made up to at least double what
the interest of the sum you have lost would have
produced. Thus, in addition to your pay, you would
have had about six hundred a year, besides whatever
your wife’s aunt might think proper to allow her.
Your mother, on the other hand, undertakes, if you
should scruple to accept this kindness at Sir Richard’s
hands ”
‘ “ Scruple? Certainly not,” ejaculated Walter angrily.

“ I confess that I did not think my'brother would have
had so much proper feeling, and I am much obliged to
him, of course; but, after all, he has only done his duty.
What is three hundred a year out of the Lisgard rent-
roll?"
“Still, he was not obliged to do it," observed Arthur
dril .
“yThat is true; and, of course, you take the lawyer’s
view of it. Moreover, when he comes to hear of these
debts, perhaps his Serene Highness may think proper to
withdraw his gracious assistance.” .
“You do him very wrong, Walter,” answered Arthur
with warmth. “Your trouble makes you say things
you ought to be ashamed of — yes, ashamed of.
Your brother, with all his faults, is incapable of com-
mitting such an act of cruelty. He is quite willing
that you should both return to Mirk as soon as you
please, but particularly that you should be present at
his coming of age, which I am sure you will not fail
to be. But if you will take my advice, you will not
make your position known at Mirk, for, as I have
said before, your mother has had enough to,trouble
her. You must let your sporting friends understand
it, however, and we must make the best arrangements
we can for your paying your debts within a year;
and for the future, till something turns up, instead
of six hundred per annum, you must manage to do
on three. Your wife, I am sure, is a most sensible
young lady, and will easily perceive the necessity for
economy." -
“Thank you,” answered the dragoon coldly. “Per-
haps you would like to run down to Canterbury, and.
choose our lodging for us ; or do you think we ought to
be content to live in barracks? I know that there is a
great temptation to insult a man when he is down ; but
for giving unpalatable advice in an offensive manner, I
do not know your equal, Mr. Arthur Haldane.”
“Well, Walter, I have said what I thought right, and

I do not intend to quarrel with you. I should wish, on
the contrary, to remain your friend, if it were only for
your dear mother’s sake—-—”
“ And somebody else's,” interrupted the captain with a.
sneer.
“Yes 3 for your sister Letty’s, Walter 3 I frankly own
that. Come, give us your hand, mam—Well, another
time, then, when you are more like yourself—But before
I go, I want to ﬁnd this man Derrick, for I have a letter
for him of importance from Mistress Forest."
“You had better ask as you go down stairs, Mr.
Haldane; I know nothing about him.” And with that,
Captain Walter Lisgard deliberately turned his back
upon his visitor, and looked gloomily out of the window;
while his white hand stroked his silken moustaches
as though it were a pumice-stone, and it was his inten-
tion to stroke them off.
Arthur made his inquiry of the servant who opened
the hall-door to let him out.
“Mr. Derrick—if that was the gentleman with the
large beard—had, come and gone within the last
quarter of an hour, while he (Haldane) had been
talking with the other gentleman up stairs. He had
called for his bill, and paid it, and packed his port-
manteau, and there it was in the passage at the present
moment."
“ Then he must come back for Mai,” exclaimed Arthur
eagerly.
“N 0. He had left directions that it was to be sent on
to him in a week or so to some place in the south. He i
had said that he should be walking, and therefore would
not be there himself for several days. He had taken a.
knapsack with him as for a regular tour. He was a
strange gentleman altogether."
Arthur Haldane stooped down, and read the address
on the portmanteau—Mr. R. Derrirk, Cor/clan; then
stepped very thoughtfully into the roaring street. “I
don’t know exactly why, and I certainly have no desire

to know,” muttered the young barrister to himself;
“but of all the bad news I have learned to-night, I
fear ma we‘re will consider this the worst. Why the
deuce should this fellow be going to Coveton, of all
places least calculated to attract such a scampish
vagabond? Coveton, Coveton—yes, that is the place
where my lady came ashore from the wreck of the

CHAPTER XXVI.
THE LETTER FROM PARIS.
> T is the morning after the Derby Day, and Sir
Richard, who has never had a shilling upon
that national event, yet reads with interest
the prose-poem upon the subject in the Times,
over the breakfast-table, and even favours Letty—which
is so unusual a piece of graciousness, that it almost
suggests the idea of making amends for something——
with extracts from the same, aloud. He and his sister
are alone at the morning meal, for my lady, as is often
the case now, has had her tea and dry toast sent up to
her in her own room, as also a couple of letters—one
from Arthur Haldane, and one with the Paris post-
mark, and in a foreign hand.
“Lord Stonart is said to have netted forty thousand
pounds : just think of that, Letty.”
“Yes, Richard; but then think of the poor people
that lost it.” _
“Poor people should not bet," returned the baronet
severely. “ I am sorry for Mr. Chifney, since, if he had
not quarrelled with his lordship, the winner would have
come out of his stables. As it was, he very nearly
accomplished it with that French horse llfezrelrzus—a
success which I should, as an Englishman, have much
deplored."

“ Dear me! was not that the horse in which Walter,
was so much interested? ”
“ I am sure I don’t know, Letty. I should think my
brother had no money to spare for the race-course, under
present circumstances: he could surely never be such a
fool."
“Very likely not, Richard. I never said a word about
his risking money ,- I only said he was ‘interested.’ ”
“Ah !" rejoined the baronet signiﬁcantly, “I dare
say ; ” and then he began to whistle, as was not unusual
with him when thoroughly displeased. Presently, how-
ever, recollecting that this was not a sociable sort of
thing to do, Sir Richard abruptly observed: “Mamma
had a letter from Paris this morning, and in aforeign
hand; Iwonder who her correspondent is. I do not
think she has heard from abroad since immediately after
our poor father’s death. Then I remember several of
her old French friends wrote'to her.”
“I hope it is no ill news of any kind, for I am getting
quite anxious about dear mamma, Richard. Ever since
Christmas last, she has seemed to get more and more
depressed. "
“ I have only observed it lately,” answered the baronet,
rather stiﬂ'ly ; “and I am sure we have not far to 100k for
the reason.—By-the-bye, there was a letter for her from
Arthur Haldane also."
“Oh I was there P ” said Letty carelessly, but turning
a lively pink. Then after a short pause, during which
the baronet resumed his paper: “If you will not have
another cup of coﬁee, Richard, I think I will go up and
see mamma.”
At that moment, the door opened, and my lady her-
self entered the room. Her cheeks were ashy pale, but
her eyes were beaming with excitement, and the hand in
which she held an open letter trembled as she spoke.
“Oh, I have got such good news, Richard !”
“What! from Arthur?” cried Letty. “Ah I I thought
he would arrange everything as it should be.”

Sir Richard frowned, and seemed about to speak, but
did not do so.
“Yes, I have heard from Arthur too,” said my lady;
“and very satisfactorily, although, perhaps, there may be
matters which may require my presence in town fora
day or two.”
“You may always command my services, mother: I
can start at ﬁve minutes’ notice,” said Sir Richard
gravely.
“ No, my dear boy; if I have to go at all—which is
not certain—I shall certainly go alone, or rather with
nobody but Mary. You will be full of preparations for
your ﬁle, I know, for one only comes of age once in
one’s lifetime; and besides, to tell you the truth, you
would be of no use at all.” Here she kissed him
tenderly, and pushed her ﬁngers through his brown
curls lingeringly, as though she was already wishing him
farewell. “But the good news I speak of is a much{
more selﬁsh affair than you dream of. I have had a
letter from my dear old friend, Madame de Castellan,
who used to be so good to me when I was no older than
you, Letty, at Dijon.”
“ I remember her,” said Sir Richard. “She came to
'.stay at the Abbey when I was about nine, did she not,
and took such a fancy to dear old Belcomb? She said
that she and I would marry as soon as I got old enough,
and set up an establishment in the little cottage. A
charming old lady, with snow-white hair, but a slight
deﬁciency of teeth." '
“Just so,” answered my lady. “She always vowed
she would have nothing false about her, as long as she
lived, and she is alive now, and apparently very hearty.
But she has had some money losses, as well as certain
domestic misfortunes, which induce her to seek an
entire change of life. It is a most singular thing that
you should have recollected her passion for Belcomb,
for it is about that very place that she 'has written. She
wishes to know whether she could be our tenant there,

at all events for the summer. The matter is in your
hands, Richard, or will be so in a week or two, but I
confess I should like to have her for a neighbour
exceedingly."
“Then by all means write and say ‘Come,’ ” cried
the baronet ; “and why not let her have Belcomb rent
free? I dare say she would not mind our having our
picnics there occasionally ; and it is really no loss to me,
for I don’t believe anybody but herself would dream of
taking it, except in the shooting season."
“Then that is arranged," answered my lady joyfully.
“I am to write by return of post,” she says 3 “and if
the letter says ‘Yes,’ that then we may expect her any
day. She will bring her own French maid; and I will
drive over to-day, and arrange about old Rachel and her
husband, who, of course, must be no losers, if they have
to leave. That must be Madame’s own affair, if she is
really to have the place for nothing. See how aﬁ'ec-
tionately the dear old lady writes, and what a. capital
hand, considering her advanced age !”
“Yes, indeed," said Sir Richard, elevating his eye-
brows : “only, to say the truth, I am not good at French
manuscript ”

“Although a master of that language, when in printed. I
books," interrupted Letty.
“Well, the fact is, they didn't teach that sort of thing
at Eton in my time,” answered the baronet frankly; “or,
at all events, they didn’t teach me. However, French is
not so bad as German, that I will say. One ail: pro-
nounce it without speaking from the pit of one’s
stomach.”
“ Yes, one can—after a fashion,” laughed Letty a little
scornfully; but her elder brother seemed resolved to
take all her bantering in good part that morning, as
the imperial lion will sometimes tolerate the gambols of
a companion kitten. “I don’t think, however," she
continued, “Madame de Castellan, who comes from
Paris, will quite understand you, Richard—How nicely

she speaks of Mary, mamma. Why, how comes she to
know so much about 110' f "
“Why, when I went to Dijon, before my marriage,
Mary Forest went with me, you know, and remained
there several years."
“Ah, yes, of course ; I had forgotten."
“ And when we were at the—the college," continued
my lady, with a slight tinge of colour, “Madame took
pity upon us both, being foreigners, and was kind to us
beyond all measure. Many a happy day have we passed
in her pretty chateau together; and indeed I think I
owe my Parisian pronunciation—of which you seem to
make so much, Letty—at least as much to Madame de
Castellan as to my paid teachers. She never could speak
English, if you remember, Richard; everything she ad-
dressed to you had to be translated."
“Dear me,” answered the baronet hastily, “I don’t
like that. I hope she has learned English since then.
It places one in a very humiliating position to be talked
to in a language one does not understand; unless you
can treat the person as a savage, which, to say the
truth, I always feel inclined to do."
“Well, Richard," said my lady smiling, “if I am not
at your elbow when Madame de Castellan calls, there
will be always Letty here, who is cunning in such
tongue-fence, to protect you; but, as a matter of fact,
we shall see my poor old friend but very seldom. She
is a good deal broken, I fear, by time, and still more by
trouble "—here my lady’s own voice began to quaver a
little—“and all she seems to desire is quiet and seclu-
sion, before her day of rest at last shall dawn."
“She will be very welcome," answered Sir Richard
tenderly. “I hope that you will cause everything for
her comfort to be looked to at Belcomb, and I will again
repeat my orders to Rinkel that the place is to be kept
quite free from trespassers.”
He rose and kissed his mother, then, as he left-the
room, delayed with his ﬁngers on the door-handle, saying:

“Have Walter and—and his wife consented to be present
at my coming of age ? ”
“ Certainly, dear Richard: they will both be very
pleased, to come—nay, Arthur thinks that they may re-
turn to the Abbey immediately. It is scarcely worth
while for them to take a house, or rather lodgings, at
Canterbury, since they are to be here so soon. Walter
has leave now, it seems, and there will be no difﬁculty in
getting it prolonged almost indeﬁnitely: he can do any-
thing he likes with his colonel, you know, as indeed "
“Exactly,” interrupted Sir Richard, drily. “Then I
suppose they will be back in a few days.” And with that
he placed the door between himself and the threatened
eulogy upon Master Walter.
“ Was there any particular message for me, mamma? "
inquired Letty, demurely.
“From Walter? No, dear. He sent his love to us
all ; but of course he feels a little embarrassed, and
perhaps scarcely understands that he has been forgiven.
Oh, I forgot : you meant was there any particular message
from Arthur Haldane, you exacting little puss! Why, he
only left us yesterday morning! But don’t be vexed, my
darling. You have won the love of a man who knows your
worth almost as well as I do. He may not be so brilliant
or so handsome as our darling Walter—and indeed who
is P—but'I must say he has shown much better taste in
choosing a wife. He has both wisdom and goodness,
my darling child, and I ﬁrmly believe your future happi-
ness is assured.”
“Yes, dearest mother, I do believe it; but
Here Letty’s eyes began not only to sparkle, but to
distil pearls and diamonds in the most lavish and ap-
parently uncalled-for profusion.
“Why, what is the matter now, my love?” inquired
my lady.
“ Nothing, mamma—nothing at least that I should
have thought it worth while to tell you, had I not been
overcome by your kind words. I know you have got

troubles enough of your own ; I did not mean to tell
you, indeed I did not; I tried to forget it myself. Only
last night, after you had gone to bed, Richard sat up with
me talking about his future, and it seems he has made
some plan for mine. He spoke of Mr. Charles Vane as
a person he would like to have for a brother-in-law. He
bade me be particularly civil to him at the coming file,
and when I said that I did not very much care about Mr.
Vane—and, in fact, that I had already Oh, mamma,
Richard said some very cruel things. He reminded me
that one member of the family had already made a dis-
reputable marriage ”
“ That was an ungenerous speech, and very unlike my
Richard,” interposed my lady, with emphasis. “Why,
he would have married Rose himself.”
“ So I have sometimes thought,” replied Letty, simply :
“but to do him justice, I think he was referring to the
clandestine character of the marriage rather than to the
match itself. However, when he used the word disre-
putable in connection with Arthur Haldane, he made me
very angry, I own. I told him that Arthur was worth all the
Vanes that had ever been born, whether there might have
been nineteen generations of them (as‘ he boasted) Or a
hundred and ninety. And I am afraid, dear mamma,
that I snapped my ﬁngers, and said that I did not care
Mat, when he accused dearest Arthur of not having a great-
grandfather. At all events, Richard stalked out of the
drawing-room vastly oﬂ'ended; and although he has been
endeavouring to be extra civil to me this morning, I
know that it is only that he may again introduce the very
objectionable subject of Mr. Charles Vane ; and when I
say ‘No’ with decision, as of course I shall do, I fear
that he may take it upon himself to write to Arthur ; and
then, dearest mother, the Haldanes are so proud, you
know, that I don’t know what may happen.”
Strange as it may seem, there had ﬁitted across my
lady’s face during this recital a look of something like
relief—for it surely could not have been satisfaction—

but it speedily gave place to that expression of distress
that had become only too habitual to her once serene
and corner features. Perhaps, 'accustomed to mischance
as she now was, she had expected even more unwelcome
news, and had felt momentarily thankful matters were no
worse ; but now all was gloom again.
“ You were quite right to tell me this, Letty, even
though it does give me a new cause for grief. ' If I know
Arthur Haldane, he will not desert his betrothed wife on
account of any slight that may be put upon him by any
other human being. You maybe quite at ease about that,
I am very sure. But these dissensions and disagree-
ments among my own children—I know it is not your
fault, dear Letty—but I feel that I cannot bear up under
them. You will not have me with you here much
longer.”
“ Oh, mamma—dear, dear mamma, how selﬁsh it was
of me thus to aﬁlict you further. But don’t, don’t talk
like that. What should we do without you—you the sole
bond that unites your boys together : and I 9 Oh,
_ mother, what would become of me? You don't know
how_ I love you.”
“Yes, darling, I do. You are tender-hearted as you
are dutiful. And my boys, to do them justice, they love
me too; but they are wearing me into my grave. At
least, I feel it would be far better if I were lying
there.”
“Oh, mamma, mannna," sighed Letty, covering my
lady’s tearful face with kisses, “ you will break my heart
if you talk so."
“ You will have somebody better able to take care of
you even than I, clear child, when I am gone. AndI
will see that it is so. Yes, I will leave directions behind
me—you will ﬁnd them in my desk, Letty; remember
this, should anything happen to rue—about that matter as
well as other things. Richard will respect my wishes in
such a case, I know, and will offer no opposition."
“ But, dearest mother, do you feel ill?" cried Letty in

us send for the doctor from Dalwynch. How I wish that
Arthur’s father could be prevailed on to come and see

“ Dear child, dear child l” sobbed my lady. “ It will
be a bitter parting indeed for both of us—when the time
comes. Perhaps it may not be so near at hand as I
feared. In the meantime, rest assured, love, that ifI feel
adoctor can do me any good, he shall be sent for at
once. But it is the mind, and not the body, which has
need of medicine—There, dry your eyes, and let ushope

CHAPTER XXVII.
MADAME DE CASTELLAN.
g‘ PON the fourth day after the reception _of her
I ) Paris letter, my lady had to leave Mirk for
, w ,4- town on business connected with Walter's
aﬁ'airs—for, after all, she cannot permit his
elder brother to bear the whole brunt of these unexpected
expenses. Her visit was to the family lawyer, and she
went alone save for the attendance of Mistress Forest.
Under any circumstances, she would rather it were thus,
she repeats, even if the preparations going on at Mirk
did not take up so fully Sir Richard’s time, and render
his accompanying her out of the question. For this
coming of age was a case wherein surely a man might
busy himself even though the whole aﬁair was to be held
in his own honour; the very name of Lisgard being in a
manner at stake, and obnoxious to censure, if everything
should not be in a ﬁtting scale and perfect of its kind;
nay (though certainly more remotely), might not the
great principle of T erritorial Aristocracy have been
almost said to be upon its trial upon the coming occasion ?
The business must have been pressing indeed, remarked
the baronet alittle pointedly, that took the mistress of
Mirk from home at such an important epoch; and he
thought in his heart that his mother might have put off
this signature of a few parchments until after the fete-day.
However, it was plain that my lady considered the call to

town imperative, since she started thither upon the very
morning of the day on which her old friend Madame de
Castellan had appointed to reach Belcomb; and although
she hoped to be able to return on the ensuing afternoon,
in company with Walter and his wife, whose marriage had
been in the meantime publicly announced, it was not
certain that her affairs could be transacted within such
time as would permit her to do so. And so it un-
fortunately turned out. About an hour after luncheon,
the carriage having been despatched from the Abbey to
Dalwynch station just so long as would admit of its
return with its expected inmates, the sound of wheels was
heard in the avenue, and both Sir Richard and Letty felt
the colour come into their cheeks, Each imagined that it
was the Return of the Prodigal (in this case rendered
more embarrassing by the fact of his bringing his wife with
him). Suppose their mother should have been prevented
from accompanying Captain and Mrs. Lisgard! How
very awkward and disconcerting would this ﬁrst interview
be; and especially for the poor baronet, who had never
seen Rose, at least to his own knowledge, as a married
woman. His brother’s bride too ! Sir Richard rather re-
pented for that minute or too that he had made such a
point of the young couple returning to Mirk so soon.
He felt quite grateful tolhis sister when she placed her
hand upon his arm, and whispered : “ Had we not better
go out to meet them, Richard?” At any other time, he
would perhaps have resented her offer to share the duties
of host; for was it not his place, and his alone, to bid
guests welcome to Mirk Abbey? But upon this oc-
casion he accepted it gladly; and it was lucky for him
he did.
Instead of the gay harouche and glistening steeds from
his own stables, he beheld, when he reached the hall
steps, the Dalwynch ﬂy—for the little town only boasted
of one such conveyance—a yellow single-seated machine,
which had once been proud to call itselfa post-chaise, and
been whirled through the air by panting wheelers and

leaders; but it was now dragged along by animals so
melancholy and slow, that but for their colour and short-
ness of tail, they might have been hearse-horses; while
the driver had a lugubrious expression too, as beﬁtted one
who felt that he should never buckle on his single spur
again, or crack his whip in triumph. as he came up the
street of the county town at a hand-gallop. But the
tenant of this vehicle was a far more old-world-looking
Object than itself or its belongings,- a very ancient and
silvery-haired lady, looking almost double even as she
sat, and only able, painfully, to alight from her carriage by
aid of , Mr. Robert’s arm and a crutched stick. Her
complexion was an agreeable gingerbread,- she had not
above three teeth, which, however, were very white ones,
left in eitherjaw; and her head shook from side to side
with the palsy of extreme old age. But despite these dis-
advantages, she had by no means an unpleasant ex-
pression ; and Sir Richard, with his féteday running in
his head, was somehow reminded of one of those bene-
ﬁcent old fairies, who, at considerable personal incon-
venience, used to make a point of being present at the
christening, marriage, and other important occasions in
the life of the young prince with whose royal mother they
-had been such great friends in years gone by. He hurried
down the steps to offer his arm to this strange visitor, and
bid her respectful welcome.
“Madame de Castellan, for I think it can be no one
else,” said he 3 “it is most kind of you to treat us thus.
We ought to have been at Belcomb ourselves by this
time, instead of your being here, and indeed we should
have been there yesterday, had my mother been at
home 3 but important business has taken her to London,
and I much regret to say that she has not even yet re-
turned, although we are expecting her every minute."
Either the exertion of alighting, or the reception of this
unexpected news, set the poor old lady shaking to that
degree, that it seemed a wonder that she did not shake
to pieces. She fell to kissing Letty, doubtless partly from

aﬂection, but also perhaps as an excuse for not im-
mediately commencing the ascent of those dreadful
status.
“You don't either of you remember me, I dare say,"
mumbled she in the French tongue.
Sir Richard smiled and bowed, as being the safest
reply he could frame to a question of which he under-
stood nothing.
“Ah, Heaven, he does!” cried the old lady with
evident delight. “This is an excellent young man 3 and
yet he was but a very little boy. And Miss Letty ? N 0,

his black velvet frock and short sleeves tied with scarlet
ribbon—where was he ? What ! grown up and married ?
Was it possible? How time had ﬂown ,' alas, alas! And
the good Dr. Haldane and his wife, was he here as much
as usual? clever, sarcastic little gentleman I"
Not even the allusions to their own childhood gave
Richard and his sister so vast a notion of the time that
had elapsed since Madame de Castellan’s previous visit
to the Abbey, as this last remark of hers ; for the occur-
rence which had shut out the good doctor from the
Abbey had happened so long ago that it was almost‘
legendary ; and they were so accustomed to his absence,
that they could not picture to themselves the state of
things to which this patriarchal old lady referred as a
matter of course. As for Mrs. Haldane, they had heard
of the existence of such a person, and that was all. That
good woman had not made much noise in the world
when she was alive, and she had been among the silent
now for more than eleven years. How far back were the
explanations to begin, thought Letty and her brother,
that would make this female Rip Van Winkle nu fail
with the present order of things?
But the old Frenchwoman was fortunately not nearly
so anxious to be answered as she was to talk, a feat
which she accomplished with much more distinctness

than could have been expected, notwithstanding that Sir
Richard subsequently ascribed to her paucity of teeth the
fact that he only understood about two words out of her
every ﬁve.
. It was very amusing to watch the poor young baronet
listening with fruitless diligence to her rapid syllables,
and then turning an imploring glance upon his sister and
sworn interpreter for aid and rescue. He was obliged
upon two occasions to frame some halting reply with his
own lips ,' once when Madame openly complimented him
upon his good looks and gallant bearing; and secondly,
when she thanked him for the readiness with which he
had placed the cottage at Belcomb at her disposal ; but
for the rest, the burden of conversation rested upon
Lett .
“ yAnd how is Marie—how is the good Marie, who was to
your dear mamma like a servant and a sister in one ? ”
asked the old lady, when they had got her with some
difﬁculty into the drawing-room.
“She is well, Madame; but in some trouble about a
certain suitor, whom ” (here she pouted a little) “Sir
Richard here considers to be undesirable.”
Madame raised her rather shaggy eyebrows, and looked
towards the young baronet as if for an explanation. He
knew that they were speaking of Mistress Forest, and
that was all.
“ An admirable person," said he earnestly ; “most
trustworthy in every way. We have all cause to be more
than satisﬁed.”
“Ah, then he does not object after all!” exclaimed
Madame triumphantly.—“ And Master Walter—what sort
of a wife has he got? Beautiful? That is well ; it would
be a pity if it were otherwise. And clever? Excellent !
And also good, I hope? "
“Well, Madame, she will be here in a minute, so that
you may judge for yourself,” answered Letty smiling, but
by no means displeased to hear the craunch of carriage-
wheels upon the gravel of the terraced drive. These

home questions concerning her new sister-in-law were
getting rather difﬁcult to answer, and especially in
Richard’s presence.
“Will your mother he with them i‘ ” inquired Madame,
gathering from the faces of her companions, rather than
from any sound which could have reached her tardy cars,
that the arrival of those expected was imminent.
“As I said before, Madame, I cannot promise; but I
sincerely trust, for your sake—as, indeed, for her own-
that it may be so. I am sure mamma will deeply grieve
to have missed you."
The next moment, Captain and Mrs. Lisgard were
announced. Richard walked straight up to Rose, and
taking her hand in his best Sir Roger de Coverley manner,
bade her frank but stately welcome. Then, “How are
you, Walter?” said he, giving his brother’s ﬁngers an
earnest squeeze, and simulating cordiality all he could.
“ Here is a very old friend of our mother’s, Madame de
Castellan, who remembers you in a velvet frock with
short sleeves and cherry-coloured ribbons.”
For the ﬁrst time, Sir Richard blessed this old lady’s
presence, which was so greatly mitigating to him the
diﬁieulties of this dreaded interview; but Walter appeared
to be but little embarrassed; less so, indeed, than
Madame herself, who, overcome, doubtless, by the strong
resemblance to his mother in the young man now pre-
sented to her, began .to tremble again almost as much as
she had done a while ago.
“And this is Master Walter,” said she in broken tones.
“I think I should have known that without any introduc-
tion.” Here she held him with both her hands at arms'
length. “I suppose, now, you do not remember me at
all ? ”
“Madame,” returned the young man in bad French,
but briskly enough, and with a very pleasant smile, “ I
cannot say I do. Little folks in velvet frocks have very
bad memories. But I have often heard my dear mother
speak of you most affectionately; indeed she wrote to me

of your expected arrival at Belcomb with greater pleasure
than I have known her to take in anything for years.”
“Except your marriage, Mister the Captain, eh?” re-
turned the old lady arehly. “Come, introduce me to
your lovely bride. Ah, Heaven, what a young couple!
Well, I like to see that—I who might be the great-grand-
mother of both of you.—How are you, Madame Walter ?
What do they call you? Rose ! Ah, a charming
name.”
But though the name was so charming, and the young
lady was so lovely, Madame de Castellan did not take
her to her arms and embrace her as she had taken Letty.
Indeed, if it was possible for Rose to look disconcerted,
she would have done'so now, as she stood with cast-
down eyes, exposed to the same steady scrutiny as her
husband had just been subjected to ; but there was by
no means so much aﬁection in the old lady’s gaze on
this occasion. When she had regarded her suﬁiciently,
she dismissed her with a patronising tap upon the head,
and once more addressed herself to Walter. “ And what
have you done with your mamma, Sir? "
“I have done nothing, Madame,” answered he laugh-
ing. “She has never given me the chance of making
away with her, if it is of that you suspect me ; for she
never came to see us in town at all. We were to meet
at the station this morning, but she was not there. I am
afraid, therefore—for she dislikes travelling at night—
that we shall not see her before this time to-morrow."
Master Walter was in very different cue from that in
which we saw him last. The burden of his difﬁculties
had been lifted from his shoulders, at all events for the
present. He had been saved at least from ruin, and
that, though he might be henceforth compelled to live the
life of a poor man, was a matter of congratulation; just
as one is thankful, in shipwreck upon the desolate seas,
to land on even a barren rock. His spirits were always
buoyant, and they were now asserting themselves after a
period of severest pressure. In short, Master Walter was

as well ﬁtted to please all with whom he came into con-
tact. It was plain that he had made a complete conquest
of this old Frenchwoman.
“And Marie, have you hidden her anywhere, you
naughty boy P ”
“ Not I, Madame. If you saw her, you would under-
stand that she is not easily hidden. You remember her
plump, I dare say; but plump is now no word for her.
Even love—and she is love-sick, poor thing, at ﬁve-and-
forty, or so—does not render her less solid.”
“Ah, wicked, to laugh at love 1 " replied the old lady,
holding up a reproving ﬁnger, of whose shape and white-
ness she was evidently proud, and not altogether without
reason 3 “and worse still, to laugh at Marie. I love that
dear Mistress Forest ; and mind you, tell mamma, if ever
she parts with her, that she is to come straight to me. What
would I not give for a waiting-maid like that—devoted,
prudent, to whom I could conﬁde my little love-aﬂ'airs 1
—-Why do you laugh, rude children ? It is, I see, time
that I should go.—Seriously," continued she, when the
chorus of dissatisfaction had died away (for everyone
except, perhaps, Rose, was pleased with this sprightly old
lady, and all felt her presence to be, under the circum-
stances, an immense relief), “I must be going home at
once. Thank you kindly, Sir Richard, but to stay to
dinner is impossible. The night-air, at my time of life-—
more even than ‘ﬁve-or-forty or so,‘ Mister the Captain
—is very unwholesome. You must all come and lunch
with me shortly. A ﬁle champ?!” upon the—what is it
you call it P—Lisgard Folly. You will give this kiss to
mamma for me, Miss Letty, and tell her I must see her

will not have any of you young people on that day. I
shall wish to talk to her alone about so many things.

love with him—Adieu to you, naughty boy—Now, Sir
Richard, if you will give me your arm, by the time we
get to the front door, and down these dreadful steps, the
mom/1e will be at the door, though he walk slow, as
though he had just escaped out of treacle.”
As the pair made their way to the hall, at the pace of
chief-mourners, Madame de Castellan, to Richard’s sur-
prise and joy, began, for the ﬁrst time, to speak in broken
English. “Your mother is very fond of you all,” said
she ; “I hope you are fond of her."
“I hope so indeed, Madame: we should be very un-
grateful if we were not.”
“That is well, young man. Be good to her, for our
mothers are obliged to leave us, you know, long before
we go ourselves."
“ God forbid, Madame, that we should lose her these
many years,” answered the baronet fervently.
“Yes, yes ; but mind this,” answered the old lady
testily, as she climbed into the mow/w, “that if Mistress
Forest should want a place—here am I at Belcomb, very
glad to receive her. Good-bye."
Sir Richard, thunder-struck, stared at the slowly-de-
parting vehicle like one in a dream. “I never heard
such a speech," soliloquised lie—“never. Can that old
harridan be really calculating upon my mother’s death
giving her a new lady’s-maid? How selﬁsh is extreme
old age! I could not have believed it possible. How it
would have distressed mamma, could she have heard her. _
And yet but for that speech, she seemed an affectionate
and kindly old creature enough. I have often heard that
Frenchwomen have no hearts, but only manners—and I
suppose that so it is.”

CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE PARTIE QUARRE.
'1' S Walter had predicted, my lady did not return
1 to Mirk by the evening train, and scarcely
under any circumstances could her absence
have been more keenly felt. The four young
folks at home were by no means so socially comfortable
as a partie quarré is proverbially said to be. They felt
themselves embarrassed even when all together ; but
when the couples were left alone, the gentlemen over the
dessert, and the ladies in the drawing-room, their position
was tenfold more awkward. If they had not been so
nearly connected, the one might have taken refuge in
conversation about the weather or politics, and the other
in books or bonnet-shapes ; but one of the many disad-
vantages of near relationship is, that you are cut oil" from
all havens of that sort. The device is too transparent to
be adopted or acquiesced in—each was conscious that
the other was thinking of all sorts of unpleasant things,
and wishing his companion at Jericho—or York at least.
The temperature was so mild that there was not even a.
ﬁre to poke.
“ You remember this claret, Walter, I dare say.”
“ Yes ; did not our father reckon it the next best in his.

from the Abbey was not likely to produce forgetfulness

upon this particular point more than upon any other.
Sir Richard did not venture to propose a cigar 1n the
smoking-room; they sat on either side of the empty grate
making a great pretence of enjoying their wine (which
might have been ginger-beer, for any gratiﬁcation it
afforded them) and racking their brains for something to
say. At last Walter blurted out with a great show of
frankness: “Richard, you were quite right about that
fellow Derrick ; I wish I had taken your view of the man 5
he has let me in for a good deal of money this Derby."
“ I am sorry for that," returned the other, with genuine
pleasure. “Yes, I knew he was a bad lot. I hope,
however, he has now left Mirk for good and all.”
“No ; he'll come back after Mary F0rest, I have no
doubt ; and I am afraid I was partly to blame in helping
him in that quarter. But he knows what I think of him
now."
“I am glad of it,” said the baronet drily.
“ Nice, conciliating, agreeable companion this is,"
soliloquiscd Walter; “I think I see myself making any
second admission of having been wrong where he was
right.” His self-humiliation, however,'had not been al-
together without an object.
“ Yes ; I lost a considerable sum—that is, considerable
for me—through this gentleman from Cariboo," continued
the captain. “ It is all in train for being settled—I am
not going to ask you, Richard, for another shilling. I am
sure you have been already extremely generous—very
much so. But the money can’t be paid for a few months 3
and there is one rascal—an infernal Jew fellow—who,
instead of replying to my letter, offering him very hand-
someterms, I am sure, has had the impertinence, I see,
to write to mamma.”
“A Jew fellow write to my mother!” exclaimed Sir
Richard, with an indignant emphasis upon the personal
pronoun.
“I am afraid so. I am almost sure I recognise his
horrid handwriting upon this envelope."

He took down one of several letters upon the mantel-
piece that had arrived that morning for the mistress of the
house, and were awaiting her return.
“You see he knows I’m under age, and he thinks to
frighten one’s people into immediate payment by threaten-
ing all sorts of things which he cannot really put into
effect, but which will alarm mamma very much indeed.
It's a common trick.”
“Oh, indeed; I am not acquainted with the ways of
such people myself. And what is it you propose to do,
\Valter ? ”
“ Well, I don’t think my mother should see that letter
at all. He is not a sort of person—the beggar, you see,
spells ‘ Abbey ’ without an e—for a lady to have anything
to do with.”
“_Nor a gentleman either, as I should think," observed
the baronet severely. “But I do not perceive how we
can prevent this mischief. You cannot open the letter,
nor destroy it, of course.”
“N o, of course not," assented Walter, though with the
air of a person who had only been very recently con-
vinced of the impossibility.
Sir Richard took the objectionable missive between his
ﬁnger and thumb. 722 1/1: Hmueral'le Lady Lisgard,

What a deal of trouble this fellow Walter was causing!
Of course, one did not wish one’s brother any harm, but
what a nice thing it would be if one could get him some
appointment in the colonies. New Zealand was said to
be very salubrious, and had an excellently conducted
church establishment: the last mail, too, had brought
home (for the eleventh time) the joyful news that the
Maories were ﬁnally subjugated.
“ A perfect savage,” observed Walter, with reference to
Mr. Moss Welcher Abrahams.
“And yet with some good points,” argued the baronet,
his thoughts still lingering in the antipodes.
“I’m hanged if I ever heard of them, then,” replied

his brother with irritation. “He's a black-leg and a
usurer. I’d never have bet with such an infernal
scoundrel, only that he offered me half a point more than
the odds."
“Ah,” returned Sir Richard, with all the expressiveness
that is attributed to the “Ugh” of the North American
Indian. “ Suppose we join the ladies."
I do not pretend to narrate how Rose and Letty had
passed their time since dinner. No grown-up male—with
the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Anthony Trollope, whom
I have heard ladies say has actually described the thing
—can picture the mysteries that take place in the draw-
ing-room before the gentlemen come in. Do they tell
stories, I wonder, like the folks in the dining-room?
Now and then something incidentally crops up which
induces me to think they do ; but there is no absolute
proof. When I was a very little boy, and there chanced
' to be a dinner-party at home, after having had my half-
glass of wine—“ up to the cut,” I remember, was the
niggardly phrase—it was my invariable custom to leave
the dining-room when the ladies did ; and well I recollect
how my elder brother used playfully to ﬂick my un-
protected legs with his dinner-napkin, as I closed the
petticoated procession. But memory often retains what
is least worth keeping, and loses that which is truly
valuable. If I had only known that it would be my
future mission to write stories, I should doubtless have
not so neglected my opportunities in the drawing-room.
But at that time I looked forward to be a merchant en-
gaged in the diamond business, and realising thousands
of purses of sequins by trafﬁc with the natives of Bagdad
and Bassorah. Indeed, upon these very after-dinner
occasions I used to be taken upon somebody’s lap, and
entertained with anecdotes of that charming profession,
the members of which were exposed to no vulgar
bankruptcies; but if they escaped from the mighty
Roc (which was a bird) and from the loadstone island
(which drew all the nails out of their argosies), were

certain to live happy ever afterwards with some beauti-
ful princess, who did not scorn to ally herself with
trade. Alas! the tongue is withered now that spoke
such magic, and the kind hand that fondled my childish
curls is dissolved in dust; and it is like enough that
all the rest of the gay company is dead except that
little boy. No ; I remember nothing of it, except that
the older ladies, and especially the married ones, used
to herd together, and interchange what I took to be
secret and important communications; and that the
young ones seemed to get after a while a little tired
of one another (notwithstanding that they were par-
ticularly civil and affectionate), and turned expectant
glances toward the door.
They could not, however, have been more pleased to
see the gentlemen than Rose and Letty were upon that
evening in Mirk drawing-room to welcome the two
brothers. Much as women are praised for their superior
tact, it is my humble opinion that they possess less of it
than ourselves. Their gentleness, beauty, and general
attractiveness enable them, it is true, to render certain
rough places tolerably smooth—nay, some almost im-
pregnable passes very practicable; but considering their
great advantages, they often signally fail in a piece of
social engineering, the difﬁculties of which almost any
man would have managed to evade. They prefer cut-
ting a tunnel through granite to deviating a hairbreadth
from the line they have marked out for themselves.
How often has one sat on tenter-hooks, listening to a
woman who raises a domestic breeze to storm, when
anybody but herself (who has yet been married to the
than a score of years) can perceive both drum and cone
mast-high in her husband’s face and manner; ay, when
you, the spectator, have marked half-a~dozen openings——
only she wz'll charge with her head down in that foolish
manner—by which she could have approached her con-
sort’s heart in the course of discussion, and got all she
wanted, and yet let him keep his temper. When a man

happens to have some feminine gifts, tenderness, grace,
beauty—like Walter Lisgard, for instance—what power
of pleasing, what avoidance of all subjects of derpleasure,
he almost always exhibits, notwithstanding his mascu-
line selﬁshness. It is very possible, indeed, that this
young dragoon may not have captivated my readers; but
that is because it is not possible to convey, by any de-
scription, the attributes which make such a man so
popular. Men talk of the nameless charm that hangs
about some fair one, her unspeakably winning manners,
and the grace “beyond expression ” that pervades her
being; but the inﬂuence of such a charmer is almost
entirely conﬁned to the other sex. She cannot compel
adoration from her young-lady friends: not solely be-
cause she is their successful rival, but partly because
she does not possess the art of winning them. She
has not the tact to conceal her superiority, to con-
ciliate their prejudices, to win their friendship. Now,
Walter Lisgard, who was of course adored by women,
was almost as popular with men. There were half-a-
dozen or so of people—among whom were Ralph
Derrick and Arthur Haldane—who had seen him under
circumstances of extreme annoyance, and had been
disenchanted of the smiling, kindly boy. There was Sir
Richard too—but there were reasons enough why Walter
should not possess his brother’s good-will, and having
failed to win it, it was the nature of such a man to be
embarrassed in his presence. Dislike, nay, even want of
appreciation, will often paralyse the most agreeable of
our fellow-creatures, and make them duller than those
who are at all times equally tedious. But if Walter had
been in Rose’s place, I think he would have managed to
get on better than she did in that tiled-tile with her pec-
cant sister-in-law. N o woman can conceal her annoyance
from its object, if that be a person of her own sex; she
can only be desperately civil.
At all events, husband and brother were received by
these two young ladies as though they had been their

lovers; and then the tea came up, itself a diversion,
which they prolonged to an inordinate limit. Who is so
fortunate that he has never been compelled to tea.
against time! The dinner-hour at the Abbey, however,
in consonance with ancient county habits, was a some-
what early one—six o’clock—and there was a consider-
able amount of evening to be got through. Sir Richard,
in these terrible straits, proposed a game at whist, and
the four accordingly sat down at' the velvet card-table—
scarcely ever used at Mirk—the gentlemen to contend
for shilling points, and the ladies for postage-stamps.
Mr. Charles Lamb has informed us that he is inclined to
think that there may be such a thing as sick w/u'rt; and
if that admirable humorist had witnessed this particular
rubber, he would have had his suspicions conﬁrmed.
Poor Walter thought grimly of his last experience in
that way with the Landraz'ls, and could not help making
an estimate of how many cycles of years it would take
him, with average luck, to win back the money lost upon
that occasion at the present stakes. Immersed in this
calculation, he made a series of infamous blunders, for
which Letty, who was, of course, his partner, reproved
him with that unsparing severity which this delightful
science induces even in an angelic partner: it is at the
whist-table that the trodden worm will turn with the
most energetic writhings. Sir Richard, on the other
hand (who scarcely ever ventured upon any ﬁnesse
except that of Ace, Queen,) was put in the highest
spirits, and became as offensively triumphant as his
chivalric nature would permit. Rose, poor girl, sincerely
bewailed her husband’s vanishing shillings, of which she
knew he had no superﬂuity, and would have trumped
her partner’s best card half-a-dozen times over, had she
but dared. Altogether, it was the dreariest of domestic
evenings.
The morning that followed was not much better; and
never did mother receive a sincerer welcome from her
offspring than did Lady Lisgard upon her return. The

love-light danced in her eyes for a little at their genuine
enthusiasm, but it soon died out, and they all observed
how tired and worn she looked, how much more white
and wan than when she had started from home. If Sir
Richard had had the opportunity, I almost think he
would have now acted upon his brother’s suggestion, and
spared his mother the sight of Mr. Moss Abrahams’ letter.
But it was too late. Letty had herself taken possession
of it: and when the ﬁrst greetings were over, and all
had had their say about the visitor of the day before,
she put it into her mother’s hand along with the other
missives.
“ I don’t know who your correspondents may be, (lear
mamma, but I should recommend one of them to apply
to that gentleman who promises in the Timer newspaper
to teach everybody a legible hand for four-and-sixpence ;
and when he has done that, he might learn a little spell-
ing, such as A, 6, ab; II, c, y, bay—Abbey.”
“I dare say it will wait till I go up stairs,” said my
lady with a faint smile; and she did not even look at it.
Nay, when she had reached her room, and was alone
with her maid, although she turned the letter round and .
round with hurried, anxious ﬁngers, she did not open it
even then, but gave it to Mistress Forest, saying piteously ;
“ I am not sure about the handwriting. Is it his, or no,
Mary?”
“ It is not his, Madam.”
“Thank Heaven for that!” cried my lady, breaking
the vulgar, sprawling seal, and rapidly possessing herself
of the contents. “ More trouble,” sighed she. “And
yet, why should I sigh? this is only another reason to
add to the budget in yonder desk for what I am about
to do.”
“That is well, dear Madam, and bravely said.”
answered the waitingmaid. “It is no use to court
delay. Sooner or later, the blow must fall ; if not to-day,
then tomorrow. If he does not write, be sure, my lady,
that he will come himself; we must make up our minds.

for that. He cannot go to Coveton, and see my father'
—which is what I feel he intends to do—without dis-
covering all; and since that must be, the sooner he does
so the better. We are now prepared for the worst—for
everything, in short, except suspense."
“ That is true," returned my lady wearily. “Heaven
help us l"
“Amen!” exclaimed Mistress Forest encouragineg ;
“ and I both hope and believe it will.”

CHAPTER XXIX.
A JOURNEY ON FOOT.
OME men, when crossed or “put out," take,
‘ like Sir Richard Lisgard, to whistling melodies
——surely a very mild and harmless form of
irritation. Others rap out a thunder-clap of
an oath or two, which leaves their ﬁrmament as serene
as ever. Nothing, again, can calm the wrath of some
folks but pedestrian exercise ; ghost-wise, they take to
“walking,” and gradually their angry passions exude.
This last was the case with Mr. Ralph Derrick, Mariner
and Gold-digger. When deeply annoyed, and some
exceptional barrier existed to his throwing the weightiest
substance that happened to be at hand at the head of
his enemy, or burying some lethal weapon in his vitals,
Ralph took to walking like the Wandering Jew. With
the ﬁrst stage or two, his thoughts were busy with the
insult, real or imaginary, which had been put upon him ;
his teeth were set, his ﬁngers clenched, his brows were
corrugated ; then he began to swing his loaded stick, not
viciously, but after the manner of an Irishman at a fair ;
and eventually that calisthenic exercise, combined
with the healthy inﬂuence of fresh air, restored him
to that normal state of devil-may-care, which per-
sons of charity go so far as to term, in folks of the
like description, good-humour. Of course, one cannot
help pitying this poor fellow, for he is one of those

persons who always look much better on paper than in
real life, just the reverse of which is the case with the
Walter Lisgards 3 but as a matter of fact, he is not only
a “rough customer,” but a very dangerous and reckless
man. Because we have seen him behave towards that
graceless captain of dragoons in a very generous and
high-ﬂown manner, it is not to be supposed that he was
always capable of magnanimous actions. That young
gentleman had been his pet, and it had suited his mood
to spoil him. A man may not only be agreeable to an
individual or two, but an excellent father, or a pattern
husband, and yet be a most oﬂensive fellow-creature to
you and to me. But it was certainly hard upon Ralph
that the only man for whom be entertained a genuine
aﬁ‘ection, should have turned out such an ungrateful
scamp. The treatment he had lately received at that
young man’s hands, the knavery of Mr. Jack Withers,
and the more than suspected collusion of his late com-
rade, Mr. Blanquette, united to put him out of humour
with the world. His previous opinions, as imported
from Cariboo, before he met with Walter, that everybody
was more or less of a scoundrel, had met with the
amplest conﬁrmation. He was more determined to take
his own way than ever, and let them look to it that
crossed him.
Bitter, indeed, had been his thoughts as he had been
borne along with that rabble rout on foot from Epsom
Downs. Deceived by those whom he had trusted, in-
sulted by him whom he had loved, and robbed of three-
fourths of that wealth, to which he now ascribed a
greater importance than ever, as the summmn banum,
and indeed the only good thing that was worth gaining,
he had but stopped in London a suﬁicient time to
pack up his scanty wardrobe, then started off again
on foot once more, as we have seen. Disgusted with
the Turf, as with all else he had recently had to do With,
he was now more than ever bent upon leading a new life
-—not, indeed, in a penitential sense (although some are

so audacious as to aver that it is a kind of mortiﬁcation),
but, in other words, to marry. Mistress Forest was as
fond of him, he thought, and with some justice, as any
woman was ever likely to be; and he was resolved not
to be balked of her by the machinations of Sir Richard
Lisgard, or the cajolements of his mother. After the
payment of all his bets, he would yet have left a sum
that to one in Mary's position would seem considerable ;
for he could sell Many Laws, after his recent per-
formance, for a great deal of money, to the half of
which he rather suspected Mr. Blanquette would never
venture to lay claim. Yes; he would go down to the
place where she had told him her father still dwelt, and
would dazzle him with such offers as could scarcely fail
to induce him to add the weight of his authority to his
own proposals; and there being no particular hurry
about the matter, and, as I have said, walking being
consonant to his feelings when in wrath, Ralph Derrick
had taken the road to Coveton on foot.
It was a long distance, and would have involved several
days of such travel, under any circumstances, and he did
not hurry himself at all. At many a wayside inn, where
he stopped to drink, and found the landlord given that
way, and to be good company, he stayed for the day and
night, and even longer. And often he left the high-road,
and took those short~cuts across country which, like
“ raw haste,” are generally “ half-sisters to delay.” This
was especially the case when he began to draw near the
sea. Those who have passed much of their time upon
that element (voluntarily), the roar of ocean attracts as
the trumpet-blast the quondam charger, and mile after
mile did Derrick stride along the cliff-top whenever it
was practicable, and by the shore, notwithstanding that
his indulgence in that fancy doubled his journey. When
we are out of humour with our fellow-creatures, the ex-
ternal aspects of nature, even though we be no poets,
have often a special attraction for us 3 the winds of spring
-—since as much has been said of those of winter—are

certainly not so unkind as man’s ingratitude, and we bid
them blow with a sort of soothing scorn; nor does the
blue spring sky bite half so nigh as beneﬁts forgot. It
pleased Ralph Derrick to let it do its worst, and, rain or
shine, he never sought shelter save when he needed drink
or rest ; and during this last part of his travel, he obtained
them as often at some humble farmhouse as at an inn.
The simple folks, who stared at his great beard, and won-
dered why he did not show them what goods he had in
his knapsack, like any other pedlar, pleased him hugely;
and when some newly-soapetl and carefully-brushed
bashful child would steal into his humble dining-chamber
—which was the guidwife’s invariable plan of getting her
dues settled, since we cannot charge for things, you know
(and especially brandy), without a license—he would take
the little creature upon his knee, and give him or her
his newest shilling, in addition to what was always a
liberal settlement of the account. Perhaps he was
practising that mile of Patcrfamilias which he hoped to be
soon called upon to play. At all events, Ralph was by
this time in high spirits ; and when he was told that
Coveton lay not above a dozen miles ahead of him even
by the coast-line, he threw his cudgel into the air, and
shouted a wild fragment of a digger’s song, to the con-
sternation of his rustic informant.
His way lay now over a great waste of moorland, elastic
to the tread, and over which the wind sweptalmost as un-
resisted as on the ocean from whence it came. Here and
there, it whistled through a bare thorn, but what few trees
there were had hidden themselves in sunken hollows, and
stood therein, huddled together, with only their shivering
tops above the surface. Nothing was to be seen inland
save “a level waste of rounded gray,” broken now and
again by a church spire or a scattered hamlet; but the
seaward view was very ﬁne. From that m00rland height,
you looked upon two fair islands spread liked a raised
map, beneath, with every but and quarry distinctly plain,
and the small white light—house standing out on its little

hill like a child's toy upon its pedestal. How picturesque
and sequestered they looked : how like two miniature but
independent worlds, to either of which ‘a man who had
had enough and to spare of the turmoil of life might re-
tire with some ﬁtting mate, and peacefully end his days.
Surely, thought Ralph, he had somewhere seen those two
same islands before! As he stood at gaze, his thoughts
we'nt wandering over archipelagoes of garden-ground in
tropic seas ; over rocky islets sawn from iron-bound coasts
by the jagged waves; and over mounds of sand, which
the ocean had thrust back into the jaws of rivers, and
suffered man to call them land, and dwell there. But
these were none of those. As he went on more slowly,
searching through the long gallery of his mind for the
picture which he knew was there, and half bewildered by
the shifting scenes, he was startled by a noise like distant
thunder. The sky was almost without a cloud, and the
sea, although running high, and dashing with pettish
screech against the cliffs, was not so rough but that the
ﬁshing-smacks, of which there was quite a ﬂeet in motion,
carried all sail: moreover, the thunderous sound was not
upon the seaward side, but inland. A few score rapid
strides in that direction made its source apparent. An
enormous hole, like half-a-dozen gravel-pits in one, but
deep as a mine, was gaping there; and at the bottom,
whither it had tunnelled through years of patient unre-
mitting toil, lay the churning sea. It was a gruesome
sight to mark the solid earth~—-just where a peaceful corn-
ﬁeld met the moorland—thus invaded by its insidious
foe, whose horrid paean seemed to have something of
malicious greed as well as exultation in it, as though it
lusted to eat the heart of the round world itself away,
after the same manner. “The Devil’s Cauldron!" ex-
claimed Ralph excitedly, and then looked roundhim with
a. half-shudder, as though he had repeated the statement
out of deference to a great local authority, rather than
initiated it of his own free-will. Yes, such was the name
by which the place was known; he felt certain of that

fact; but unless in sober seriousness H. S. M. himself
had whispered the information, how did he ever come to
be aware of it P He had certainly never been there be-
fore, in all his life; it was impossible, having once seen it,
to have forgotten so abnormal as well as tremendous a
scene.
True, there are pits and holes in many cliffs a few
yards from their edge which reach like shafts in a
tunnel down to the sea; but the distance of this place
from the shore might be measured by furlongs, and the
pit was so large that it almost resembled a land-locked
bay. A cauldron it might well be called, where the black
waters were seething and boiling even now, while in
storm-time there would be such wild work as no mere
witches could raise, but only the ﬁend himself, their
master.
Did the mad waves, ﬁnding themselves thus im-
prisoned, ever leap up? Yes: now he remembered all.
Thirty years ago, last autumn, he had seen those islands
once before from shipboard, and had had them in view
for a whole day. The wind, which was dead against the
vessel, had kept her off and on that dangerous coasﬁ
and eventually risen to storm, and sunk her with all on
board save him alone. The last time he had seen
that little light-house, it had ﬂashed in vain its ﬁery wam-
ing through sheets of blinding foam. The captain had
told him, hours before, what sort of shore awaited them,
if ever the Mr”: Star should be driven upon those piti-
less cliffs, on which Derrick himself was now stand-
ing; and, in particular, he had mentioned the Devil’s
Cauldron, which was spouting foam yonder, he said, like
Leviathan, a quarter of a mile inland over the standing
corn.
Ralph lay down at full length upon the thymy moor, and
peered over the brink of the abyss with earnest gaze, as
though he could fathom its dark depths, and mark what lay
beneath them. Then rising, with asigh, he wandered on,
no longer with springy tread, until presently the dig-top

he knew that he had come to his journey’s end, and that

CHAPTER XXX.
COVETON.
OVETON—well known to ancient couples who
' took their ﬁrst honeymoons half a century ago
-—is one of those old fashioned sea-side places
that resolutely refuse to be “improved,” and
the denizens of which affect to speak of Brighton as
Brighthelmstone, and to treat it as a rival upon equal
temis. It has two very pretty inns, but there is so little
competition between them, that there is a shrewd sus-
picion that they are under the same management ; a few
more houses have been built, it is true, within the last
half century, but they are all constructed upon the same
principle of fancy architecture, adopted at Coveton from
the ﬁrst, and which perhaps I may term the Lowther
Arcadian. At least I am sure that the models of all
its dwelling-houses are to be found in that respectable
metropolitan emporium: weather indicators, built for the
accommodation of an unencumbered couple; churches
for the dressing-table, in the front elevation of which you
hang your watch before retiring to rest ; villa residences,
down whose chimneys you drop half-pence (or half-crowns,
if you are so minded), for'the encouragement of mis-
sionary enterprise ; and gritty erections for all sorts of in-
genious purposes, but which to the ﬁninstnicted suggest
only the means of lighting a cigar-match. You have no
idea, unless you have been to Coveton, how odd IS the

effect- of a real village to the construction of which these
Lowther Arcadian principles have been applied; where
the doctors, father and son, live in aweather indicator
(only, of course, about ﬁve hundred times as big), and the
former keeps indoors when it is wet, and the son goes out
in all weathers; where a genuine clergyman lives in a
magniﬁed money-box, and you look up involuntarily at
the upper windows, in the expectation of seeing H41) llze
Areal/zen running in a neat scroll beneath the ﬁrst and
second ﬂoors; and where the gritty church has a real
clock in the very place where the hole was left in the
model. The whole place looks, in short, as though some
clever child had built it out of a box of fancy bricks,
after the pattern of what he had seen on nursery mantel-
pieces, or suspended from Christmas-trees.
Not only is the place old-fashioned in itself, and reso-
lute to resist innovation, but the modern conveniences,
which some enthusiasts have endeavoured to import
thither, have suﬁ‘ered by the unnatural coalition. A
branch railway, for instance, has been attached to this
Sleepy Hollow from a great trunk-line ; but the only
result is that the railway has become demoralised, and
ceased to perform its functions. It goes no faster than
the four-horse coach, which still continues to run between
Coveton and the nearest provincial town; it is very un-
certain in its times of arrival and departure, and prone
to delay, for with old-fashioned gallantry, its trains never
fail to stop to pick up a lady, if she does but wave her
parasol, no matter whether there is a station on the spot
or not. As to the supply of luxuries, or even necessaries,
the railway has been a total failure, and there is just the
same difﬁculty in obtaining a suﬂiciency of food in
Coveton as in the good old times—immortalised in a.
wood-cut at the top of the hills of the Royal ﬁlarz'ne
Hard—when his Royal Highness the Duke of Kent
arrived there in a carriage-and-four with outriders, and
left a famine in the ﬂattered hamlet behind him, after a
residence of forty-eight hours. The most artful London

bargainer who should take lodgings in Coveton, and
attempt to do her own housekeeping, would infalliny
fail to procure sustenance for herself and family. Nobody
but a native can be certain, for instance, of securing a.
joint of meat. You have literally to “get up early," if
your ambition extends to anything of that kind. -By 9
o’clock A.M. the butcher's shop—the facsimile of those
which are sold in the Lowther Arcade for children to
play at “going to market” with—has disposed of its
single sheep, which lies dismembered and ticketed with
the names of 'its several purchasers, thus: Miss Robin-
son’s lqg; Mrs. Captain Caape/s shoulder; the Rev. fom's’
kidneys; and so on. No sheep will be killed again till
Saturday next. Beef is only to be looked for once a.
fortnight Veal is an accident not to be counted upon
at all. Game—you might just as well ask for Bird's-nest
soup; and all the ﬁsh that is ever caught at Coveton
goes as direct as the poor shambling dawdling railway
can take it to the great metropolis.
If you stay at either of the hotels, you will not indeed
be starved, because one half of the above-mentioned
sheep is always divided between those two establish-
ments; but you will not ﬁnd any more variety. They
are principally patronised by newly-married couples, who
are too intoxicated with happiness to be very particular
about their comfort. There are secluded arbours dotted
about the pretty gardens expressly for the accommoda-
tion of this class of the community; and when a new
arrival does not walk about the place with its arm round
its waist (I am speaking of course of that mysterious
duality which makes one out of two people), it walks
about, hand in hand, like grown-up children. Nobody
minds, in this little village, where honeymooning is the
normal state of visitors, and discreet behaviour the ex-
ception. Coveton itself, though on a. small scale, is
lovely, and naturally attracts these unsophisticated
couples as to another Eden 3 there area hundred winding
walks—with rather abrupt turnings, however, which I

have heard objected to as bringing folks face to face un-
expectedly upon other folks who are already in that posi-
tion—and seats provided at the local expense, command-
ing most exquisite views of the sea at all times, and of
the moon when there happens to be one ; and I do not
doubt that as pleasant hours have been spent at Coveton
as at any other place of its age and size within the four
seas. I do not, however, recommend any middle-aged
person, who has lost his taste for the mere vanities of
life, and is particular about having cucumber with his
salmon, to put up at either the Royal Marina 110ch at
Coveton, or the other. They are both perfectly clean,
it is true, but cleanliness is not everything, or else we
should all go to prison, or endeavour to obtain situations
from the Trinity House as supernumeraries in light-
houses. It is not pleasant to have one’s bed and board
in one (the mattresses of the R. H M indeed, I think,
are of cast iron) ; and when one does bring a bit of ﬁsh
with one from town, one does not like it to be boiled in
saltpetre, through a misunderstanding connected with
cooling one’s champagne with the best substitute for ice.
However, Mr. Ralph Derrick, who patronised this
particular establishment, found, for his part, nothing to
complain of, except that its half-pints of brandy were ex-
ceptionally small; he therefore ordered a second after
his dinner, and inquired of the waiter who brought it
where Jacob Forest lived, and which was the nearest way
of getting to his cottage.
“Jacob Forest, Sir ; yes, Sir. You don’t mean le'llz'am
Forest, perhaps, Sir?” answered the waiter, gently
whisking his napkin like a horse’s tail, and with an air of
patronage in his tone, as though he would say: “I am
very well aware you have made a mistake, so I do not
hesitate to own it.”
“N o, I don’t mean William Forest, nor yet Nebuchad-
nezzar Forest, nor Beelzebub Forest, if those names happen
to run in the family,” rejoined Derrick impatiently. “I
mean simply Jacob Forest."

“ Beg pardon, Sir, I’m sure, Sir. But such an exceed-
ingly old person, and so seldom inquired after ; whereas,
you see, William, he’s a boat or two to let; and if you
are anything in the shell or fossil line, he’s quite an
authority—Mr. Jacob’s cottage, Sir? Well, Sir, the fact
is, he has not lived in what you call a cottage for a long
time. He has had a snug little house of his own, ever
since my Lady Lisgard But you know all about
that story, I dare say, Sir?”
“ Yes, yes,” answered Derrick drin 3 for the very name
of Lisgard had grown distasteful to_ him, and particularly
in connection with his intended wife. “I_know that
Jacob’s daughter has a very kind mistress~very; in fact,
that she will never part with such a treasure of a waiting-
maid, if she can help it. But let us get on to the house,
if you please, for I want to call there tonight, and it is
even now growing rather dark."
“Yes, Sir; it is, Sir. I am sorry that the dinner was
so unavoidably delayed. The last train and the last
coach having come in, we did not expect any more
gentry this afternoon, or would have made preparation.
But the fact is, Sir, there is no hurry with respect to Mr.
Forest. . You will ﬁnd him abed now, and you will ﬁnd
him no more than that two hours hence, for poor old
Jacob is bed-ridden. Very cheerful though, I hear, and
would like a chat and a glass of grog with any gentleman
like yourself, no matter what time it was ; and if you will
permit me to advise, you will wait till the moon is up;
for the path across the Cove is not easy to ﬁnd after
dusk ; and then there’s the churchyard, which, somehow,
one always dislikes—at least I know I do— to pass
through latish, unless one can see one’s way pretty well ;
and after that, there’s a bit of a spinney before you get
to the old man’s house; so although you can see it at
top of the hill yonder from this window—there it is, the
white house with a thatched roof—you may judge that it
is a good long step."
“I see,” said Derrick, nodding. “Then I shall light

my pipe, and stroll down to the sea-shore until the moon
rises, if you’re sure that the old man will see me at so late
an hour.”
“I am quite sure, Sir ; it will please him above all
things, for he complains he gets no sleep of nights, to
speak of. You will go down to the Cove, of course ;
that’s what all our gentry does when there is a moon ; and
I shall sit up for you till you come back—although our
hour for closing is eleven, Sir, sharp.”
“Thank you, my man,” said Derrick, “do so ;" and
lighting his pipe, he strolled down thoughtfully towards
the shore.
It was dark enough in the wooded Cove, although the
trees were as yet but scantily clothed in their spring gar—
ments ,- but ever and anon, at a turn of the winding path,
he came to some open spot artistically left there, where
the darkling sea lay stretched before him, waiting for her
tiring-maid the moon to clasp her jewels on. Even thus
unadorned, she showed divinely fair as her bosom rose
and fell unstirred by passion, for the winds had lulled
since sundown, and her gentle breath came up to him in
even beats. How diﬁ‘erent must she have looked from
hence, thought he, upon that night of storm which he had
. expected to be his last. The gale was taking them in-
shore, when the vessel sprung her leak; and doubtless
many a fellow-passenger of his had reached this coast,
perchance this very Cove, although not with life. Oh,
treacherous sea ! you that can smile and smile, and break
into ten thousand smiles, and make such dainty music on
the pebbly shore, who can believe how cruel your wrath
can be, that has not seen you tear man’s ﬂoating home to
fragments, and whelm him with his dear ones in your
gaping depths ?
Ralph shuddered, and passed his hand across his
brow, as though to erase some terrible thought within it.
The silent sky, crossed by those swift and secret messen-
gers the clouds, has doubtless a lesson for man’s heart,
which it would be well if he would more often study 3 but

even Mr. Ruskin, the great self-elected authority upon the
subject, must acknowledge that there are physical difﬁ-
culties at the outset of this particular system of spiritual
education. Setting aside the fact, that it is only eagles
which can gaze upon the sun with undazzled eyes, the
human vertebra is not ﬁtted for any prolonged investiga-
tion of the ﬁrmament ; and if one lies on one’s back—I
don’t know whether I am singular in this apprehension,
but I am always afraid of some heavenly body slipping
out of space, and dropping upon one while in that exposed
position. But everybody can look upon the sea (from
the vantage-ground at least of the solid earth), and that is
the next best page of nature to the sky. There is some-
thing in its monotonous expanse which strikes most of
us, especially when we watch it alone and at night, with
mysterious, and perhaps religious awe. At all events, it
reminds us, if there be any materials for reﬂection within
us, of the brevity of our span of life, and of the littleness
of its aims; a visible etemity seeming to lie before us, in
the presence of which we are humbled. Under ordinary
circumstances, it was not likely that Derrick should ex-
perience these feelings, for sea-faring folks, in spite of
what has been written of those who do their business in
great waters, are least of all men subject to such inﬂuences :
but not only, as we have heard him tell Lady Lisgard,
did the sea at all times show to him like one great grave,
ever since it had engulphed his Lucy, but upon this oc-
casion he was regarding it at the very spot, or near it,
where the catastrophe had occurred. Thus, though the
moon had risen by this time, and bathed the deep, as all
things else on which it shone, in unutterable calm, Ralph’s
mental vision beheld waves mountains high, and one fair
fragile form, now lifted on their foaming tops, now buried
in their raging depths, but always dead and drowned.
“ Sorry to disturb you, Sir, but will you favour me with
half a pipeful of baccy? ” inquired a cheerful voice at his
elbow. “Seeing you was alone, and without your young
woman—which is rare in these parts,” continued the

stranger, evidently one of the ﬁshing community of the
place, for notwithstanding the ﬁneness of the night, he
was attired in waterproof overalls—“ I made bold, fellow-
smokers being always ready to help one another in that
way, if in no other.—Thank you, Sir. That will save me
going to the inn to-night, a visit my missis don’t approve
of."
“ Is Mat the inn P ” inquired Derrick, pointing to a
little low-roofed cottage just at the entrance to the Cove,
and only raised a few feet above high~water mark.
“ N 0, Sir; that's my own little place, William Forest,
at your service. If you happen to be in want of a boat,
or one as can show you where to ﬁnd the fossils and such
like, I can do that as well as any man in Coveton, let him
be who he will.”
“ Then you are old Jacob Forest’s nephew, I suppose,
for he had no son, and only one daughter, had he?"
“ Just so, Sir ; my Cousin Mary. A precious lucky
woman she is. It was through her I came to have the cot—
tage, for my uncle made it over to me when he moved to
the grand house on the hill yonder, as my Lady Lisgard
gave to him. God bless her ladyship, and good Sir
Robert too, though he’s gone to heaven by this time, and'
don’t want none of our wishes.”
“ Yes, yes," answered Derrick, with irritation ; “you
Coveton folks can talk of nothing but these Lisgards.
Now, just dismiss them from your mind while you
answer a question I am going to ask you. You are old
enough to remember that terrible storm which took place
here in the September of ’32, are you not? "
“Yes, Sir, yes. And none of us that saw it is ever
likely to forget it. That was the very time when old
Sir Robert ”
“Damn Sir Robert I” interrupted Ralph with energy.
“If you would only be so kind as to forget that respecta-
ble baronet, and all belonging to him, while you answer
me a simple question, I shall be greatly obliged to you.
Forgive me, mate—but my temper is not so good as my

tobacco. Pray, take another pipeful. Now, after that same
storm in which the Mr”: Star—that was the name of the
ship, was it not P—was lost yonder, were there many
bodies washed ashore about here ? "
“Dead uns, you mean, Sir, of course?” answered the
man, hesitatingly. “Well, yes, there was. I should
think, taking them altogether, for they came in, some of
them, weeks afterwards, I should think there was a dozen
or more ; many of them lashed to spars, poor things.
But it was no use."
“And where were these unfortunate creatures put to P "
inquired Derrick after a pause.
“They were all buried in the churchyard yonder, Sir.
Sir Robert Lisgard—but there, I forgot: you may read
some of their names—those at least as was identiﬁed—
upon the tombstones. It was a sad sight them burials.
Strangers, and very poor folks mostly, coming from miles
and miles away to see their dead, who had but left home
a few days before for a New World, indeed, as they call
it, but little thinking as it was for Mai. You should hear
Uncle Jacob talk of it."
“ Ah, sad, indeed,” echoed Derrick, rising from his
seat. “I am glad to have met you, mate; good-night,
and thank you.”
“Thank you, Sir; I never tasted better baccy.” '
Derrick waited until his companion had descended to
the very bottom of the Cove; waited until he saw the
cottage door open and shut—a mere streak of light and
shadow—and then followed on his steps; but having
reached the foot of the ravine, he took the winding path
that led up its opposite side towards the church and
Jacob Forest’s high-built dwelling.

CHAPTER XXXI.
THE MEMORIAL WINDOW.
' OTWITHSTANDING that Coveton Church is
“gritty,” like all the rest of the architectur'e in
that locality, and presents the appearance of an.
ecclesiastical ediﬁce swathed in sand-paper, it
is by no means unpicturesque ; while the spot on which
it stands can compare for beauty with any God'sacre in
England. It is more than a hundred feet above the level
of the village, and commands a glorious view, which
would be'a complete panorama, but for the steep wooded
hill, which protects it from the bitter north, and assists
the genial climate to make a ﬂower-garden of the church-
yard three parts of the year round. Even thus early in
the summer, had Ralph’s visit been paid in the daytime
instead of the night, he would have seen it bright with
bud and blossom, for almost every grave was itself a little
parterre, tended by pious hands. Poor wasted human
forms, but not seldom dearer to others than the hand-
somest and healthiest, often come to Coveton to prolong
for a little their painful lives, until they ﬂit away like
shadows; indeed, if you read the grave-stones, you will
ﬁnd three out of four are records of departed youth.
The newly married pass their honeymoons at the pleasant
little village, and those who have been sentenced to death
by the doctors come also thither, and a strange and
touching contrast they afford.

The low large moon was ﬂooding the sacred place with
its soft radiance, so that the inscriptions were as plain to
be seen as in broad noonday. From knoll to knoll, each
rooﬁng sacred dust, Ralph wandered, not unmoved; for
he too had lost a dear one by untimely death, and even
now was looking for the place where haply she might lie.
He would have felt it in some sort a comfort to know that
her bones rested beneath the rounded turf, rather than in
yonder shifting deep, although, beyond _the wooded
village with its scattered lights, it lay as motionless at
present as a silver pall. No less than thrice, he came
upon the tombs of those with whom he had been a
fellow-passenger on board that doomed ship so many
years ago. Time had done its work with these, _and they

Ralph remembered 'him very well. They had been fellow-

had troubled him at ﬁrst, sailing as he did undera feigned
name ; but they had met but once before, and the mate
' had, as it turned out, no remembrance of him. But
Ralph well remembered what uneasiness the possibility of
recognition had given him at the time, for it might have
been supposed that he had committed some disgraceful
crime, which would cause him, and what was worse, his
wife and the Meades, to be looked upon askance through-
out the voyage. But what did it matter now? What
had anything mattered to that great ship’s company, so

the wife, were delicate and sickly. It seemed somehow
ﬁtting enough that these two, though dead, should have
come to land ,' while the others, poor things, should have
succumbed to the stormy deep. The third inscription
was even a more remarkable one. Upon a huge re-
cumbent slab, which evidently roofed the remains of
more than one person, were engraved these words :

A nameless grave, indeed, with not even the number
or the sex of its unfortunate inmates speciﬁed ! The slab
bore the date of but a week or two subsequent to the
catastrophe, yet spoke “of lapse of time.” How im-
possible, therefore, to discover new whose bones had
mouldered beneath it into dust. His Lucy might be
there, or she might not. It was one of the few tombs
that exhibited no trace of care ; but a tuft of violets, the
sweet breath of which betrayed them, chanced to be
growing at the edge of it, and Derrick plucked them and
placed them in his bosom. He seemed to feel certain
now that she had come ashore sawmills/'2; and why not
here? How solemn and still it was! The very air,
though odorous and fresh, seemed full of the presence of
the dead ; and Ralph's thoughts were with them, so that
he quite forgot the purpose with which he had visited the
little village, light after light in which was being quenched
beneath him, for it was growing late.
Was it likely that there would be any record of the
perished crew in the church itself? They had almost all
been in humble circumstances, being emigrants, and there-
fore it was not probable that any such costly memorial
should have been erected; but still it was just possible.
The oaken door, studded with iron nails, was locked, and
also a small postern that led into a diminutive vestry, an
offshoot of the main building. The windows, too, were
fastened on the inside, or gave. no promise of opening,

either in hinge or handle; but he climbed up to the sill
of one of them, for they were of no great height, and
looked in. The church was small, but very neat and
pretty, with carved oaken sittings, a handsome double
pulpit, and a huge brass lectern, of the use of which the
present spec‘tator knew nothing. Ralph had not seen so
much of the inside of a church for many a year, and he
was fortunate in the specimen thus accidentally submitted
to his notice. The wealthy visitors of the place had done
their duty, and gratiﬁed their taste at the same time, by
many a pious offering. A small but splendid organ, with
gilded and star-bespangled pipes, adorned the gallery on
his left : and immediately in front of him glowed a
memorial window. There were other smaller ones,
erected, doubtless, in tribute to some of those dear ones
who had been laid so prematurely in the graveyard with-
out ; but this was a very large and elaborate specimen of
modern art. The designer, in his admiration of the “
antique, had carefully reproduced every blemish peculiar
to an age wherein anatomy was never studied save by
doctors, and perspective was utterly unknown. The per-
sons represented were the four evangelists, all in the most
gorgeous dyes, and as large as life; but with their magni-
tude ceased almost all similarity to the human form
divine. Their spines were dislocated, their bones were
distorted ; and where a limb was bent, it exhibited a sharp
angle, like a broken branch. In the background rose the
mountains of Judaaa, of the same size and shape as
Christmas plum-puddings, with the sun setting luridly in
'the midst of them, like snapdragon. Ralph, however,
was quite of the opinion of the great authorities upon
church decoration, and thought this very ﬁne; he was
also perfectly right in coming to the conclusion that such
a work of art must have cost somebody a good bit of
money. The moonlight streamed in behind him full upon
it, and lit up all its splendid hues. Besides the scrolls,
with texts upon them, proceeding out of the months of
these individuals like ribbons from between the lips of a

conjuror at a fair, there was a gilded inscription under-
neath the whole, in highly ﬂorid and decorated print. In
the case of the texts, when you had managed to master
the ﬁrst letter, the deciphering of the rest was, to a per-
son acquainted with the Scriptures, tolerably easy ; though
poor Ralph was by no means “ ediﬁed,” and could make
nothing of them at all ; but as for the inscription at the
base, it looked to him at the ﬁrst glance as meaningless
as the hieroglyphics on a tea-chest.
“ Why cannot these good people write what they have
to say in plain English?” thought Derrick irreverently;

This last ejaculation was uttered with excessive ve-
hemence, and the excitement of the speaker was such
that he could scarce keep his balance on the narrow sill
upon which he half knelt, half clung. His hot breath
had dimmed the glass, and as he wiped the moisture from
it with his handkerchief, his ﬁngers trembled so with
agitation that they tapped audibly upon the pane. He
glued his face to the window for upwards of a minute, and
when he took it away again, it was white as the marble
font that gleamed within. Had Ralph Derrick seen a
ghost, that he slipped down from that window-sill with
such excessive precipitation, and stood beneath it with his
hat oﬂ‘, wiping his cold brow? “Am I awake or dream-
ing?" murmured he, striking himself a sounding blow
upon the chest. “Was the brandy at yonder inn so
strong that it has drugged me? or has this moonlight, as
some hold it does, been stealing away my wits? or has
the subject of my thoughts suggested names of which I
had believed no record survived?” Once more Ralph
took his station at the window, and this time did not leave

wandering mind there came some half-forgotten tale, heard
from he knew not whom, of some Scotch laird who, gifted
with the second sight, perceives a funeral pass by—the
coﬁin borne by relatives of his, and followed by troops of
mourning friends—and marvels that among the woeful
crowd he does not recognise himself. Surely, thinks he,
he should be there, to show respect to the common friend
departed, whom he must have known so well, although he
misses no remembered face. Then on a sudden it strikes
him that he must himself be in the cofﬁn—that it is his
own interment of which he is the witness—and his heart
fails within him because he feels that he has had his
warning, and stands indeed within‘ the shadow of black
death. Why Ralph should think of such a tale in such a
place may perhaps have been easily accounted for, but
once remembered, he applied it with lightning speed to
the subject in his mind, only in an inverse sense. The
reason why his Lucy’s name was not upon that mystic
monument, where those of her parents and her husband
were glowing in purple and gold, must be that she herself
was alive. Nay, who upon earth could have wished thus
piously to perpetuate their memory except Lucy herself?
How she could have had the power to do so, in so splen-
did and enduring a manner, would have been of itself
sufﬁciently miraculous, but that that circumstance was
swallowed up, like Pharaoh’s serpents, by the still greater
miracle—the fact that she was among the living l

might have been alive when she caused that window to
be set up, and yet not now. He knew that those gor-

dimmed : supposing that he allowed ﬁve years (in which,
by-the-bye, Ralph was very near the truth) as a reasonable
time to have elapsed between the shipwreck and the time

that this memorial was erected—and in less time, how
was it possible she could have saved the money for such
a purpose—that would still leave more than a quarter of a.
century between its erection and the present time. A
quarter of a century ! a generation of human life ! Time
enough to die, to marry—but no, his Lucy would never
have done that. This window, showing so tender a re-
gard after such a lapse of years, was evidence in some sort
to the contrary ; and since he himself had never forgotten
fur, and only now, after a lonely lifetime, was meditating
another marriage, he felt no apprehension upon that score.
No ; if his Lucy was alive, she was still his, and free to
welcome him as of old to her loving arms. The only
question with which he had now any real concern was,
whether she still lived? Henceforward, it would be his
sole business in the world to ﬁnd this matter out. And
ﬁrst, she must certainly have been washed ashore alive;
and somewhere in these parts. Who, then, so ﬁt to give
him information upon that point as old Jacob Forest, who
had lived at Coveton all his life, and at that time, in the

So Ralph Derrick (for, like everybody else, we may still
continue to call him so) took the path that he had
originally intended to take after all, notwithstanding his
marvellous discovery, and made straight for J-acob’s
dwelling on the hill; no longer with the intention of
winning a bride, but of- recovering a long-lost wife.

CHAPTER XXXII.
JAcon’s GUARD-SHIP.
HATEVER evils may happen unto me, may
Heaven spare my reason,” was the heart_
felt prayer of a wise and reverent man. He
might have added -—for he was one of
those who thought it no harm to ask of Him who watches
the sparrow’s fall, for particular blessings—“ And however
I be racked with pain by day, by night may I still enjoy
my sleep." Next to madness, and like enough with some
folks to end in that, is the want of rest during that period
which should be the season of slumber, and which, if it
be not so, is a dread and dreary time indeed. There is
many an honest soul in the autumn of life who will pro-i
test in the morning, in the course of a very tolerable
breakfast, that she has not had a wink of sleep all night,
because she has heard a few consecutive hours recorded
by the church clock ; but to lie awake indeed from eve
to mom is not, thank God, a. very common experience,
and still less often are any of us compelled to endure it
night after night for years. To live an existence the con-
verse of the rest of their fellow-creatures is the lot of more
than one trade—editors of daily newspapers, for instance,
and burglars; but to more by night is a very different
affair from the lying awake unemployed, but thinking,
thinking, while nothing breaks the silence of the muﬁled

world save the howl of the watch-dog and the weird
monotony of the wind. Yet there are some of us doomed
to this sad fate, who scarcely know what it is to spend an
easeful night, and who snatch their scanty dole of sleep
by day.
Poor Jacob Forest was one of these. A long life of
reckless exposure to the elements, not, perhaps, unassisted
by hard drinking, had brought him to this sad pass.
Thanks to his daughter, he wanted for nothing that
money could give him ; but the once hale and venturous
mariner was now bedridden and racked at most times,
but especially by night, with rheumatic twinges. Mary
herself never failed to visit him every summer: and three
days out of four some ancient comrade would painfully
climb the hill that led to his cosy little house, and hob
and nob with him by his bedside. But he was still sadly
in want of company during the night-watches ; true, a
nurse was paid to minister to his comforts during that
season, but she generally “ dropped otf" into a. doze,
sooner or later; and even if .she was awake, hcr gossip
was of the tea-and-mufﬁn sort, rather than that descrip-
tion of talk which goes best with hot grog, and was more
suitable to a seasoned vessel, though laid up in extra-
ordinary, like old Jacob. Therefore it was, as the waiter
at the Royal Marine had observed, that visitors calling at
ultra-fashionably late hours at the Guard-ship, as it was
the proprietor’s fancy to term his place of residence, were
especially welcome.
The home of this old veteran had been built, at his
own request, of wood, notwithstanding the remonstrances
of his medical attendant, who ascribed part of his patient's
ailments to the fact, that his cottage on the shore had
been constructed of that material. But Mr. Forest had
insisted upon having his way: next to one’s own boat,
he had argued, there was nothing like a wooden house to
make one feel at home in ; nor could he be moved from
that position by the caustic rejoinder, that in that case
he might just as well get into his cofﬁn at once. Nay,

the Guard-ship had been made still less air-tight than it
otherwise would have been by the ingenious introduction
of a hinge running along one side of the old man’s bed-
room on the ground-ﬂoor, the very wall of which, in
summer-time, could thereby be lowered ﬁapwise, expos-
ing the whole arrangement of his bower after the manner
of the better class of doll’s houses. With the eccentricity
of taste so often exhibited in the possessors of unex-
pected wealth, Mr. Forest had “gone in,” as the phrase
runs, in his prosperous old age, for curious poultry ; and
up his slanting shutter (exactly as horses are introduced
into a railway train) used to be driven from the yard for
his immediate inspection, as he lay in bed, every sort of
feathered fowl after their kind, as into a poultry ark. The
earliness of the season, combined with the lateness of the
hour, denied this exhibition (afforded to all visitors when-
ever practicable) to Ralph Derrick, but the ancient
mariner gave him the heartiest of welcomes, as had been
predicted. He had heard of Mr. Derrick more than once
from Mary, and was exceedingly pleased to do him
honour; at which hint the nurse at once set forth the
“materials” for a drinking-bout on a little table which
stood at the invalid’s elbow, and betook herself to an
adjoining cabin, where _she instantly went to bed with
her clothes on. Next to the danger from draughts,
to which the captain of the Guard-ship had already
succumbed, he lay in nightly peril of perishing by ﬁre,
since he smoked in bed almost unceasingly ; and in case
of a spark igniting where it should not, the whole two-
decker would not have taken a quarter of an hour to
become a heap of ashes; but this apprehension, as the
old woman was glad to think, was groundless upon this
occasion, when her master had a gentleman to keep him
company, and she left them with an easy conscience to
their pipes and grog.
“So I hear you are rather sweet upon my good Mary,"
observed the old sailor slyly, as soon as they were left
alone. “She writes to me more than most girls do to

their fathers, you see, Mr. Derrick, knowing I’m all alone
here, and so pleased to hear any news.”
“ Very right and very proper," returned Ralph quietly,
“and a very good girl, as you say, she is, although she is
not a very young one.”
“ Young enough for some folks, at all events—eh; eh,
Sir?" chuckled the old man. “Come, come—I know
all about you, and what you’re come here about; I’m
wide awake enough, I can tell you, although I’m abed.
You’ve run down to Coveton, Sir, to ‘ask papa.’ There,
haven’t I hit it?” ,
“Well, the fact is, Mr. Forest, the love seems rather
more on my side than hers. I don’t deny that I had a
great liking for your daughter, but when a man knows
that his love is not returned ”
“Eh, eh,” interrupted the old salt, pursing his lips
and giving his tasselled night-cap a pull upon one side,
which gave him an expression of much aimless intelli-
gence; “butl don’t understand this. You must have
done something, Sir, to forfeit the good opinion of my
Mary; for certainly, at one time But there, perhaps
I’m saying too much. If it aint agreed between you and
my Mary, then, may I ask, Sir—not but that I’m un-
common glad to see you, or any other gentleman, from
nightfall to anyone of the small-hours; I’m sure—but may
I ask what the dickens brings you here?”
“Well, Sir,” replied Ralph, forcing a smile, “I hap-
pened to ﬁnd myself in these parts, and did not like to
pass by without looking in upon the father of Mary
Forest, even though all should be off between us ; and,
besides, I was told you are the likeliest man to be able
to give me some information about the wreck of the
M111: Star, which happened about thirty years ago, and
the particulars of which, for a reason, I want to know.”
“ Fill your pipe, then, and mix yourself another glass,”
cried the old man, delighted to be called upon for his
favourite yarn, “ for it’s a story as you can’t tell in a ﬁve
minutes, nor in ten neither. The ship you speak of, Sir,

was an emigrant vessel of more than a thousand tons, as
sailed on September 10, I832 "
“I know all about the ship,” interrupted Derrick im-
patiently, “ for I had a passage in her myself. I want to
hear about the bodies that came on shore."
“ You were a passenger by the .Nurf/z Star?” ejaculated
the old man with amazement. “Why, it was said that
every soul on board her perished in the storm in which
she went to pieces. Derrick, Derrz'rk / Well, now you
mention it, I do remember the name, for I used to have
that passenger-list by heart. I cut it out of one of the
papers at the time, and having been so much concerned
in the matter myself, though little knowing that I should
owe this house to that same wreck—built out of its very
timbers, as I might say—~and almost all I have in this
world. But you know how all that came about, and
what Sir Robert did for me and mine, I dare say,

“Yes, yes—I have heard something of that. But can
you tell me nothing of what came ashore? You have
said nota soul was saved; I suppose, then, it was the
surviving relatives who put up the gravestones to the
memory of the drowned, which I saw as I came through
the churchyard P” i
“That was just it. There were ﬁve men and three
women—poor souls—laid under the big stone next the
yew-tree; nobody knew who they were. Sir Robert paid
for that too, if I remember right—let's see—" '
“ I hear of nothing but ‘ Sir Robert’ and ‘Sir Robert'
in this village of yours," interrupted Ralph impatiently.
“ Nobody has a story to tell in Coveton but manages to
bring that man's name in by head and shoulders. Why
the deuce do they do it P ”
“Because he’s been the making of the place—that‘s
why, and because there’s a little gratitude left in our
village still, I am glad to say, Sir, although it may have
died out in the world," replied the old sailor ﬁrmly.
“Why, he not only built the roof that is now sheltering

time when my lady ”
“Well, he didn’t put up that great bit of painted glass
in the church, I suppose,” broke in Derrick testily, “to
the memory of Frank Meade and others, did he? for
t/zat’: what I want to get at, and nothing else.”
“ Did he not P Then who did it, I should like to
know?" answered Mr. Forest sarcastically. “Who but
himself and my lady 3 and if it had been the old times as
I’ve heard tell of instead of now, there would have been
priests paid to pray for their poor souls until this day;
ay, that there would. ' He was never tired of showing his
thankfulness for the joy that came to- himself, and his
pity for the woe that befell others upon that awful night.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good, they say, and
the storm that carried the [thrill Star to the bottom with
all on board save one—or two, I should now say, since
I have no reason to doubt your word, Mr. Derrick "
“ Ay, tell me about the storm,” said Ralph in an
altered voice, and with a face grown very white and still.
“ I will not interrupt you again, I will not' indeed. One
poor creature came ashore alive, you said P ”
“ What! do you mean to say my Mary never told you P

would hear it from the first man you met in Coveton, and
asked how Sir Robert Lisgard got his bride.”
“Just so," said Derrick in a hoarse whisper; “ there-
fore please to tell me."

feet ; “ do you wish to drive me mad? I tell you I was
on board of her myself. Tell me about the woman that
came ashore lashed to the spar."
“What ! then, you do kn0w about it after all?"
grumbled the old man, removing his pipe from the
corner of his mouth, an action which represented the
greatest amount of astonishment of which he was capa-
ble. “ Why the deuce did you bother me to spin you
the yarn, then P A man at my time of life aint got much
breath to throw away, I can tell you."
“ How was she dressed? What had she on?” in-
quired Derrick, upon whose ears his short-winded host’s
remonstrance had fallen unheeded. '
“ Devilish little," returned the old fellow gruﬁly :
“nothing but a petticoat, and what my Mary calls a
' body—but which I should call a bust—and a sailor’s
pea-jacket, and that was not rightly upon vher, but tied
between her and the spar, to save her dainty limbs, poor
girl; and it is my opinion that he was an honest-hearted
chap as put it there, and almost deserved to have her for
himself. But there, they were brother and sister, so i/mt
couldn’t be. Moreover, she couldn’t have got better off
than she did, that’s certain. Lord, to think that there
poor, friendless, penniless, clotheless creature—as I had
thought to be almost lifeless too, when me and Sir Robert
dragged her in from the hungry waves—should come to
be Lady Lisgard of Mirk Abbey—— What's the matter
with the man? Hi, nurse, hi! Confound the woman,
how she sleeps! Where the devil's my stick?”
Mr. _lacob Forest’s temper was hasty, but he had no
intention of inﬂicting corporal punishment on the re-
spectable female who was too deeply plunged in slumber
to attend to his cries. He desired his stick in order that
he might smite the battered gong that hung at his bedside,
and upon which (besides using it as a gentle indication
of her presence being required) he was accustomed to
execute an imitation of ship's “bells” throughout the
watchful night. Before, however, he could lay his

crippled ﬁngers upon the instrument required, Ralph
Derrick, who had fallen from his chair upon the carpet-
less ﬂoor, began to recover his senses, and with them his
speech.
“Don’t be alarmed, Sir—don’t call your nurse,” said
he, gathering himself up ; “it is only a sort of fainting-ﬁt
to which I am subject—indeed I was born with them.”
“And you’ll die with them too, some day," thought
old Jacob to himself, as he stared with undisguised ap-
prehension at his visitor’s white face and shaking limbs.
“ Don’t you think you had better take a little more rum
—or stay, perhaps it’s that that’s done the mischief P"
“No, it's not that,” answered Derrick bitterly, as he
ﬁlled himself a wine-glass of the liquor neat. “ I’m
better now, and I shan’t give way again. But I remem-
ber the man that took such care of the woman you speak
of, just before the vessel parted; and your mention of it
gave me quite a turn. I didn’t know he was her brother;
but he was much more careful about her safety than his
own—God knows.”
“Very like," rejoined the old fellow, “and what I
should have expected, even if they had not been so near
related. She was just the sort of woman that any man
worth his salt would be willing to lay down his life for.
His Christian name was Ralph, was it not, the same as
yours 1’ "
“ Yes, it was,” answered the other, gravely. “Who
was it that told you that? I forgot, though ; it is painted
in the church-window."
“ I found it out myself,” continued the old fellow,
cunningly, “long before that there memorial window was
up ; for my lady never talked about it even to Mary. But
there was Ralf/z Galleria”: written inside the collar of
the pea-coat, and I kept it for many a year myself until the
moth got in it, because I thought the sight of it might
distress the poor lady.”
_ “Women soon get over that sort of thing," said Ralph
in a grating vorce.

“Well, yes; sooner or later, I dare say they do. And
a very fortunate thing it is, in my opinion, that such is the
case. It would be very bad for us all, and particularly
for seafaring folk, if we never smiled again because a
party as we liked happened to be drowned, like some
king of England as my Mary once read about to me when
I was down with my ﬁrst ﬁt of the rheumatiz. Why, I’ve
lost acouple of brothers myself in that same way, and very
good chaps they were: but why should I make myself
wretched because they’re gone to heaven? Take another
pipe, man ! Why, you’re not going to leave me,
surely? "'
“Yes, I am, Jacob Forest,” answered Derrick, gloomily.
“I have heard all that I want to know, and more—much
more ! If you have any message for your daughter,
I’ll take it to her. I am going off to Mirk at
once.”
“You may tell her—but no; I’ll tell her myself, and
not trouble you,” answered the old fellow hastily, purple
at least as much with rage as rum. “I don’t wish to
be under the slightest obligation to a fellow as looks in
upon a poor cripple under pretence of friendship, and
then directly he’s heard all he wants, and drank all he can,
and had one of his ﬁts as he was born with, all as snug
as can be—Hi, nurse, hi ! Damme, if the fellow hasn’t
actually left the front-door open ! " And the invalid
applied himself to his gong with a fury that would have
roused the Seven Sleepers, had they chanced to have
been slumbering (let alone taking a nap with their
clothes on) in the adjacent room. “Push my table
nearer," cried he to his terriﬁed attendant, “and give me
paper and pens. Yes, my Mary particularly begged of
me to let her know at once in case he called, and I will
do so; but I will also take leave to tell her what a selﬁsh
scoundrel, in my opinion, he is; and I’ll mention his
alarming ﬁts. If she has found any reason to be dissatis-
ﬁed with the beggar, I’ll give her some more ; and mind,

Epistolary composition was not an accomplishment in
which the old sailor was an adept, and the mechanical
part of the operation was a very slow one with him, by
reason of his inﬁrmities ; but nevertheless he managed to
indite a missive more or less to his mind, long before the
early mail went out from Coveton, and his faithful attend-
ant did his bidding by posting the same.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH.
~' T is the morning that immediately precedes Sir
Richard's fete-day, and all at the Abbey are
as busy as a hive of bees. Mrs. Welsh is
engaged in incessant warfare with a “ professed
cook " of the male sex, who has been imported from town
with an army of myrmidons clad in white aprons and
head-pieces ; and Mr. Roberts carries the key of the
cellar about his person as religiously as though it were an
amulet, exceedingly regretting that the person who has
undertaken to purvey the cold collationv to the tenantry
does not also furnish the wine. For three shillings or
three shillings and sixpence the bottle, he argues, as
good a sherry as they have any right to taste might be
set before Farmer Beeves and “that sort," and yet we
are about to give them the old “West India,” as stood
old Sir Robert in sixty shillings a dozen a quarter of a.
century ago ; nay, even four dozen of cob-web port, the
age of which is absolutely unknown, have been set aside
for the after-dinner tickling of those rough palates, which
would as lief or liever (thinks Mr. Roberts) have gin and
whisky-punch. The gentlefolks, to be sure, dine with
them, but you never catch Me”: (Mr. R. has observed)
doing much in the way of drink at a three-o'clock dinner
in a marquee.
There is to be dancing in the said tent, which has been

boarded for that purpose, later in the evening; and a
ball will take place at the Abbey likewise, to which all
the “county” has been invited, and perhaps a little
more.
It was a difﬁcult matter even for Sir Richard, who had
a speciality for such solemn follies, to decide exactly what
were “county families ” and what were not, and where the
imaginary line that divided the ball-room from the
marquée was to be laid down. The social diﬁ'erence
between the person of the least importance that had the
.mtrée of the former, and the person of the greatest im-
portance who was consigned to the latter was, of course,
inﬁnitesimally small, and the decision involved all the
difficulties with which the theologians aﬂiict themselves
concerning the future position of the indifferently Good
and the tolerably Bad. What had Mr. Jones, M.R.C.S.
of Dalwynch, done that he should be admitted into
Paradise, while the crystal bar was obstinately interposed
against the entrance of Mr. Jones, M.R.C.S., from the
capital of Wheatshire? Nothing of himself, was the
baronet's stern decree; but it could be proved beyond
cavil that the former was remotely related to the Davey
Joneses of Locker Hall, a family of immense antiquity,
and distinguished in our naval annals ; whereas the latter
had no higher connection to boast of than Thomas Jones,
J.P. of Allworthy Court (himself only admitted to the
higher sphere by reason of a fortunate marriage), and
was therefore, as it were, predestined to sit below the
salt.
There were, however, some exceptions even to this
Draconian system. Dr. Haldane, for instance, was im-
portuned with an earnestness that Sir Richard would never
have used to any peer of the realm, to. honour this ocea-
sion with his presence, and break through his stubborn
resolve not to set foot within Mirk Abbey; but the old
man, although greatly moved, declined the invitation.
Madame de Castellan, too, notwithstanding she was such
a new-comer to the county, was called upon at Belcomb

by Sir Richard in person, and though she was not well
enough to see him, expressed herself by letter as hugely
gratiﬁed by the object of his visit ; albeit at the same time
she gave him to understand that all festivities were just
now distasteful to her, and indeed that she had not the
strength for them. “As for his coming of age,” added
the old Frenclnvoman, “she was not at all sure that such
an event was a subject of congratulation, though, if it
had been his marriage-day, then indeed she might have
come, if it were only to make his young bride jealous.”
Besides these two refusals, there was scarcely any. The
popularity of the Lisgard family, and the gorgeous scale of
the promised entertainment—the engagement of the
Coldstream band was ascertained beyond a doubt, and
there was a whisper aﬂoat concerning ﬁreworks, and even
that the ornamental water was to be illuminated—com-
bined to attract not only everybody who was anybody,
but a still vaster throng of nobodies at all. Every inhabi-
tant 0f Mirk, from the grandparents to the babes in arms,
for instance, were invited to take their ﬁll of beef and
beer, if their digestion permitted of it, and if not, there
was plenty of rich plum-pudding ; for besides the marquee
half the park had been put under canvas, in order to
make the festivities as much as possible independent of
the weather, and presented the appearance of a miniature
camp, which would be still more the case 'upon the
morrow, when the scene was enlivened by the uniforms
of the “ Lisgard’s Own," as some of the “yellows” had
wickedly christened the Mirk Volunteer Corps.
Altogether, there was every reason for Sir Richard’s
. being in the best of spirits. Master Walter, too, secretly
conscious of having been a much worse boy than he was
known to be, and-feeling that he had met better luck,
if not than he deserved, certainly than he could reasonably
have expected, was in high feather; he was deeply grate-
ful to his mother that she had abstained from reproaehing
him with the contents of the letter written by- Mr.
Abrahams, the settlement of whose claim she had taken

upon herself ,- and he well knew that the most welcome
way in which he could show his gratitude would be taking
part with a good grace in his brother’s triumphal entrance
upon his twenty-ﬁrst birthday.
Rose, who had obtained her ends, as well as full sub-
stantial forgiveness (which was all she cared for), for the
means employed, and foresaw the prostration of half the
young men of the county at her pretty feet upon the
morrow, was in excellent humour with herself, and there-
fore with the world. As for Letty, it is unnecessary to say
more than that she felt a measureless content in the
society of Mr. Arthur Haldane, who passed all his days
just now up at the Abbey, having placed his valuable
services entirely at the disposal of Lady Lisgard, and
generally found his duties led him into the vicinity of her
ladyship’s daughter. ' -‘
His taste for table decoration and ﬂoral devices, though
newly developed, was really, Letty afﬁrmed, of a very
high order, and as she was perpetually appealing to it,
there can be no doubt that she believed what she said.
All at Mirk Abbey, in short, were, or seemed to be, in
a state of pleasurable excitement and joyous expectation,
save its unhappy mistress. In vain, Sir Richard tried to
persuade himself that she was only suffering from a
feeling of responsibility—apprehensive lest anything
should go wrong in the arrangements of the all-important
morr0w; in vain, Master Walter endeavoured to pacify
his own mind with the thought, that although a part of his
mother’s anxieties might have been caused by his own
misdoings, all trace of "them would disappear so soon as
she should discover that his intention of divorcing him-
self from the turf, as well as all other kinds of gambling,
was as sincere as it really was.
Letty did not attempt to gloss over the fact, that her
mother looked both ill and wretched, but rather reproached
herself that though this was the case she could not help
feeling happy in the company of her lover. Perhaps it
was the contrast to the festive air worn by all around her

that made my lady’s face look so pinched and woeful;
but certainly, as the fete-day approached, her cheeks
grew more and more pallid, and her eyes sank in deepen-
ing hollows.
On the morning in question, the post-bag, through some
delay on the railway, did not arrive until the family were
at breakfast ; my lady, with her scarcely touched dry-
toast before her, watched Sir Richard open it, and dis-
tribute the contents with an anxiety she could not
conceal. '
“There is nothing for you, dearest mother," said he,
in answer to her inquiring looks.
“Who, then, is that for?" returned she, pointing to
an unappropriated letter he had placed at his left hand.
“ Only a note for Forest, which I dare say will keep till
we have left the table," said he, smiling; “although, if
you had your way, I know she would be attended to
before everybody. It has the Coveton post-mark, and
doubtless comes from old Jacob.”
“ Who is ill," said my lady, rising. “I do not see why
Mary’s correspondence should be delayed more than that
of anyone else. I have ﬁnished my breakfast, and will
take it to her at once."
When she had left the room, Sir Richard remarked
with asperity, that his mother’s kindness really rendered
her a slave to “that woman Forest.”
“That is so,” assented Master Walter ; “and I have
of late observed that her spirits are always at the lowest
when she has been having a confab with Mary. Is it
possible, I wonder, that being balked of that fellow,
Derrick, Mistress Forest can have taken up with any
new-fanglcd religious notions—I have heard of old maids
doing such things—which are making her miserable and
my mother too P ”
“For shame, Walter !” cried Letty. “ Do you suppose
mamma is capable of any such folly P ”
“ I don’t believe for a moment that she is a victim to
any delusion herself," explained Walter; “but she sym-

pathises with everybody she has a liking for, and the
society of any such morbid person would be very bad
for her. Between ourselves, I don’t think that Madame de
Castellan coming here has done her any good. That’s a
precious queer old woman, you may depend upon it.
Not only did she decline to permit old Rachel and her
husband to continue to sleep at Belcomb, which, con—
sidering its loneliness, one would have thought she
would have been glad to do, instead of their occupying
the lodge a quarter of a mile away ; but it is said that
she absolutely dismissed her French maid the day after
her arrival, and therefore lives entirely alone l"
“No wonder, then, she was so uncommonly anxious
to get Mary," observed the baronet; “and I am sure I
wish she may, for my mother’s sake. I have no doubt
they are now both closeted together over that old
dotard’s letter from Coveton. As if there was not
enough for my poor dear mother to do and think of just
now without bothering herself with her waiting-maid’s
father’s rheumatism."
Sir Richard was right: my lady and her conﬁdential
servant were at that very moment in the boudoir per-
using with locked doors old Jacob's letter. From it Lady
Lisgard gathered what had happened at Coveton as cer-
tainly as though the writer had been aware of it all, and
written expressly to inform his daughter.
“ He has found it out,” said she with a ghastly look.
“He had that ﬁt, as your father calls it, at the moment
when he learned for the ﬁrst time that the girl who came
ashore alive and myself are one and the same. Poor
Ralph, poor Ralph! "
“ Dearest mistress, I think it is poor you who are
most to be pitied. Great Heaven, he will be here to-
night, or tomorrow at latest ! To-morrow—in the midst
of all the merry-making about Sir Richard.”
“Yes, Sir Richard!" exclaimed my lady bitterly.
“The poor bastard that thinks he is a baronet! But
let him come, let him come, I say.” My lady rose

from her seat with clenched ﬁngers and ﬂashing eyes.
“I will defend my children with my life—nay, more,
with my honour. If I perjure myself to save them
from shame and ruin, will not God pardon me? Who
is there to witness against them save this man alone?
And is not my word — my oath — as good as his?”
She stepped to the little bookcase that ran round the
room; and from the corner of it, half-hidden by the
framework, took down a dusty volume—one of a long
series, but the remainder of which were in the library.
It was the Annual Rzgz'sler for the year 1832. Under
the head of “Shipping Intelligence," where the tersest
but most pregnant of all summaries is 'always to be
found—the deaths of hundreds of poor souls, the misery
of thousands of survivors, and the sudden extinction of
a myriad human hopes, all recorded in a single sentence
—was written: “In the storm of the 14th September
the emigrant vessel, Mrt/l Star, foundered off the South
Headland with all hands on board—supposed to have
sprung a leak." Then a few weeks later, the following
paragraph: “From the Nbrt/z Star, emigrant ship, sup-
posed to have been lost on the night of the 14th of last
month, with all hands on board, there came on shore at
Coveton, lashed to a spar, a solitary survivor, a young
woman. Although much exhausted and bruised, she
had received no vital injury, and her recovery is said
to be assured. Her case excites much interest in the
locality in question."
“The ‘solitary survivor ! ' ” continued my lady
thoughtfully. “Who is there to gainsay it, save this
man P ”
.“Your own heart, dearest mistress," answered the
waiting-maid solemnly. “That would not permit you to
deny him, even if your conscience would. Could you
meet him tomorrow face to face——”
“No, no," exclaimed my lady shuddering. “I never
could. I was mad to think of such a thing—so mad,
that I trust the wickedness of the thought may be for-

“About your watch, which ought to have come home
last evening, my lady.”
“Yes, my watch. There is not any time to lose.”
“Indeed not, dear mistress: not an hour, I should
say, if I were in your place. I tremble to look out of
window, lest I should see him coming yonder over the
Windmill Hill."
“Yes, ﬁxed as fate, and furious with her who has de-
ceived him. Poor fellow, who can blame him? I can
see him now.”
“ Heaven" forbid ! ” exclaimed the waiting-maid, ﬂeeing
to the window. “Haste, haste away, or there will be
murder done !"
“He is not there,” returned my lady in a low, calm
voice, “but 1 see him all the same. I’allid with scorn,
yet bent on avenging himself. Resolved to claim his
wife at any hazard, even in spite of herself. It will be
terrible that he should be here in any case; but if he
found me here, as you say, there might be murder done.
Not that I fear for myself, God knows : I am too wretched
for that."
“ Oh, my lady, had you not better start at once P”
“No, Mary; I must go ﬁrst to Dr. Haldane’s, since
the time has come. But iﬁ in the meantime, this— this
unhappy man should arrive, be sure you send the
carriage for me at once to the doctor’s house. I can
escape him that way for certain. Perhaps, then, I may
never cr0ss this threshold any more—never clasp my
dear ones in my arms and call them mine again—never
say: ‘My own Walter—Richard—Letty.’ How can I
bear to think upon it ! Don’t cry, Mary, for you see I
do not. You know what to do in case he comes; the
carriage to Dr. Haldane’s instantly: and afterwards—we
have settled that long ago.”
“I shall forget nothing, dearest mistress. If I live, all
will-be done that you have resolved upon."

“Dear Mary, trusty friend, may Heaven reward you."
My lady had her bonnet on by this time, but lifted up
her veil to kiss her faithful servant. “ If by God's
gracious will, somehow or other this misery should after
all have no evil end, Mary, how happy we shall be I
How we shall talk of this with our arms round one an-

one Great Heaven, what is that knocking? Can he

“ No, dearest, no,” sobbed the poor waiting-maid.
“ They are putting up the triumphal archway, that is all.”
She left the room to see that there was nobody in the
passage, or on the back stairs, by which her mistress was
about to leave the house.
“ The triumphal archway,” muttered my lady with tear-
less aching eyes. “ I would to Heaven they were putting
the nails into my coﬂin instead.”

CHAPTER XXXIV.
FLED.
Y lady returned to the Abbey at the usual
luncheon-hour, and partook of that meal (if
sitting at the table can be called so doing)
with the rest of the party ; while Mary Forest
kept watch at the boudoir window, with her mistress's
opera-glasses in her hand, scanning the Windmill Hill.
There was no likelihood of Derrick’s coming for hours
yet, since he had not arrived already by the same train
that had brought old Jacob’s letter; but there was just a
possibility of this. However, he did not come. The
unfrequented road, which on the morrow would be
thronged with the vehicles of Sir Richard’s guests, had


not a single passenger. It was“ one of the two \lvays we I ‘
have spoken of leading to Dalwynch, and the shorter in
point of distance, although not of time, because of the
winding hill ; but Derrick, coming from the direction of
Coveton not by the Dalwynch line, but another railway,
could approach Mirk by no other route.
Immediately after luncheon, the carriage drew up at
the door.
“ I will not offer to go with you, dearest mother,” said
Letty. “ because there is so much to do at home, and
the more because you will be absent yourself. But you
will come back as soon as you can—there’s a darling 1—-

won’t you ? Nothing goes on as it should at the Abbey
without you." ‘
“ Yes, dear Letty ! I will come back as soon as I
can.”
My lady cast a wistful look at her three children. She
would have given a thousand pounds to have thrown her
arms around their necks, and wept her ﬁll ; but such an
indulgence might have cost them and her far more than
that, or anything which money- could estimate. What if
her strength should fail her—if she should “ break down,”
as the saying is, at this supremest moment? She could
only trust herself to nod and smile.
The whole party went out to the front door to see her
off. The two young ladies standing on the hall steps
with their arms round one another’s waists (although I
much doubt if they had grown to be the friends that they
once were) ; Master Walter kissing his white hand to her
with all the grace and fondness of a lover ; Sir Richard
handing her into the carriage with stately but affectionate
courtesy. “ The lower road —to Level’s the watch-
makei’s in High Street," said he to the coachman, “ and
don't spare the horses.” Then, as the carriage drove
away, he observed to the others: “What a strange freak
it is of mamma to be going to Dalwynch at such a time
as this about her watch. However, she ought to be back
by ﬁve o’clock at latest.”
The carriage did return even before that hour 3 but it
did not contain my lady. It only brought back a letter
from her, which the footman was instructed to place at
once in the hands of her elder son. The man, however,
had some difﬁculty in ﬁnding Sir Richard, who was
superintending some ﬁnishing-touches that were being
given to the interior of the marquee—the arrangement
of certain ﬂags over the place he was to occupy on the
morrow. Sir Richard tore open the note, fearing he
knew not what; then uttered a tremendous oath. His
'people stared, for unlike some “young masters,” the
baronet scarcely ever misbehaved himself in that way.

“Where did you leave my Lady, sirrah?” inquired he
roughly of the footman.
“At the railway station, Sir Richard. Her ladyship
took the train for town.”
“Where is Miss Letty? Walter—Walter,” cried the
baronet, “ come here.”
“ Hollo, what is it?” answered the captain, a little
sulkily, for he was engaged in setting up an emblem
composed of various weapons of war at the other end
of the marquee: and pretty Polly, the gatekeeper’s
daughter, was handing him up certain highly-polished
swords, and he was playfully accusing her of using them
in transit as mirrors. “ You haven’t found out a mistake
in the almanac, and that you came of age the day before
yesterday, have you P”
“ Worse than that,” returned poor Sir Richard simply.
“Read that, man. What, in Heaven’s name, are we to
do now P ”
“Let us go in and see Letty,” said Walter gravely,
after he had read the note. “ Perhaps she knows some-
thing about it; and if not, you may take your oath that
Mary Forest does.”
“Do you, Walter? Don’t triﬂe with me," said the
baronet earnestly; “if any business respecting yourself
has taken my mother away, I conjure you to tell
me all.”
“No, Richard. I give you my word that I know of
no reason for this extraordinary conduct. It is true that
that letter from Moss Abrahams gave her some annoyance,
but that matter was settled long ago. I am as surprised
and dumbfounded as yourself.” 7

“The day after to-morrow,” rejoined Sir Richard
gloomily. “ What will to-morrow be without our mother P
Good Heaven, how dreadful is all this! Is it possible,
think you, to put the people off ? "
“ Utterly out of the question, Richard 3 we should re-
quire ﬁve hundred messengers."
They were walking on the lawn, and had now arrived
at one of the open windows of the great ball-room, a
splendid apartment, although the highly-decorated pink
ceiling had been likened by a pert young architect (who
wanted to persuade the baronet to let him pull down the
Abbey, and build another one) to the ornaments on a
twelfth-cake. Mrs. Walter, Letty, and Arthur Haldane
were all very busy here, but the last two not so entirely
occupied with the work in hand as to be unaware of one
another’s presence. At another time, Sir Richard would
have been annoyed at seeing them so close together, and
obviously so well pleased with the propinquity, but now
he was really glad to meet with the young barrister, for
whose judgment he had a great respect.
“ Letty—Arthur,” cried he, “read this. Do either of
you know, can either of you guess, what on earth it
means P "
“ Mamma not to be here to-morr‘ow !” ejaculated the
former, when she had read the note. “I can scarcely
believe my eyes.” But at the same time there came into
her mind that vague but saddening talk which her
mother had held with her but lately, when my lady had
said her malady was not one the doctors could cure.
Arthur read the note twice over, not so much to master
its contents, perhaps, as to frame his own reply to what
had been asked of him. '
“ I certainly do not know,” said he, “ what can have
taken your dear mother at such a time as this. We
may be sure, however, it is no mere freak of fancy,
' but that it is done for what she believes to be your
good.”
“Our goodl" broke forth Sir Richard impatiently.

“How can it be for good that I should be placed to-
morrow in a position the most embarrassing that can be
conceived? What am I to say when people ask me
‘Where is your mother?’ Imagine what they will
think of her absence on such an occasion, the most
important—~—-”
“Let us rather imagine, Richard,” interrupted Letty,
laying her hand upon his arm, “what our dear mother
must be suffering at this moment. As Arthur says, it can
be no trivial matter that takes her thus suddenly away
from us ; and although she may have over-estimated its
urgency, we may be sure that it is her anxiety for others
—-that is, for us—which has caused her to do so. Mamma
is incapable of a selﬁsh action.”
“ I am not speaking for myself alone, Letty,” returned
the baronet hotly.
“I did not accuse you of doing so, Richard. What
I mean is this, that however much you may feel this
misfortune, mamma has to bear the burden of its cause
-—whatever that may be—alone. She is thinking at this
moment of the alarm and sorrow she has eitcitcd here,
and we may be sure is feeling for us at least as much
as we feel for ourselves; and in addition to that, she
has this trouble to bear, at even the nature of which we
cannot guess."
Sir Richard frowned, and did not reply; but Arthur
unobserved stole Letty’s hand, and pressed it, in token
of his loving approval. “And who is the person who
is to give us the explanation on the 15th, think you?"
said Walter. “ I'll wager—or at least I would do so, if
I hadn’t given up betting—that Mistress Forest can tell
us if she would.”
“ Then let us send for her at once," cried Sir Richard
hastily; “ anything is better than this suspense."
When the servant called for this purpose had been de-
spatched : “ I do not presume,” said Arthur gravely, “to
dictate what is your duty; but if the case were mine,
Sir Richard, and my mother had expressly stated that

her motives would be explained at a certain date, I
should hardly like to extract them beforehand from 'her
conﬁdential servant. Forgive me, for I know I am ad-
dressing one who is himselfa man of the most scrupulous
honour."
The baronet bit his lip. “I don’t know, I’m sure,
Haldane. It is true, since my mother has gone to town,
that nothing we can do can bring her back in time for
‘ But at all events there can be no harm in asking
how long she is likely to be away—Ah, here is Mistress
Forest. We want to hear about my lady, Mary. She
has gone to London, it seems, and we are not to know
why until the day after tomorrow. Now, we are not
going to ask you her reasons.”
“Thank you, Sir Richard,” said Mistress Forest, her
puckered eyes looking really grateful.
“But what we do desire is, that you will tell us how
long she will be away.”
“ I am sure I can’t tell, Sir; Heaven knows I wish I
could,” answered the waiting-maid fervently. “ She sent
abig box over to Dalwynch by the carrier yesterday:
that’s all I know about it."
“Then she herself is not going to give us the ex-
planation in person, you think?" said the baronet
gloomily.
“No, Sir Richard: not in person,- at least I believe
not. Somebody else is going to do that for her."
“And you know who that will be?” returned the
young man sternly.
“ I think—at least, yes, I know, Sir; but it’s not me,”
added the waiting-maid hastily. “I hope I know my
place better than that. But my lady bade me say no-
thing about it, and, with all respect, wild horses should
not tear it from me." '
Here Mistress Forest, who had always entertained
considerable terror of her austere young master, could
not forbear casting a beseeching glance towards Arthur
Haldane.



## p. 319 (#325) ############################################

Flori. ' 319
“We already know from Mr. Haldane’s own lips,"
observed Sir Richard with emphasis, and looking in the
same direction, “that he is not in possession of the secret
of my lady’s departure.”
“I certainly said as much,” returned Arthur haughtily;
and with that, either because he was really annoyed, or
did not wish to be further questioned, he stepped out
upon the lawn, and walked away.
“ All this is very unsatisfactory, and strangeyand bad,”
said the baronet, after a considerable pause. “ But no-
thing is to be got, it seems, by asking questions. We
must do then the best we can for to-morrow without my
mother—you, Letty, assisted by Mrs. Walter here, must
do the honours of the Abbey in her place-and I wish
to Heaven," added he, as he turned upon his heel, “that
the day was well over.”
“What a nice agreeable temper Richard has, when
anything goes wrong," observed Walter, twirling his
moustaches. “ I’m hanged if I don’t think it's that
which has driven my mother away from home. She
naturally enough concludes he will be unbearable when -
he becomes the master."
“1"ie, ﬁe, Walter!” said Letty. “I think it is much
more likely that she can no longer bear to listen to the
cruel things she hears her two sons say of one another.
She has spoken to me of it more than once of late with
tears in her eyes.”
“ Well, Sir Richard Iza: a bad temper, Letty, there’s
no doubt about that,” observed Mrs. ‘Walter, striking in
in defence of her husband.
“Yes; yet there are many things worse than that,
Rose, and mamma has been accustomed to Richard all
his life; but she has had trouble upon trouble for the
last six months, as I am sure you cannot daily, and it is
likely in the state of health to .which I know she is re-
duced, that she feels herself totally unequal to the part
she would be expected to play to-morrow.”
“I think Mr. Haldane knows more of the matter than

he chooses to say,” observed Rose, at once carrying the
war into the enemy’s camp.
“I don’t think you quite understand him," returned
Letty, executing the same strategic movement; “any-
thing like duplicity is altogether foreign to his cha-
racter."
“ He looks simple enough certainly,” remarked Rose
quietly. “But I noticed that when Sir Richard asked
him whether he knew, or could guess what had taken
Lady Lisgard from home, he conﬁned himself to reply-
ing that he did not know.”
Letty made no answer, but applied herself with
heightened 'colour to the occupation in which her
brothers had interrupted her. Walter smiled sardoni-
cally, thinking of certain female savages he had been
reading of that morning in some paper in the E'eld
aprapas of riﬂe-grooves, who were expert in propelling
poisoned darts from blow-pipes ; then catching sight of
his handsome face in one of the mirrors with which
the ball-room was wainscoted, he nodded, as though he
recognised some friend he was constantly in the habit
of meeting, yet was always glad to see, and sauntered
out.
At ﬁrst, he made mechanically for the marquee, but
stopping himself, not as it seemed without some con-
tention in his own mind, he turned his steps to some
other part of the park. “ No,” said he to himself gaily,
“I will be a. good boy. It is true, I have had devilish
hard lines lately, but then it was partly deserved. Now,
the poor mother has had just as hard, and has not de-
served them a bit. I will do nothing that can cause her
trouble now—not even run the risk of a bit of harmless
flirtation, for there always is a risk about that, somehow.
I wonder whether Letty was right about her going
away; I‘m sure I can’t help Richard quarrelling with
me—he will do it. And then there was that matter of
Moss Abraham’s—upon my life it must have been very
trying to the dear old lady. And then there was my

“v—ﬁ LD Jacob Forest had made a well-grounded
complaint when he cried out with such vehe-
i_ ‘ mence that that fellow Derrick had actually
left the front door open, and the guard-ship
and his rheumatism more exposed to the rigour of the
elements even than usual: but to do his visitor justice,
this rudeness was not committed with intention; Ralph
knew not what he was doing; he was out of his mind

of violets from where he had placed them so tenderly but
an hour before; “ so she was false, too, like the rest of

How dared she do it P—she that is a God-fearing woman,
forsooth! But I suppose that all is fair against a casta-
way. Let her look to it, now, though. Ralph Gavestone

punity—far less to be cajoled, betrayed, insulted, wronged 1
Richard Lisgard, too !—Sir Richard, as the bastard calls
himself !—_your hour of bitterness is drawing nigh too, and
I will not spare you. There is no memory now of the
beloved dead to stay my hand ; there is the knowledge of
the treacherous living to make the blow all the surer and
the more fatal. Love—nay, even the impress of where I
thought love had lain within me, but it was not so—is
cancelled out, and Mercy with it. Friendship—bah, I
have found out what that is worth! There is nothing left

Sir Richard, for yet a few hours more, among your
truckling neighbours, your fawning tenants, for your time
is short indeed. They may be your humble and obedient
servants still, but what will they think of you, what will
they say of you, behind your back, when they come to
learn who you are? If your mother has the right to rule
at Mirk, then I will rule there too: and you shall serve,
and if not—then she is my wife still, and leaves you for
me. 77:00 will be a downfall for your pride! Lady

those—and forced to be once more plain Lucy Gavestone,

to be termed ‘ Madam.’ The law will give her to me':
there is no doubt of that. The righteous law, which is to
be always upheld—remember that, my game-preserving
friend—no matter what hardships it may entail upon
individuals, or even what injustice it may commit in
exceptional cases. How sweet it is to remember such
words of wisdom, against which, in my ignorance, I was
wont to ﬁght tooth and nail. You will not forbid me

wife. To-morrow, or next day at furthest, will introduce
you to your stepfather! for I have made up my mind to
acknowledge you, just as though you had been born in
lawful wedlock."
Breathing forth these cruel threats, and feeding upon
their fulﬁlment in his mind, Ralph Derrick lay awake for
hours in his chamber at the Royal Marine, and had hardly
fallen asleep when the omnibus started fer the morning
train. The horn, and noise of the wheels aroused him,
and he leaped up out of bed with an oath, because he
knew that he had missed that, his earliest opportunity, of
getting to Mirk. However, having rung his bell, he
learned from the waiter that it would be quite possible
yet, by taking a carriage and four horses, to reach the junc-
'on before the Coveton train, which, besides, had to wait
t ere for the midday-mail. “ Of course,” said the waiter,
rubbing his hands, and speaking with a hesitation induced
by the contemplation of Ralph's scanty kit, “it will be a.
very considerable expense, and perhaps "
“Curse the expense, and you too I” ejaculated the
whilom gold-digger in his old ﬂaming manner. “ Here's a
ten~poi1nd note ; and let my bill be settled and the horses
put to within ﬁve minutes.”
“ But your breakfast, Sir?”
“A glass of brandy and a piece of bread; that’s all I
want; quick, quick l”
The waiter departed at full speed—his anxiety to
execute Derrick's orders being at least equalled by his
desire to communicate them to his mistress and the
chambermaids. They were only accustomed at the Royal
Marine to the Newly Married, who were rarely in a hurry,
and never broke their fast upon brandy and bread; and
to these Ralph certainly afforded a lively contrast.
The four horses carried him along at a great rate, and
the old-fashioned carriage swung from side to side
down every hill, so that if motion could have soothed his
perturbed spirit, on the principle of like to like, it should
have grown calmer with every mile. But fast as he sped,

The U 11in w'lz’d G 110:1. 3 2 5
his thoughts ﬂew on before him—and in them he was
already at Mirk Abbey, denunciating, exposing, avenging,
- until physical inaction became intolerable, and thrusting
his head and shoulders out at the window, he bade the
astonished post-boys pull up, and let him out, for that he
would have no more of such travel. Then once more he
pursued his way on foot, and had walked two-score of
miles before he put up for the night, at one of the same
inns at which he had stopped upon his way down to
Coveton.
But exercise, even in this violent degree, could now no
longer avail him. He was still consumed with bitter-
ness and anger, and the desire of vengeance. He could
not sleep; and he had lost all appetite for food. He
drank, as he had never drunk since he was in Cariboo ;
glass after glass of raw spirits, t0 the wonder of his
tolerably well-seasoned host, who looked to have him for
quite a permanent guest, overtaken, as it seemed must
come to pass, by delirium tremens. Brandy, however,
could now affect him nothing; except perhaps that it
added fuel to his rage. On the third day, he grew im-
patient of his slow progress, and took the train upon a
line of rails that brought him within a dozen miles of
Mirk. As soon as he got out at the station, he inquired
for a vehicle to take him to his journey’s end.
“You wish to go to Mirk Abbey, do you not, Sir?"
said the porter respectfully (for Ralph always travelled
ﬁrst-class). '
“That’s my business, and not yours,” retorted Derrick,
angrily, but without surprise; for it seemed 'to him
natural enough that the purpose which was consuming
his whole being should be recognised in his external
features. .
“ Nay, Sir; I meant no hann. It is not business, but
pleasure, that is taking all the world to Mirk to-day.
Everything here that has four wheels, and even that has
two, has been already engaged; but if you don’t mind
waiting an hour or so, there will be a return-ﬂy _’_’

But, with a contemptuous oath, Ralph had already
resumed his journey on foot, looking neither to left nor
right, but keeping his eyes steadfastly ﬁxed on the wind-
mill, he could even now see afar oﬂ", and which he knew
crowned Mirkland Hill. The afternoon was already
far spent, and by the time he reached the spot in question
the dusk had already deepened into dark. On one side
of the road lay the white gate and little hedge belonging
to Belcomb; on the other, the great windmill, with its
dilapidated wall still unrepaired, and over which a young
man was leaning and looking towards the valley with
longing eyes. Ralph followed the direction of his gaze,
and perceived the noble outlines of Mirk Abbey “picked
out" in lines of many-coloured ﬂame—its every window
aglow with light, and the shadowy park itself islanded
with two large shining spots, which old experience taught
him at once were walls of canvas well lit up within.
“What is going on there?" asked he of the miller,
for such the young man’s dress proclaimed him to be.
“ Why, victuals and drink, to be sure," replied the led,
in a tone that bespeaks a grievance ; and music, and
pretty girls to dance to it, and ﬁreworks, and I don’t
know what all. And here am I, the only young
man in the parish that is not to enjoy himself at
it: just because Master Hathaway happens to have a
pressing order in hand, I am to keep the mill going all
to-night. I don’t say I wishes it to rain—for that would
spoil everybody’s sport—but if the wind would be so good
as to fall, and stop the mill, why, I wouldn’t whistle to
try and set it agoing again.”
“ Yes, by-the-bye,” said Ralph, “I heard something at
the station about some goings-on at Mirk, butI didn’t
take much heed. What is it, lad P And why are they all
so gay down yonder at the Abbey? "
“Why, it’s Sir Richard coming of age, to be sure,"
answered the lad. “You must hail from a darned long
way oﬁ”. not to know that; and yet I seem to know your
face. Why, you’re Mr. Derrick, aint you, as used to

lodge at the Lisgard Arms? I thought so. Well, you’ll
ﬁnd nobody there now, for Steve has been taken into
favour again—thanks to my lady, I believe—and is up at
the park with the rest; and they won't let you into the
grounds, you know 3 so you might just as well stop here,
and have achat with a poor fellow as
Striking his stick with violence against the ground,
Ralph strode away down the hill. This, then, was the
very time for him to come upon the inmates of Mirk
Abbey, while theywere holding their heads highest, and to
cast them down to the very dust. If his determination
had needed strength, if the sharpness of his revenge had
wanted an edge, both had been supplied by the careless
words of the miller's boy.
Before the night was out, not only that lad, but all the
parish, nay, all the county, should learn that he, Ralph
Derrick, could not only be no longer forbidden to enter
the Lisgards’ doors, but would perhaps even rule within
them as the husband of my lady herself.
The village, as he had been forewarned, was as deserted
as Auburn itself, and the inn fast closed. But the iron
gates of the Abbey were ﬂung back, as though to welcome
all comers, and the rheumatic lodge-keeper and his wife
had betaken themselves with their pretty daughter to the
festive scene within. So Ralph strode, undenied, up the
long dense avenue, made darker by the glancing lights at
the far end, like some embodiment of misfortune, about
to paralyse youth and hope with a word. The fairy-like
splendours of the scene before him seemed to him like a
house of painted cards, which, at his ﬁnger-touch, should
collapse in utter ruin; his frown should silence all those
melodies that jarred so on his reluctant cars ; that merri-
ment should be turned into wailing, or still better, into
scornful laughter. The scene of pride should be made a
place of shame.
No one of all the crowd of holiday-makers seemed to
take notice of his presence, though he carried with him,
from spot to spot, the only scowling face that was to be

seen among them. He stood at the opening of the great
marquee, and watched the dancers ; his evil eye scanned
each gay couple as they whirled before him, but settled
upon none whom it had come to wither. Sir Richard and
his brother had inaugurated the proceedings there by
taking part in a few dances, but had then withdrawn
themselves to the ball-room within. In the second tent,
reserved for the humblest class of guests, the mirth was
already growing somewhat uproarious; but there was one
among the company, who, though he took two glasses for
other folk’s one, looked as sober as an undertaker ; and
Derrick came behind this man and plucked his arm.
“Steve,” said he, “I want a word with you. Come
out with me, and leave these capering idiots.”
The landlord of the Lisgard Arm: did not even make
a pretence of being glad to recognise his late lodger: he
had been received, as Hathaway’s lad had stated, into
favour at the Abbey once more, thrOugh the intercession
of my lady, but he was still upon his good-behaviour, and
it excessively annoyed him to see the original cause of
Sir Richard's displeasure with himself once more at
Mirk, and intruding where he was least welcome.
However, the two withdrew together apart from the
crowd. ,
“What is it, Derrick? I think- it is foolish of you
venturing here. I am sorry to say that I have promised
not to receive you again at my inn. I did not dream of
your coming back, or else I would never have done
so.” '
“Don’t trouble yourself about that, Steve. If I stay
at Mirk at all, it will be here, at the Abbey.”
“At the Abbey! You have been drinking, Derrick.
Now, take my advice, and be off; at all events, for the
present. To-day, when everybody is being entertained
by Sir Richard, folks would resent any insult put upon
the family, I can promise you—it’s the worst day you
could possibly have selected to force your way in here."
“ N 0, Steve, the best day—the only day. I would

have given ten thousand pounds, I tell you, rather than
have missed it, or have am'ved to-morrow instead."
“I am glad you are so rich, man,” returned Steve
drily, “for it is the impression down here that you lost
all your money upon that French horse at the Derby;
poor Master Walter, too, you led him into a pretty mess,
it seems.”
“Curse Master Walter !” ejaculated Derrick angrily. -
“ He’s a mean skunk, if ever there was one.”
“ People don't think so hereabouts, Mr. Derrick; and
I should recommend you not to express your opinion
quite so loudly. If any of these volunteers heard you
speaking of their captain in that way, you would not
escape with a whole skin.”
“ That’s my look-out,” answered Derrick roughly. “I
want you to tell me where I can ﬁnd Sir Richard. I
have particular business with him; something for his
private ear.”
“It isn’t about my lady, is it?” inquired the other
eagerly.
“ Yes, it is. How came you to think of that? Eh? ”
“ How could I be off on it, man? Is she not the
uppermost thought of everybody here? Do you really
bring any news of her? And, look you, if it’s bad news,
don’t tell it. I don’t like that ugly look of yours, Mr.
Derrick. If you have done any harm to my lady, I, for
one, will help to wring your neck round."
“ Do you mean to say she is not here?” gasped Ralph,
without heeding his last words.
“Of course not; didn’t you know that? She’s gone
away, all of a sudden. Sir Richard quite broke down
when he alluded to it in his speech. He said that urgent
business had compelled her to be in London ; but
Roberts told me that the family themselves have no idea
why she took herself otf ”
“ Ah, but they do though,” exclaimed Derrick scorn-
fully. “ And I know, too, or I’m much mistaken. She’s
trying l/zat dodge on, is she? Not at home, eh? And

she supposes that I shall leave my card, and go away
like any other well-conducted visitor. She’ll ﬁnd me an
acquaintance whom it is not so easy to drop, I fancy.
So my lady has ﬂed, has she P ” continued he. “ Hadn’t
the pluck to blazon it out, eh? She won’t, however, have
ﬂown very far from her young chicks, I reckon. And,
perhaps, it’s just as well that I should cut the comb
of this young bantam, Sir Richard, while his mother’s
out of the way ; not that I feel an ounce of pity for her
either."
“You’ll feel a horsewhip about your shoulders, Ralph
Derrick, before you’re a quarter of an hour older, or else
I’m much mistaken,” observed Steve ruefully. “I’ll have
nothing more to say to you, and that’s a fact. You are
not only drunk, but stark mad. I never heard a fellow
go on with such a farrago of rubbish. Look here, if
you'll come home with me at once, you shall have as
much brandy as you can drink; but you shan’t kick up
a row here. See, one of the ball-room windows is wide
open, and Sir Richard himself, for all you know, may
Confound the fellow, it will be only kindness to tell
Styles, the policeman, to take him up.”
Derrick had burst away from Steve, and was running
across the lawn to the very place where the Lisgard
family had discussed their mother’s departure upon the
preceding evening.

CHAPTER XXXVI.
OUT OF THE CAGE.
i"; 1- \ HE immense ball-room was now a blaze of light,
_i'" and full, though by no means crowded, with
brilliant company. One of the windows, as
Steve had said, had been thrown up, and
through it the scene was as distinctly displayed to Ralph
as though he were within. He stood there alone, for a
feeling of respect kept others from the immediate neigh-
bourhood. He beheld fair Letty, hostess and belle in
onc, moving from group to group, who broke out into
smiles at her approach; he beheld dark Rose whirl by
“in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls "—the self-same
“parure” which had enslaved poor Anne Rees—and
followed by many an admiring eye. He beheld Master
Walter’s smiling face bent down to whisper to some
blushing girl, who forgot, perhaps, for the moment that
the handsome captain was already married—that he had
been entrapped by that scheming young person with the
extremely self-conﬁdent manner. Lastly, he beheld the
man he sought talking with a gentleman of apoplectic
habit, and the air of a prosperous licensed victualler, but
who was no less a personage than the Earl of Marrobone,
and Lord-lieutenant of Wheatshire. His lordship had
sought the open window for fresh air, and the two were
conversing upon county matters, in which Sir Richard,
young as he was, already took the keenest interest

“You will take your seat on the bench at once, Sir
Richard, I hope,” were the ﬁrst words which Derrick
caught. “Your commission is, of course, already made
out, and you will probably receive it to-morrow."
“ I thank you, my lord. Yes, I shall make a point of
being a regular attendant at the petty sessions.”
“And you will be wanted, too, at Dalwynch ; for be-
tween ourselves, the old general yonder is a little past
his work in that way. I don’t wish to prejudice you, I
am sure, against a man in such a respectable position ;
but the fact is, he and I are not such good friends as we
might be. He wants me to make Mr. Chesham—you
know, of course, who that is, the relation in which they
stand to one another, and so on—a magistrate for the
county. Now, I do think that that is a distinction which
should never be conferred upon any natural son—that is,
unless the family of the father should be really of mark,
which is not the case with our friend the general, what-
ever may be said of Lady Theresa. I don’t think, be-
cause a man has married into the peerage, that he should
therefore be himself admitted to all the privileges of good
birth." /
“With all deference, my lord,” returned Sir Richard
stifﬁy, “ I consider that under no circumstances whatever,
no matter whether the father be peer or commoner,
should the commission of the peace be conferred upon a.
bastard.”
“Then Richard Lisgard must never sit upon the bench
at Dalwynch 1” exclaimed a malignant voice close beside
the speaker. ’
In an instant, Sir Richard was upon 'the lawn without,
face to face with his insulter. No one in the ball-room,
save the two gentlemen who had been conversing to-
gether, had overheard the exclamation, and his lordship
had not caught it distinctly. The band was playing on,
as accurately as before, and the dancers were dancing in
tune; the cavaliers were whispering their soft nothings,
and the ladies making their sweet replies, while the two

men without—the one so scrupulously apparelled in the
latest fashion, the other dishevelled, travel-stained, and
in all respects what we call “a rough,” but both as
brave as lions —were grappling one another by their
throats. Sir Richard, who never forgot any man’s face
—a faculty not uncommon with persons of his class and
character—had recognised Ralph Derrick, the turbulent
interloper in his parish, the evil counsellor of his brother,
at the ﬁrst glance ; and enraged at his audacious trespass
at such a time, quite as much as by his late brutal insult
to himself, which he set down as the result of drink, he
threw himself upon the gold-digger with the utmost fury.
The Earl of Marrobone stepped outside also, and closed
behind him the ball-room window; the stout old noble-
man was one of the coolest hands in England, and never
lost his presence of mind. Even thus debarred from
making that public exposure of the young baronet which
Derrick had promised himself, he might have said some-
thing which his lordship would not have forgotten—for
he was one of those who had seen too much of the world
to believe anything untrue merely because it seemed
impossible—but that, at the ﬁrst touch of Sir Richard’s
ﬁngers, Ralph’s fury deprived him of all utterance except
a few desperate imprecations. He would have liked,
with folded arms, to have impeached the young baronet
as a base-born impostor (for he felt convinced that the
reason for my lady’s ﬂight was known to him and the rest
of the family), and have stated his own wrongs in a few
earnest and pregnant words before the whole company in
yonder room ; but now that he had his enemy so close,
“the blind wild beast of force within him, whose home
is in the sinews of a man," was driven to strike and
strike again. So the precious half minute, that elapsed
before help came to Sir Richard, was wasted, and Derrick
found himself helpless, and with his wrongs untold, in
the clutch of half-a-dozen men, and one of them the '
village policeman, whom Steve had found at last, and
despatched for that very purpose.

“Take him and lock him up,” exclaimed Lord Marro-
bone, perceiving that Sir Richard was too excited to
speak. “A night in the watch-house will sober the
drunken brute, and cool his courage. Take him away, I
say," for Ralph began to weave afresh his choicest
ﬂowers of speech—mere onion-ropes of the wickedest .
words—“ and put the foul-mouthed scoundrel into quod l " :
So they bore Ralph forth, not without very rough treat-
ment, through the gates, and cast him into a small but
well-secured tenement, known as “the Cage," but so
seldom used in the orderly little village, that it was in
the Occupation of a certain white rabbit and her family
(pets of the constable’s children), who had to be ejected,
to make room for this very different tenant.
Sir Richard Lisgard went up stairs to reﬁt, and re—
turned to the ball-room, where none had even remarked
his absence, with an unimpeachable white cravat conceal-
ing an ugly bruise upon his windpipe ,- but all smiles had
departed from his noble features, and it was observed by
Mrs. Walter Lisgard, in conﬁdential conversation with
the Honourable Poppin Jay, that her dear brother-in-law
looked more like Don Quixote de la Mancha even than
usual. He had made up his mind that, under the cir-
cumstances, it was impossible he could be upon the
bench of magistrates while Derrick’s case was being
entered into, and was disturbed by the apprehension that
the old general would not look upon the matter in a
sufﬁciently important light, or punish the offender with
all the rigour of the law.
By no means quietly, however, had the affair passed
OE without doors. There was nothing, according to
rumour, which drunken Derrick had not done in the way
of misbehaviour towards the young baronet, from bad
words to the use of a bowie-knife, and nothing which he
did not deserve. The news ﬂew from mouth to mouth
like wildﬁre ; the tenantry, the peasantry, and the house-
hold were all in possession of the facts—and of very
much more than the facts, within half an hour of their

real or supposed occurrence. Last of all to hear it was
Mistress Forest, for whom a wholesome respect was en-
tertained by all the domestics, and to whom, being
notoriously the object of Derrick’s affections, it was of
course a delicate matter to communicate such intelli~
gence.
Little Anne Rees, however, stole up stairs to Mary's own
room, where she knew my lady's waiting-maid was sitting,
far from all the noise and gaiety, and thinking sadly of
her poor dear mistress and her troubles. “ Oh Ma’am,
please Ma'am, such a dreadful thing have happened!"
said she. “Mr. Derrick have come back again.-—Don’t
ye faint; don’t ye take on so " (for Mistress Forest had
turned as white as Anne’s own apron) ; “he’s not dead.
But he’s gone and pitched into Sir Richard before all the
company, and they fought together dreadful, I don’tknow
how long."
“What did he say, girl?” exclaimed Mistress Forest
eagerly; “ I mean, what did they ﬁght about? "
“Well, he did not say much, didn’t Mr. Derrick,
beyond cussing most uncommon strong. It took six on
’em to carry him away, for all the world like a corpse,
except for his kicking and swearing; and when they said
he would be up before the bench on Thursday, he said
‘ He wished it was to-morrow, that was all ;' and at the
same time he laughed that wicked, that it went quite
cold to the small of my back.”
“And where have they put the poor man, after all P "
“In the cage, Ma’am. The key was not to be found,
but they’ve barred him up just like a wild beast. And
oh, Mistress Forest, it isn‘t my place, and I ask your
pardon, but don’t you give him no more encouragement,
for he is a wild beast, and nothing less, if you could only
see him.”
“That will do, Anne; though I’m obliged to you for
coming to tell me. I must speak to Sir Richard to-
morrow, and try and beg him off. Good-night."
“And aren't you coming down to supper, nor to see

the ﬁreworks, nor nothing?” inquired the little maid in
amazement.
“No, Anne ,- I was not in a humour for such things
before, and certainly I am not so now. I am going to
bed."
But no sooner had the grateful little girl—who, though
she waited no longer on Mrs. Walter (who had brought
her own maid with her), yet always remembered that she
owed her enfranchisement to Mistress Forest—gone
down stairs, than Mary took up her bonnet and cloak,
and hurried softly after her. It was impossible not to
meet persons at every turn ; but it was not difﬁcult, in
the general hubbub and excitement, to avoid their obser,
vation ,' and this she did. The night was very dark ,-
and once away from the gleam and glitter of the house
and lawn, Mary had to slacken her pace even down the
avenue she knew so well. When she was half-way down
it, as nearly as she could guess, she heard a noisy throng
of men approaching from the other direction, and shrank
on one side, behind a tree. Some of them carried
Lanterns, and as they went by, she recognised Styles, the
rural policeman, and also Mr. Steve.
“I am as sorry as can be," the latter was saying, “and
would much rather see the poor fellow well away.”
“Take care you go no further that wishing, however,”
responded the guardian of the law. “It would be a bad
night’s work for any man who should let that fellow out,
mind you: ordered into custody by the Lord-lieutenant
hisself, and charged with assault and battery of a baro-
knight—I never set eyes on such an owdacious scamp."
“ He’s simply mad, that’s all,” returned Steve, sadly—
“ mad with drink. For whoever heard one in his senses,
or even drunk in a natural way, talk such infernal rub-
bish ! Didn’t he say he was ‘my lady’s husband ! ’ "
The answer was drowned in a great shout of laughter,
and so the men passed on. Mary waited until she was
sure there were no more to come, then walked on with
her arms outstretched before her, as fast as she dared go.

Suddenlythere was a sharp and rusty shriek behind her, -
and a glare of lurid light which showed her the gateway
right in front.
“ They have begun to ﬁre the rockets,” muttered she ;
“ so there will be nobody in the village, that is certain.”
The little street, much lighter than the way by which she
had hitherto come, was indeed quite empty, but by no
means noiseless ; a. sound of confused shouting came
dully up from the bottom of the hill, where, as she well
knew, the cage was situated; and truly, as Anne Rees
had said, it struck upon the car like the roaring of some
angry beast making night hideous. Mary stopped for a
moment to listen ,' and when she went on, her face was
paler, though not less determined-looking than before.
“Sir Richard is a bastard—a bastard—a bastard I My
lady is not nearly so good as she should be; and I'm
her husband in the lock-up ! Down with the Lisgards—
down with them ; and down they shall come I "
These were the words, but interspersed with the most
hideous imprecations, with which Mistress Forest’s ears
were greeted as she approached the little round house.
Taking advantage of a momentary pause in the stream of
denunciation, she knocked with her clenched hand at the
nail-studded door.
“Sir Richard is a bastard! no more Sir Richard than
you are l" shrieked the voice within. “Be sure you go
to the magistrates’ meeting at Dalwynch on Thursday,
and let all Mirk go with you; then shall you see pride
have a fall, and the Lisgards come down with a run !
Down with them—down with them—and down they
shall come 1"
“ Ralph—Ralph Derrick, it is me.”
“ Who's me? a woman P ” inquired the prisoner eagerly.
“ Then I’ll tell you about my lady, because you’ll enjoy
it. She’s not my lady ; she’s no more my lady than you
are."
“Ralph Gavestone, I know that," answered Mistress
Forest, with her mouth glued to a crack in the door.

“Oh, you know that, do you ? Then you must be the
devil, whom I have lately suspected to be of the female
gender, and am now convinced of it. You are of course
aware, then, that I am her husband P ”
“Yes, I am.-—Will you be quiet, and go away to
Dalwynch, and not try to enter the Abbey grounds again
this night, if I let you out P "
“Certainly. To-day is Tuesday, or it was so before
midnight. I shall therefore have to wait for my revenge
till Thursday, if I am not set free; whereas, if you let
me out, I can go to work at once; I can see an
attorney to-morrow morning. That should please you
rarely, if you are indeed the devil. There’s another
bolt still over the hole through which I kicked Steve’s
leg. I left_my mark on some of them, mind you—R. G."
Mary Forest had opened the cage; and behold there
stood her whilom lover, bleeding and ragged, his red
beard plucked a thousand ways, his features haggard,
his eyes ﬂaming with rage and hate.
“ Oh, it’s you, is it P ” said he, with something of softness
in his turbid but vehement speech. “ I might have
known that, if I had thought a little. But it's no good,
my partridge—plump still, though a little gray. I’m
meat for your mistress now; I am the master of Mirk ;
or at least I shall be in a day or two. I’m her ladyship’s
husband—better luck than she deserves, you’ll think ; and
I can’t be two women’s husband at the same time, any
more than my lady could have two mates. That was her
little mistake, for which she is about to reap the fruits.
Sir Richard is a bastard—a bastard—a bastard ! ”
“You said that if I unbarred this door, you would start
,for Dalwynch,” observed Mistress Forest ﬁrmly. “You
used to be a man whose word could be relied on. Why
do you not go P”
“I am going at once, my plump one. You have re-
venged yourself and me at the same time. There is no
kindness in this, I well understand, you know 3 there is
no such thing as kindness in the world."

“ You are wrong there, Ralph Gavestone. It is because
I love my mistress, rather than pity you—although I do
pity you still—that I have come hither to save you from
a night’s lodging in such a place. It would have grieved
my mistress to the heart to think you were so served, I
know." '
“To the wizal? ” returned Ralph with a savage laugh.
“To her lzeart, did you say? Why, the thing doesn’t
exist, wench! If, however, there does still cling to her
anything of the sort, when I tell them that Sir Richard’s
a bastard, that’ll wring it.”
“ Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy,"
cried Mistress Forest, terriﬁed at the deadly menace of
his tone, and uttering her words as though they were a
charm against an evil spirit.
“Blessed are the merciful ! " echoed Ralph bitterly.
“That may be so, for I have never known them 3 but
cursed are the treacherous and the false! You have
heard of the avenging angel—well, though my wings are
so tattered and torn just now, that's me. Do you see
the mimic lightning yonder over the Abbey P It will be
stricken to-morrow from turret to basement by a forked
shaft. Down with the Lisgards, and down they shall
come ! "
Shrieking this to a sort of frenzied measure, he suddenly
broke away, and took the Dalwynch road, up Mirkland
Hill. Mary listened with some feeling of relief to his
fading strains, then sighed, and wiped from her eyes a few
honest tears.
“He was not always abad man, I am sure,” soliloquised
she pitifully, “and now God forgive him—he knows not
what he’s doing! He is mad."

CHAPTER XXXVII.
THE RECONCILIATION.
~- \ HE day after a great festivity in a great house is
' generally a dull one. It begins late; for both
servants and guests are wearied, and there is
nothing about it which is not inferior to other
days except the luncheon, which in the way of “ sweets,"
at all events, is always exceptionally good. Sir Richard,
however, who went through life as nearly as could be to
an automaton, was up at his usual time ; and descending
to the empty breakfast-room, beheld, seated in an arm-
chair, which he had wheeled to the window, a little
wizened old man, in brightest Hessian boots, drab
breeches, and a cut-away coat with ﬂap-pockets of the
fashion of half a century ago.
“Dr. Haldane ! ” exclaimed the young man in extreme
amazement. “God bless my soul and body ! "
“_I hope he will, Sir," rejoined the visitor drily, extend-
ing three ﬁngers somewhat stiﬁly.
“No, Sir; surely your whole hand 1 ” cried the baronet
warmly. “ Your face is the pleasantest sight—save that
of my dear mother’s—that I could hope to set eyes on in '
Mirk Abbey ; and I am not going to be fobbed off with
such a salutation as that.”
“ You get nothing more from me, Richard, unless the
business I have come about—very much against the
gram, I can tell you—gets satisfactorily accomplished.”

“ Does it relate to my dear mother, Sir? ”
“ Of course it does, young man. What else, do you
think, would have had poWer to break my resolution—t0
bring me hither—to this room, in which I have not set
foot these twenty years, and where I last sat, side by side
—with—- But what is that to you ? I suppose a man
is not very likely to be moved by the memories of a dead
father, who pays no respect to the feelings of his living
mother."
“I am not aware, Dr. Haldane,” began Sir Richard
with some haughtiness.
“I know that, Sir," broke in the other impetuously.
“You are so wrapped up in selﬁshness—you and that
scampish brother of yours—that neither of you have any
thought except for your own miserable quarrels. You
were not aware, I dare say, that their constant repetition
is driving your mother into her grave, as they have already
driven her from her once happy home ; and it is because
you don’t know it—because you won’t see it--that
I am come hither, once for all, to inform you of the fact.
But perhaps such a little matter has no interest in your
eyes : in which case, I assure you, since it is entirely for
her sake, and not at all for yours, that I have come, I
shall be exceedingly glad to go away again."
“ Have you any message to deliver, Dr. Haldane,"
asked the baronet with an angry flush, “ direct from my
mother, or are you merely stating your own doubtless
valuable, but quite unasked-for opinions ? ”
“ I have a message from her to deliver to you, and to
the rest of you, young man; and if you think it worth
while to send for your brother and sister, you had better
do so."
The young man rang the bell, and gave the necessary
orders. Dr. Haldane took up a book of family prayers
that lay beside him, and grunted cynically as he read Sir
Richard’s name on the title-page. “What a work for a
fellow like this to write his name in, who drives his
mother out of her own house !" muttered he, and then

affected to be immersed in the contents. The baronet
did not reply, but occupied himself in opening his letters,
one of which was from Madame de Castellan. That lady
expressed herself as “desolated " at the news of her old
friend's departure from the Abbey, the cause of which she
was dying to hear. “If, however," ran the postscript,
“the absence of my lady was for any reason likely to
continue, might not Mary Forest be despatched, at all
events in the meantime, to Belcomb, where Madame was
absolutely without any waiting-maid at all—with the ex-
ception of old Rachel—until another could be procured
from France, to supply the place of wicked Annette,
departed almost without a word of warning."
“ Cunning old wretch ! " murmured Sir Richard, crump
ling up the pale thin paper with its scratchy foreign
caligraphy, and throwing it into the grate. “She thinks
of nothing but herself." '
“How odd!” exclaimed the little doctor bitterly.
“The lady’s case must be quite unique.”
Not a word more was spoken by either until Letty
entered, a little pale, but looking exquisitely lovely.
“Dear Dr. Haldane, who would have thought of seeing
you lwrc? How pleased I am !”
The doctor rose with alacrity from his seat, and kissed
her affectionately upon the forehead.
“ I am sure, said she with earnest gravity, “ that you
have brought us news of dearest mamma.”
“So you have thought of her, have you, little one?"
answered he fondly. (Letty was about three inches
taller than the doctor.) “I fancied she would have
been no longer missed. Everybody was so happy here
yesterday, I am told 3 and everything went on so well
without her."
“It did not, indeed," returned Letty indignantly.
“Nothing seemed to go right in her absence, notwith-
standing all I could do; and as for being happy, I can
answer for myself and my brothers, that not ﬁve
minutes elapsed all day without our thinking of her,

and grieving for her loss. And oh, dear Dr. Haldane,
do you know why she has left us in this sad manner,
and when we shall see her back again? "
“I have her own explanation of why she has left
Mirk Abbey," replied the doctor; “but as for her return,
that will depend upon yourselves—I mean upon Sir
Richard and Captain Lisgard. For you, Letty, she bids
me say have been at all times what a loving child should
be to a parent—Master Walter, your servant, Sin—No,
I will not shake hands with a man who ruins his mother
by gambling debts, and breaks her heart with hatred
of his own brother."
“That is not true, at least I do hope, Walter!” said
Sir Richard quickly.
“No ; false, upon my honour,” returned the captain.
“ My mother never told you to say that, Sir." .
“Not quite that—no, she did not,” admitted the
little old man, whose eyes had begun to lose their hard
and inexorable expression, nothwithstanding his harsh
words, from the moment Walter entered the room. It
was so diﬁicult even for a social philosopher to be severe
and stem with that young man. “Yet I am bound to
say, Walter, that it is you who have been most to blame
with respect to that good mother, who only lives but for
her children, and whose very love for them has compelled
her to withdraw herself from beneath this roof. I will not-
now dwell upon your clandestine marriage 5 I leave your-
self to imagine how the want of trust in your best friend
as well as parent evinced in that hasty step must have
wounded her loving heart. Nor do I wish—that is to
say, your mother herself requests me not to bear hardly
upon you with respect to your gambling debts. You
know the full extent of them perhaps—yes, I am afraid
of that—better than she does even yet 5 but she has
paid enough of them already to seriously embarrass her
own aﬂ'airs."
“ I have made a solemn promise never to bet or gamble
more, Dr. Haldane,” said the captain, hoarsely.

i 344 Mirk Abby.
“ I am glad of it, Walter ; but what I was about to say
was, that in this case, as well as in that of your marriage,
it-was not so much the error itself, as the want of frank-
ness evidenced by y0ur concealment of the matter. To
be ashamed of having done wrong, is a proper feeling
enough ; but if it be not accompanied by the acknowledg-
ment of the offence, it only shows one to be a coward,
not a penitent. However, bad as your conduct has been,
in these two particulars, your mother would doubtless
have done her best to forget, as she hastened in both in-
stances to forgive it. But what she could not forget,
since it happened every day and every hour, were the
quarrels between yourself and your brother." Here the
doetor turned sharply round on the young baronet, who
had been hitherto listening, not, perhaps, without com-
placency, to the catalogue of his brother’s misdeeds.—“ I
think, from what I have seen myself, Richard, that it is
yau who are most in fault here. It is no use your looking
proud and cold on me. I never cared three brass
farthings for such airs, though they now and then mis-
became even your poor father, who was worth a dozen of
you. But this ridiculous assumption of superiority—
founded upon mere accident of birth—naturally offends a
high-spirited young man like Walter, who, if he was in
your place, would certainly not make himself odious in
'that way, however he might fail in other matters belong-
ing to your position, which suffers nothing, I readily allow,
in your able hands. That you have the administrative
faculty in a high degree, Sir, I concede; but this is not
Russia, and if it were, you are not the Czar.”
“ No man in Mirk ever called me a tyrant, Dr.
Haldane.”
“Perhaps no man ever dared, Sir; but I dare to say
that a son whose conduct is such that his mother can no
longer bear to witness it, is something worse than a
tyrant. And be sure that if you continue so to behave,
you will never see her face under this roof again."
“ My God, but this is very horrible ! ” cried Sir Richard,

striking his forehead. “ I had no idea—I never dreamed
that matters were coming to any such pass as this.—
Walter—brother, did it seem to you that we were so very
like to Cain and Abel ?"
The two young men embraced, perhaps for the ﬁrst
time in their lives.
“ Oh, when you tell her what you have seen, Sir, do you
think my mother will come back ? ” cried Richard, with
the tears in his ﬁne eyes.
“ I cannot say that; I am sure, however, that she will
be greatly comforted. May I tell her that this is not a
mere impulse of the moment, but that you are resolved
from this time forth to be brothers indeed ?”
“I will do my very best, Walter.”
“And I mine, Richard,” answered the other. “Don’t
reproach yourself like that”—for the vast frame of his
elder brother shook with sobs—“ it is much more my
fault than yours: and you have been very good to me
about my debts; kinder than most fellows in your posi-
tion would have been—yes, you have, Dick; yes, you
have. How very, very long it is since I have called you
Dick; not since we were at school together! You used
to call me Watty, then, you know.”
“Yes, Watty; yes, I had alm0st forgotten it. Let us
go to our mother at once, lad—as we used to do when we
made up our quarrels in the old times—and ask her _to
come back again, and take her place here, Where we all
miss her so much—Where is she, Dr. Haldane ? ”
“I don’t know—that is, I may not tell, my boy,” re-
turned the old gentleman hesitatingly, who, with Letty’s
hand fast clasped in his, was staring out of window as
hard as he could, but his eyes were very dim.
“Have you nothing more to tell us, Sir?” asked Sir
Richard, humbly.
“Well, no, boys. The letter ”
“The letter!” ejaculated Letty; “I remember now
that dear mamma told me herself that when this very
thing should come to pass—although I little knew at the

time to what she was alluding—we should ﬁnd a letter in
her desk.”
“ It is not there now: she put it into my hands, and I
—I tore it up,” observed the d0ct0r. “ I have told you
faithfully all that it contained, with one exception. I do
not choose to speak of that, dear Letty, and I have your
mother’s permission not to do so.”
“Let me speak of it, then,” said Sir Richard, stealing
his arm round his sister’s “mist, and kissing her very
tenderly. “The message the doctor will not give
respects yourself, dear, and his son Arthur. My foolish
pride "
“Pride, indeed I " broke in the little old man impetu-
ously ; “your confounded impertinence, I call it.”
“Very well, doctor,” continued the baronet smiling;
“let it be so, if you will. I had the audacity to suppose,
Letty, that Mr. Arthur Haldane was not good enough for
ou.”
y “ Nor is he,” contested the little doctor with irritation.
“Nobody’s good enough for Letty Lisgard. But he is
as good as can be found in England, that I will say,
though the young man is my own son. And if he does
not make you a pattern husband, I’ll cut him off with a.
shilling."
“ I shall be glad to give you away to such an honest
fellow, Letty,” said the baronet, warmly ; “so let that
matter be considered settled."
It was very pleasant to see the blushing girl hiding her
tearful face in the old man’s arms. “ Oh mamma,
mamma," murmured she, “how happy I should be if you
were but with us 1”
“Well, well, that will be soon, I hope, my dear,” said
the doctor, patting her silken head. “I will do all I can
on my part to persuade her ; I am sure I shall make her
happy with this news.”
“ Yes ; but in the meantime," said Letty, “how terrible
it must be for her to be all alone. If you know where she
is, can you not at least send Forest to be with her P ”

“No, no; but, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to do your
mother’s bidding with respect to that very person. She
expressly desired that until her own return to Mirk,
Mary may be sent to Belcomb, where Madame de
Castellan is just now in saddest need of her.”
“Ay, she writes to me that she has lost her French
maid,” said Sir Richard, picking up the crumpled note:
“in that case, Mary had better go off at once."
“There is worse trouble at Belcomb than that,” re-
marked the doctor gravely. “That poor fellow Derrick,
who, I hear, made so much disturbance at the ﬁts yester-
day, has met with a sad accident.”
“Why, the man was put in the cage quite safe," said
Sir Richard.
“Yes; but unfortunately for himself, he was let out
again, and starting in the dark over Mirkland Hill, whole
drunk, and half mad, the poor wretch wandered into the
mill-yard."
“Through that gap in the wall I” exclaimed the
baronet with excitement. “Didn’t I say the very last
time we went by, that some accident would happen there,
through that man Hathaway's neglect P"
“Well, it has happened now, with a vengeance,"
pursued the doctor, drily. “I was sent for this morning
at two o’clock, to Belcomb, where this poor fellow had
been carried, because it was a better place for him to lie
in than the mill. Hathaway had been working overtime,
it seems; the sails were going till near midnight, and
the story is that this poor fellow strayed beneath them,
and was absolutely taken up and carried round; but, at
all events, he lies there, very ill—dying, I think—with
concussion of the brain, and Heaven knows what beside.
I dare not move him even to examine his ribs.”
“Good God! what can we do for him?" exclaimed
Sir Richard. “ Is there nothing we can send? ”
“He has everything he requires, or that he ever will
have need of, poor fellow, in this world. But old Rachel
is not a good hand at nursing, while Madame de

Castellan, although good-natured enough—for a French-
woman—is quite incapable of such a task; so you
couldn’t do better than send Mary, as Madame has re-
quested, though little knowing how much she would have
need of her: her assistance will be invaluable, and indeed
some sort of help must be had at once. I am going over
there myself immediately, and will take her in my gig, if
you can spare her, Miss Letty, and will tell her to get
ready."
“By all means,” cried Letty, hastily leaving the room
upon that errand.
“ Of course, all notion of prosecuting this poor fellow
is now put out of the question, whatever happens," ob-
served the doctor.
“Quite so—quite so,” answered the baronet, eagerly.
“Poor drunken wretch ; I am sure I’m very sorry. And
I tell you what, Dr. Haldane, if this man dies, there
should be some sort of deodand laid upon that mill.
Hathaway ought to be punished for wilful neglect.”
“ That won’t bring the poor man to life again, though,
observed the doctor.
“N0, of course not; though, if one may be allowed
to say so, he really led such a sad life, by all accounts, it
seems almost as well that he should end it. It would be
a happy release, I mean, if he was to die, poor fellow;
don’t you think so P ”
“Yes, I do. It would be better for himself, and
better for others,” returned the doctor, very gravely.
“ Just so,” said-Sir Richard “better for all concerned,
poor man.” "

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
mum’s APPEAL.
OWEVER Dr. Haldane, at my lady’s own re-
quest, may have misrepresented to the young
folks at the Abbey the motives which had
caused her ﬂight, he told them truth as re-
spected Derrick. That unfortunate man had indeed met
with the frightful mischance described. When he left
Mary Forest on the previous night, his mind confused
with vague revengeful passion, and his brain muddled
with blows, as well as with the spirits he had of late taken
in such quantities, and the eﬁ'ects of which were beginning
to tell upon his exhausted frame, he had staggered up
Mirkland Hill almost like one in a dream. The night
was pitchy dark, and although ever and anon a burst of
light came forth from the ﬁreworks in the Abbey grounds,
they were of course perfectly useless for his guidance.
The top of the hill being quite bare of trees, was less
obscure than the way he had already come, and in any
other circumstances he could scarce have come to harm ;
but as it was, stumbling blindly on with his head low, he
entered the mill-yard through that fatal gap in the wall,
without even knowing he had left the high-road. The
very roaring of the sails, which revolved dangerously near
the ground, might have warned him, but that his ears were
already oceupied with the seething and tumult of his own
brain; and when the terrible thing struck him, before

which he went down upon the instant as the ox falls
before the poleaxe, he never so much as knew from what
he had received his hurt. There he lay for more than an
hour, underneath the whirling sails, which one after
another came round to peer over his haggard face, gashed
with that frightful wound. The lad in charge knew
nothing of what had happened, being engaged in the top
story watching the ﬁreworks in the park beneath ; but
about midnight he stopped the mill, and descending with
his lantern, its rays by chance fell upon Ralph’s prostrate
body. Some persons returning from the festivities at the
Abbey happened to be going by at that very time, and
with their assistance he was carried across the road to the
lodge at Belcomb (there being no sort of accommodation
for one in his condition at the mill), and from thence to
Madame de Castellan’s little cottage.
That lady was for the time, as she had stated in her
letter to Sir Richard, the sole inhabitant of Belcomb ; but
with the injured man, old Rachel and her husband the
gatekeeper of course arrived, and the former did what
she could as sick-nurse until the arrival of Dr. Haldane,
for whom a messenger was at once despatched. The old
Frenchwoman, who was aroused with difﬁculty, and
characteristically kept them waiting at the door while she
made herself ﬁt for the reception of company, was so
shocked and terriﬁed by what had happened, that she was
at ﬁrst of no use at all. She had expressed herself in
broken English as being very glad to be of any service to
the poor sufferer while they were bearing him within, and
had even busied herself in procuring hot water and
bandages; but no sooner did she catch sight of his
ghastly face, seamed with that cruel gash, than all her
resolution appeared to desert her, and she swooned away.
By the time the doctor arrived, however, she had
established herself in the sick-room, and although he had
described her as incapable of doing much in the way of
tendance, she was at least doing her best.
As for Ralph, he lay breathing stertorously, but quite

motionless and unconscious. His mighty chest rose and
fell, but by no means equably ; his large brown hairy
hands lay outstretched before him on the white coverlet ;
his face washed clean indeed from the recent blood-stains,
but with the tangled beard still clotted with gore. It
seemed strange that that powerful English frame of his
should lie there so helplessly, while Madame, with her
show-white hair and delicate fragile hands, was ministering
to him with such patient care ; she that must have been
his senior, one would have thought to look at them, by at
least twenty years. Perhaps it was the sense of this con-
trast which caused the doctor to glance from the one to
the other so earnestly, even before he commenced his ex-
amination of the wounded man.
“Will he live?" asked Madame in English. “ God
knows," added she with trembling accents, “that I have
no other wish within my heart but to hear you say
‘Yes.’" ' r
“ Of course, Madame,” returned the other, with mean-
ing, “ I do not pay you so ill a compliment as to suppose
you to wish m dead, because he inconveniences you by
his presence ere ; but I cannot say ‘Yes’ or ‘ No.’ He
is terribly hurt. The spine is injured; and there are ribs
broken which I cannot even look to now. But it is here "
—-he pointed to the forehead—“where the worst danger
lies: unhappily, the mischief has been done when he was
I —in the worst possible state to hear such a blow in such
a place."
“ Does he know, doctor
“ He knows nothing, Madame; perhaps he may never
know. You must not speak so much, however ,- or, if so,
pray use your native tongue. It is better, if conscious-
ness does return, that the brain should be kept quite
quiet. I think you had better retire to your room,
Madame, and leave myself and Rachel to manage.”
“Yes, yes, we can do very well, lady," assented old
Rachel. “ This is not a place for such as Madame, is it,
Sir? If we could only get Mistress Forest, now; she is

ﬁrst‘rate at nursing ; she nursed me for three whole nights
last winter, when I was most uncommon bad with the
shivers, caught a~coming from Dalwynch in the spring-
cart—and the cover on it, when it don’t rain, is worse
than nothing, for there’s such a draught drives right
through it——”
“Yes, yes,” interrupted the doctor, impatiently; “you
are quite right, Rachel. We’ll send for Mistress Forest
the ﬁrst thing in the morning: she can easily be spared
from the Abbey, now my lady's away."
“ Ah, the more’s the pity ! ” returned old Rachel. “And
this looks almost like a judgment, don’t it, Sir, that this
poor man, who was so rude to my dear mistress—or
wanted to be, as I have heard—should have been carried
in under her own roof here, feet foremost "
“Be silent, woman ! ” broke in Madame de Castellan,
with severity. “We have nothing to do with Lady
Lisgard’s affairs here. This house is my house for the
present ; this wounded man is my guest.”
“Speak French, speak French, Madame,” exclaimed
the doctor, imploringly. “Did you not hear me say so
before P You had much better return to bed.”
“No, no,” returned Madame, in her native tongue;
“I cannot do it. I will be prudent. I will be careful
for the future ; but I cannot leave him, until, at all events,
Mary Forest comes. Oh send her—send her, and let this
woman go, whose presence is intolerable to me."
Accordingly, in his visit to Belcomb about noon next
day, the doctor brought Mistress Forest over with him,
who was at once installed as Ralph Derrick’s sick-nurse ;
old Rachel being sent home to the lodge. No change
had as yet taken place in the sufferer; but the doctor’s
practised eye perceived that one was impending. This
time, he made a long and earnest examination of his
patient.
“Will he live?” asked Madame again, when he had
ﬁnished, with the same earnestness, nay, even anguish as
before.

“There is hope; yes, I think there is hope,” returned
the doctor, cautiously.
“Thank God for that ; I thank Him for His great
mercy ! " ejaculated Madame with clasped hands and up-
turned eyes.
“ Who is that P ” inquired a hoarse voice from the bed.
The words were indistinct, and uttered with diﬁiculty,
but on every ear within that: room they smote with the
most keen signiﬁcance. The two women turned deadly
pale ; and even the doctor’s ﬁnger shook as he placed it
to his lips, in sign they should keep silent.
“ Hush, my good friend,” said he to the wounded man,
whose eyes were now open wide, and staring straight
before him: “you must not talk just now ; speaking is
very bad for you."
“Who is that who was thanking God because there
was hope of my life?" reiterated Ralph. “Neither man
nor woman has any cause to do that, I’m sure ; while
some have cause enough to pray that I were dead already,
or at least had lost my wits. Doctor—for I suppose you
are a doctor—have I lost my wits or not? Am I a sane
man, or one not in my right mind P ”
“Hush, hush; you are sane enough of course, except
to keep on talking thus when I tell you that to speak is
to do yourself the most serious harm."
“You hear him—all you in the room here," continued
the sick man in a voice which, though low and feeble, had
a sort of malignant triumph in it, which grated on the
car. “This doctor says I am quite sane. He says also
that there is hope of my life—just a shadow of a hope.
He is wrong there, for I shall die. But, anyhow, I lie in
peril of death, and yet in my right mind. Therefore,
what I say is to be credited—that, I believe, is the law ;
and even the law is right sometimes. What I am about
to say is truth—every word of it. I wish to make a state-
ment—No, I will take no medicines; pen and ink, if I
could only write, would be more welcome than the Elixir
of Life, but I cannot.” Here a groan was wrung from his

parched and bloodless lips. “Oh, Heaven! the pain I
suffer ; it is the foretaste of the hell for which I am
bound!" ,
“Oh, Sir,” ejaculated Mistress Forest, moving to the
bedfoot, so as to show herself to his staring eyes, “think
of heaven, not of hell. Ask for pardon of God, and not
of revenge upon man."
“Ah, it is you, is it, good wench? I thought that no
one else could have wished me well so piously a while
ago. You did me an ill turn, although you did not mean
to do so, when you let me out of the cage last night.
Was it last night, or a week, or a month ago P "
“It was only last night," interposed the doctor, gravely.
“ Now, do not ask any more questions, or I shall have to
forbid them being answered. It is my duty to tell you
that with every word you speak your life is ebbing
away."
“Then there is the less time to lose,” answered
Derrick, obstinately. “As for answering me, I do not
want that. All I ask of you is, that you shall listen 5 and
what I say, I charge you all, as a dying man, to remember
-—to repeat—to proclaim.” Here he paused from weak~
ness.—“ Doctor,” gasped he, “ a glass of brandy—a large
glass, for I am used to it. I must have it.—Good. I
feel stronger now. Do you think, if you took down my
words in writing, that I could manage "—here a shudder
seemed to shake his poor bruised and broken frame, as
though with the anticipation of torture—“ to set down my
name at the bottom of it P ”
“ N o, my poor fellow—no. You could no more grasp
a pen at present than you could rise and leave this house
upon your feet. You must feel that yourself.”
“I do—I do,” groaned Ralph. “ It is all the more
necessary, then, that you should listen. My real name is
not that one by which I have been known at Mirk. It is
not Derrick, but Gavestone: the same name, good
wench, by which your mistress went before she was
married to Sir Robert Lisgard. But that was not her

maiden name—no, no. Do you not wonder why I tell
you this? or did I speak of it last night, when I was
mad with drink and rage P "
“ You said something of the sort, Sir ; but I knew it all
before that. You are my lady’s husband, and Sir Richard
and the rest are all her bastard children—that is, in the
eye of the law."
“ You knew it, did you?” returned Ralph, after a
pause. “ You were in the plot with her against me, then i’
Iam glad of that. I should be sorry to have left the
world fooled to the last; for I thought that you at least
were an honest wench, although all the world else were
liars. So, after all, you knew it, did you? Well, at all
events, it is news to the doctor here.”
“ No, Sir," returned the old gentleman, quietly apply-
ing some Eau de Cologne and water to the patient’s brow ;
“ I must confess I knew it also.”
“And yet you told nobody !" ejaculated Ralph. “ You
suffered this imposture to go on unexposed ! "
“ I only heard of the facts you speak of—from Lady
Lisgard’s own lips—two days ago at furthest," returned
Dr. Haldane; “and I certainly told nobody, since the
telling could do no good to any human being—not even
to yourself, for instance, and would bring utter ruin and
disgrace ,upon several worthy persons."
“ Ha, ha I " chuckled the patient hoarsely; “you are
right there. Disgrace upon that insolent Sir Richard, and
on that ungrateful puppy, Master Walter."
“True,” continued the doctor, gravely; “ and upon
Miss Letty, who is dear to all who know her, but dearest
to the poor and friendless."
“ I am sorry for her,” said Derrick ; “but I am not sorry
for my lady—she that could look me in the face, and hear
me tell the story of our early love, and of her own supposed
death, to avert which I so gladly risked my life, and all
without a touch of pity.”
“ No, Sir, with much pity,” broke forth Mistress Forest.
“I myself know that her heart bled for you. She never

loved Sir Robert as she did you, ungrateful man! She
loved you dead and alive; she loves you now, although
you pursue her with such cruel hate, and would bring
shame upon all her innocent children.”
“Ay, why not?" answered Ralph. “Have they not
had their day, and is it not my turn at last? Who is the
woman behind the curtains? Let her stand forth, that I
may see her ; she, at least, is not a creature of ‘ my lady,'
like you and the doctor here, and ready, for her sake, to
hide the truth and perpetuate my wrongs. Let that
woman stand forth, I say.”

’ HUS adjured, Madame de Castellan stepped
forward to the same position which Mary
Forest had occupied at the foot of the bed:
nowhere else could Ralph see her, for he was
on his back just as they had ﬁrst laid him, and could not
turn his face a hair-breadth to left or right.
“Who are you?" asked he bluntly. “I do not re-
member having seen your face at Mirk."
“They call me Madame de Castellan,” replied the old
lady in good English, “and I live here at Belcomb by
favour of Sir Richard Lisgard."
“Ah, you have reason, then, to be friends with him
and his,” returned the sick man bitterly. “You will
none of you see me righted. Curse you all ! ”
“I will not see you wronged, if I can help it, Sir,"
replied the Frenchwoman solemnly, but keeping her eyes
ﬁxed always upon the ﬂoor.
“ Will you not? Well, you have an honest face, I
Own; but faces are so deceptive! Mistress Forest’s face

but still she plays rne false. Master Walter’s again—

yet he is base-hearted like the rest; and, lastly, there
was my Lucy—not mine now—no, no ; but what a sweet
look was hers ! And there was guile and Untruth for
you! But that is what I have to tell you. You have
said you will not see me wronged, and I must believe
you, since there is none else to trust to here. Besides,
you are too old to lie; you will be called to your own
account too soon to dare to palter with a dying man.
Yes, I am dying fast—More brandy, doctor—brandy.
Ah, that’s life itself l-And yet, although you are so old,
' Madame, I dare say you remember your youthful days,
when you were fair—for you were fair, I see —and
courted. You were not without your lover, I warrant P ”
“ I was loved, Sir," returned Madame, in low but
steadfast tones.
“And did you marry the man you loved? ”
“I did, Sir. My husband was very dear to me, God
knows, though we did not live long together.”
“ He died young, did he?"
“Alas, yes, and I was left alone in the world without
a friend or a home."
“ His memory did not fade so quickly that you could
love and marry another man at once, I suppose?”
“ His memory never faded," replied the old lady
gravely, “for it has not faded now; but after an interval
of three years, I married another man.”
“And loved him like the other? "
“ No, Sir; there is only one true love—at least for a
woman. But I was a dutiful wife for the second time,-
and there were children born to me—three children—
inexpressibly dear; and when I lost their father, who
loved me, though I could only give him grateful duty in
return, I had something to live for still."
Whether the grief-laden tone of Madame touched him,
or the sad story she was telling, Ralph’s accents seemed
to lose something of their bitterness when he again broke
silence.
“But if, lady, your ﬁrst husband and true lover had,

by some wondrous chance, returned, as it might be, from
the very grave, and you were satisﬁed that it was he in-
deed, and knew him, although he knew you not, and he
was living a bad life among bad company, with no one
in all the world to call him friend, would you not then
have held your arms out to him, and cried: ‘Come
back, come back !’ and told him how you had loved him
all along P” .
“No, Sir; not so. If I had been alone, like him,
with only my own feelings to consult, I might, indeed,
have so behaved; for my heart would have yearned to-
wards him, as it does, Heaven knows, even now. But,
Sir, in such a case there would not only have been love
to be obeyed, but duty. If this man were living the
wild life you speak of, would he not have made a bad
father to my poor children (left in my sole charge and
guardianship by a just and noble man), an evil ruler of a
well-ordered house, a bad example to all whom I would
have had respect him P Nay, worse, would not my ac-
knowledgment of him—which I should otherwise be
eager to make, and willing to take upon myself the
shame that might accrue to me therefrom—would not
that, I say, have brought disgrace on those who had
earned it not—have made my own children, lawfully be-
gotten, as I had thought, all bastards, and soiled the
memory of an honest man, their father? "
A long silence here ensued, broken only by the sick
man’s painful breathing, and the sobs of Mistress Forest,
who strove in vain to restrain her tears.
“I thank you, Madame," said Ralph very feebly:
“you have been pleading without knowing it for one
who—— Do you see these tears? Ldid not think to
ever weep again. Either your gentle voice—reminding
me of the very woman of whom I had meant to speak so
harshly—0r perhaps it is the near approach of death
which numbs these ﬁngers, that would else be clutching
for their revenge—I know not ,- but I now wish no one
harm—Doctor, you must feed this ﬂame once more 5 let

me but speak a very few words, and then I shall have no
more use for life—Mary, good wench, come here. You
will shortly see again that mistress whom you love so
well, and have so honestly served. Tell her Nay,
don’t cry; I do not need your tears to assure me that
you feel for poor Ralph Gavestone—castaway though he
be. I heard your ‘Thank God’ when the doctor said
(though he was wrong there) that there was hope for me.
Those were very honest words, Mary."
“ I did not say them ! " ejaculated the waiting-maid
earnestly. “Oh Madame, tell him who it was that said
them.”
“It was 1," murmured Madame de Castellan, coming
close'to the bedside, and kneeling down there.
“ You, lady! Why should you pray so earnestly that
I might live, whose death w'ould proﬁt many, but whose
recovery none P "
“ Because I have wronged you, Ralph. Yes, Ralp/z /
You know me now. Do not ask to see my patched and
painted face again, because it is not mine, but listen to my
voice, which you remember. I am your own wife, Lucy,
and I love you, husband mine.”
“ She loves me still," murmured the dying man : “she
owns herself my wife, thank God, thank God l" The
tears rolled down his cheeks, and over his rough and
ghastly face a mellow softness stole, like the last gleam of
sunset upon a rocky hill. Dr. Haldane rose and noise-
lessly left the room, beckoning Mary to follow. The
dying husband and his wife were left to hold their last
interview alone.
“ What I have been telling you, Ralph, as the history
of another, is my own. I have never forgotten you.
I have loved you all along. Forgive me, if I seem to
have sacriﬁced you to—to those it was my duty to shield
from shame. I could not bear to see disgrace fall upon
my children, and so I ﬂed from them, in hopes to save
them from it. And yet I loved them so that I could
not altogether leave them, but took this cottage in another

Oh lover, husband, who saved my life at peril of his own,
a mother’s heart was my excuse—be generous and noble
as of old—forgive me ! "
“Forgive you!" gasped the sick man: “nay, forgive
me/ How could I ever have sought to do you wrong !
My own dear Lucy!” In an instant she had'plucked
away so much of her disguise as was about her face and
head, and was leaning over him with loving eyes.
“ How many years ago, wife, is it since you kissed me
last?" murmured the dying man. “My outward sight
is growing very dim ; I do not recognise my Lucy's face,
although I know ’tis she; but I see her quite clearly
sitting in the cottage-porch beside the shining river.
How it roars among the rounded stones, and how swiftly
it is running to the sea! Round my neck, love, you will
presently ﬁnd the little locket with that dead sprig of
fuchsia in it which you gave me when we plighted troth.
Let that be buried with me ; I have had no love or care
for sacred things, but perhaps They say that God

good, Lucy. Ah me ! I wonder, in the world to come,

A piercing cry broke from my lady’s lips. “ Spare me,

certain, I am dying now— fast, fast. Thank God for

that! It would have been a woeful thing, having thus
found my own, to have left her straightway, and taken
my lone way through the world again, knowing the thing
I know. But I would have done it, never fear. Are
you sure of those two, Lucy—that were here a while ago
—quite sure? My dying curse upon them, if they breathe
to human ear our sacred secret ! They love you? That
is well. I would have all the world to love you 5 and
may all those you love repay that priceless gift with
tender duty." Here he paused, as if to gather together
his little remaining strength ; and when he spoke again,
it was with a voice so low that my lady had to place her
ear quite close to his pale lips to catch his words. But
she did hear them, everyone. “The prayers of a man
like me may avail nothing, Lucy, but at least they can do
~no harm. God bless Sir Richard—yes, yes ! God bless
Master Walter’s handsome face! God bless Miss Letty!
That’s what I said on Christmas-eve with Steve and the
rest of them, not knowing whom I spoke of, and I say it
now, for are they not my Lucy’s dear ones? God bless
you, my dear wife. Kiss—kiss.”
T hose were the last words of wild Ralph Gavestone.
When the doctor and Mistress Forest re-entered that
silent room, my lady was upon her knees beside the
pillow; she had closed the dead man’s eyes, and folded
his palms together, and taken from his neck the locket,
but to be returned to him by a trusty hand when the
time came.

CHAPTER XL.
AND LAST
F there had happened to be anyone upon whom
‘ poor Ralph’s wild talk, on the night of the
Abbey festivities, had made any serious im-
pression whatever, it was destined to be re
moved by the inquest that followed upon his death. The
very words he had made use of in his fury, his calling my
lady his wife, and stigmatising Sir Richard as her natural
son, would have been held to be no slight evidence of
his insanity, which, however, was abundantly proved by
other testimony. The waiter at the Royal Marine at
Coveton came in all good faith to take his solemn oath
that, to the best of his judgment, the gent. with the
beard, who had scandalised that respectable house by
taking brandy for breakfast, was like no other man alive
as he had ever served; or, in other words, was nothing
short of a lunatic. The postboys whom he had com-
manded to stop and let him out before his chaise could
be whirled over the ﬁrst stage, pronounced him mad.
The porter at the railway station, to whose, civil inquiry
as to whither he was going the angry man had returned
so uncivil an answer, came to the same conclusion. No
man nearer home, from the lord-lieutenant to the parish
constable, and (even of his whilom companions) from
Captain Walter Lisgard to landlord Steve, but gave it as
his opinion that the man was mad. And the verdict of

the coroner’s jury being in accordance with the evidence,
decided that the deceased had met with his death in the
manner with which we are acquainted during an attack
of temporary insanity, induced by drink.
The nerves of Madame de Castellan had received
much too great a shock, from recent occurrences, to
permit her presence at the inquest; and, indeed, such an
effect did -they take upon her, that she left not only
Belcomb but England itself almost immediately, declin-
ing with many thanks Sir Richard’s offer—notwithstand-
ing that Letty drove over in person to make it known to
her—that she should take‘up her residence for the pre-
sent at the Abbey itself. So Madame went back again
to her native land as suddenly and almost as mysteriously
as she had come; and after a while, wrote to inform her
English friends that the domestic disagreements which
had driven her from home were in a fair way to be healed,
and that it was very unlikely that she should have to
trespass upon their kindness any more.
The real history of that lady’s coming to Belcomb was
never absolutely known to more than two persons, and
perhaps more or less rightly guessed at by a third. From
the moment that my lady recognised her ﬁrst husband in
Ralph Derrick, she never concealed from herself the
possibility of her having to leave the Abbey, and become
perhaps alifelong exile from home 'and friends for her
three children’s sakes, but especially for that of Sir
Richard. Perhaps she exaggerated the depth to which
family pride had taken root in the heart of her eldest
son; but she honestly believed that the knowledge of
his being illegitimate would have killed him. Although
she could never have possessed the strength of mind,
even had she enjoyed the requisite want of principle,
to deny in person Ralph’s claim to her as her lawful
husband, she justly argued that he would be utterly
unable to establish his case in her absence. He could
summons no witness whose testimony would go half
so far as her own tell-tale face; while his own character

And Last. 365
was such, that no credence would be given to his state-
ment, unless supported by strong and direct evidence.
Thus situated, my lady turned over in her mind scheme
after scheme of ﬂight, without hitting upon anything
that gave much promise, and all of which entailed a
residence abroad, cruelly far from those dear ones from
whom she was about, with such a heavy heart, to ﬂee
for their own good; but when she had, perforce, as we
have seen, to take Mistress Forest into her conﬁdence,
something arose out of a conversation between them
concerning their old life together at Dijon, which sug-
gested that ingenious artiﬁce which she eventually put
into elfect. Madame de Castellan had been dead some
years, though of that circumstance my lady’s children
were unaware, albeit Sir Richard had heard a good
deal of her when a. boy, and had even some dim re-
collection of her personal appearance when she was a
guest of his father and mother at the Abbey.
Of this remembrance, my lady took advantage. Mary
and herself in that old school-time at Dijon had been
used to act charades at Madame’s house, and that cir-
cumstance no doubt put into Lady Lisgard’s mind the
idea of personating the old Frenchwoman herself. My
lady had learned from those amateur performances the
secrets of “green-room" metamorphosis ;" she was
naturally endowed with no small power of mimicry;
and she could speak French like a native. Supposing
that the desired transformation could be effected, what
securer plan, and one more unlikely to be suspected,
could be found than that secluded cottage of Belcomb,
so time to the Abbey, and whither all news relating to
her children could be brought to her at once through
Mary, who, it was arranged, should be transferred to
Madame's service in the manner that was afterwards
actually adopted. The letter purporting to come from
Dijon and taken by Sir Richard‘s own hand from the post-

366 Mrk Abbey.
bag, had been placed therein by Mary Forest, who had
used her mistress's key at an earlier 'hour, and found that
communication from Arthur Haldane concerning Ralph’s
departure for Coveton, which necessitated such imme-
diate action on the part of my lady. There was not
one day to be lost in making her preparations, and
indeed from that time she had been ready to start at a
moment’s notice, though, as it happened, there was no
need for such urgent haste. The counterfeit visit in
person to the Abbey was of course running a consider-
able risk, but the establishment of the fact of Madame
de Castellan’s arrival at Belcomb, my lady had rightly
judged to be of paramount importance; indeed, that
being eﬁ‘ected, it is doubtful, even if the unhappy Ralph
had not met with so sudden an end, whether any
suspicion of Madame and my lady being one and the
same person would have ever existed. The most difﬁ-
cult matter connected with my lady’s ﬂight was in truth,
after all, to ﬁnd a reason for it sutlicient to satisfy the
minds of those she left behind her. The children would
have been slow to believe that she could bring herself to
leave home and them, simply because her two boys did
not get on well together, for in that case, absentee
mothers should be considerably more common than
they are. But, fortunately, not only did the ﬂame of dis-
cord between Sir Richard and Master Walter continue
to burn, but received plenty of unexpected fuel, such
as at any other time would have caused my lady unutter-
able woe, but which, under present circumstances, were
almost welcome to her. Walter’s clandestine marriage
with the very girl to whom his brother had offered his
own hand, was an incident so painful as to give my lady
excuse for almost anything; but Walter had left the
Abbey, and it was important that he should return
thither and make things unpleasant, as he could not fail
to do by the mere fact of his presence there with Rose.
Sir Richard, with his file in view, was easily persuaded
to ask the new-married couple down, and all things

And Last. 361
worked together for ill, which for once was my lady’s
“good.” -
Then, again, Walter’s debts—of the full extent of
which, however, his mother was never informed—gave
her an additional cause of serious dissatisfaction; and
lastly, Sir Richard’s opposition to Letty’s marriage with
Arthur Haldane, made up a very respectable bill of
indictment. ' At all events, as we have seen, it was
acknowledged so to be by the parties against whom it‘
had been ﬁled. The consciences of both Sir Richard
and Walter were really pricked; and, besides, there was
the painful fact of their mother's departure from her
own roof, owing to their conduct, whether it justiﬁed
such an extreme measure upon her part or not. More-
over, the delegate to whom my lady had committed the
disclosure of her motives, had been well chosen. It was
necessary that a third person should be admitted to the
knowledge of my lady's secret, in order that her affairs
might be transacted during an absence which might be
prolonged for years, or even for a lifetime; and where
could she ﬁnd so tried and trustworthy a friend as Dr.
Haldane? The fact, too, of his visiting the Abbey in
person, after an interval of so many years, and even after
his so recent refusal to be present on the all-important
occasion of Sir Richard's coming of age, gave additional
weight to the mission upon which he came. It brought
about, as has been shown, a genuine reconciliation
between the brothers, and even exacted from them a
solemn promise that their disagreements should hence-
forth cease. Nor was it destined that the good doctor’s
friendly offices should cease with this. When the day
came to lay Ralph Derrick’s body in its cofﬁn, the old
philosopher—nay, cynic, as many held him to be_-
placed very reverently with his own hands that little
locket around the dead man’s neck, which he had
treasured as the most precious thing he owned for more
than half a lifetime. And on the morrow, when they
buried him in Dalwynch churchyard, the doctor followed

him to the grave, not only as the “deceased’s medical
attendant,” but as his chief and only mourner, with a
tender pity for the world-battered and passionful man,
who had thus found rest at last. He stood beside the
round black mound, when all had departed, with that
wise, sad smile upon his face, which he always wore when
he was thinking deepest, and though “Poor fellow, poor
fellow l" was all he said, it was a more pregnant epitaph
than is often to be read on tombstones.
After a little, the good news came to Mirk from
France, that my lady, trusting to what she had heard
from her old friend, was coming home again. The only
stipulation she made was, that her withdrawal from the
Abbey was not to be alluded to by any of her family,
for which, indeed, added she, there would be less
necessity, since the principal cause of it—theill-feeling
between her sons—n0 longer, as she was delighted to
understand, existed. Of course, Lady Lisgard could
not prevent “the county ” from canvassing the matter,
any 'more than she could have forbidden a general
election ; and, in truth, her affairs were almost as much
talked about as politics after a dissolution of parlia-
ment. She and her sons had each their partisans, who
argued for their respective clients often with great
enthusiasm, and sometimes with an ingenuity worthy
of better premises. But it was the general opinion that
Master Walter’s marriage was at the bottom of the
whole business, and that that designing woman, Rose
Aynton, had sown dissension in what had once been
one of the best-conducted and most united families in
Wheatshire.
An account of the inquest in the local journals, 3.
paragraph in the ﬁrms, headed “ Curious Catastrophe,”
and an allusion to Don Quixote’s adventure apropos of
the homicidal windmill, in a comic print, exhausted the
subject of Ralph Derrick’s death.
But my lady returned to Mirk Abbey in deep moum-
ing, it was understood in consequence of the sudden

death of Madame de Castellan, which occurred, singu-
larly enough, almost immediately after her leaving
Belcomb.
It was thought very unfortunate that the two old
friends should thus have never been permitted to meet.
Madame’s demise, however, of course left Mary Forest
free to rejoin her former mistress, in whose company,
indeed, she returned to Mirk.
We have said that besides the two persons in posses-
sion of my lady’s secret, there was a third who had
his shrewd suspicions. But if Arthur Haldane’s legal
training had really enabled him to come to the right
conclusion in the matter, it also judiciously restrained
him from saying anything about it.
He had never cause to use that memorandum which
we saw him set down in his pocket-book of Miss Letty’s
opinion. “ It seems to me that pebple should be taken
for what they are, let their birth be what it will; ” but
we believe that it was not without a reason that he com-
mitted it to paper. Although entirely yithout ancestral
pride, and with a very hearty contempt for any such
folly, as matters stood, Letty was just the sort of girl
who, upon ﬁnding herself illegitimate, would have re-
fused to carry out her engagement, from the apprehen-
sion of attaching disgrace to the man she loved; and
therefore Arthur thought it well to record her own
argument against herself, in case any such occasion
should arise. Not many months elapsed, however, be-
fore this possible obstruction was removed, in the
pleasantest manner, by the union of these two young
people : and a happier or better assorted couple it is not
my forttme to know.
Sir Richard remains a bachelor, although as staid and
decorous in his conduct as any married man ; even more
so than some, it is whispered—but then, who can
seriously blame charming Master Walter? The cause
of the young baronet’s celibacy is strenuously held by
many to be Miss Rose Aynton's rejection of him long

ago, for that has oozed out, somehow or other, divulged
perhaps by the young woman herself in some moment
when her vanity for once overcame her prudence; but at
all events, Sir Richard has acted very generously to-
wards his brother‘s wife (that’s how these gossips put it),
and her husband Captain Lisgard’s debts have been
settled, and he has been entirely “setup” with respect
to his pecuniary affairs; and, moreover, he runs no risk
of being again embarrassed. If it is really true that he
occasionally forgets that abrupt ceremony which took
place between himself and Rose at the register oﬁice
(and somehow the thing does not recur to the memory
with such force under those circumstances as when one
is married in the usual way by the combined endeavours
of several clergymen), and indulges in little ﬂirtatious, he
has at least forsworn both the turf and the gaming-table.
We do not say that he is given up entirely to his military
duties, but he is in the enjoyment of an excellent staff
appointment, and possesses the fullest conﬁdence both
of his commanding ofﬁcer and of that functionary’s wife ;
which latter, we all know, is essential to the position of
an aide-decamp. But the fact is, that almost everybody
likes Master Walter, and will continue to do so (although
perhaps somewhat less as he grows older) to his dying day.
And why not? {
Dieu l’a jugé. Silence, sings a true poet upon the
death of the ﬁrst Napoleon: Que der faib/er world: [a

GENIE u’ssr PAS UNE DE vos VERTUS? And what has
thus been greatly written of genius, may also surely be
said in a less sense of what we call (for lack of a better
word) manner. England has lately followed to his grave
with weeping eyes, a statesman—both honest, indeed,
and able—but whose chief claim to her affection rested
upon this comparatively humble gift, so precious because
so rare. When combined with youth and personal graces,
as in Walter Lisgard’s case, it is well-nigh irresistible,

and has always been so from the days of Plato and
Xenophon. Too often worthless in themselves, or ren-
dered so by being “spoilt” by all who meet them ; not
seldom empty-headed, or with heads turned by conceit
and ﬂattery; and almost always destitute of reverence
for sacred things, whether divine or human—natural 0r
doctrinal—we yet prefer the company of those thus
dowered to that of the‘ wise, the witty, or the good. Their
smile is a pleasure; their very presence is a harmony;
and prayerless themselves, they evoke the supplications
of the pure in their behalf.
Even Rose herself continues to be to some extent
infatuated with Master Walter—although he is her own
husband—a feat surely far more difﬁcult of accomplish-
ment than for the valet de rlzambre of a hero to believe
in his master’s reputation. At all events, it is beyond
question that she grows very jealous of the captain.
Master Walter has never been jealous of lzer; not, in-
deed, that he has had any serious reason to be so, but
because such a baleful sentiment is never allowed to
enter his well contented mind. He is thoroughly per-
suaded that if his wife loves anybody else in the world
beside herself—that that person is her husband ,- and he
is right. He, too, has a genuine affection for one other
individual beside Captain Walter Lisgard ; and this is for
his mother. We all know that she returns it seventyfold.
My lady lives a tranquil and not unhappylife in her old
home with dutiful Sir Richard, very pleasantly diversiﬁed
by frequent visits from dear Letty and her husband—their
last advent being a particularly grateful one, since they
brought with them a little stranger, aged six weeks,
whom it was always a matter of diﬁiculty to extricate
from grandmamma’s loving arms. But my lady’s whitest
days are those rare ones which her darling Walter ﬁnds
it possible—so pressing are his military duties—to spend
at somewhat sombre Mirk. Then she is happy; then
she is almost her old self as we ﬁrst knew her, before
those deep tones, speaking from the grave, upon Mirk

Abbey lawn at Christmas-time, broke in upon her calm
harmonious days. Master Walter has no child. This
troubles her sometimes; but at others she feels very
thankful for it; for if he had a son, or should Sir Richard
marry and beget one, would not a certain, however
venial, imposition be perpetuated in the descent of the
title P Even now, when no great harm seems done, my
lady’s‘conscience is not altogether at ease ; nay, once, so
disturbed it grew, that she took secret counsel on the
matter with Dr. Haldane.
“Dear lady,” said he, “if any human being could be
bettered by the disclosure you hint at, or any human
being was wronged by your reticence, I should be the
ﬁrst to say: “Tell all ,' ” but as things stand, it would, in
my opinion, not only be Quixotic, but downwright mad-
ness to disentomb that woeful secret, which lies buried
in Ralph Gavestone’s grave. Moreover, I understood it
was his dying wish that his story should remain untold."
This last observation, delivered with great simplicity,
was the best remedy for my lady’s troubled mind that
the good doctor could have prescribed. But when this
moral patient of .his had left his consulting-room quite
cured, the radical philosopher permitted himself a con-
gratulatory- chuckle. “ Gad,” said he (he used the inter-
jections of half a century ago), “it is lucky my lady
questioned me no further. .My difﬁculty lies in permit-
ting aperson of title more than there need be in this
misgoverned country. If the Lisgards had a peerage in
their family, I should think it my duty to explode the
whole concern. But I don’t suppose one baronet more
than there is any necessity to suffer, can do mar/'1 /ICZI'i/l."
So Sir Richard Lisgard, little dreaming upon how un-
satisfactoryatenure it is held, keeps his title unmolested ;
and “ my lady " (Heaven bless her i) is still the honoured
mistress of Mink ABBEY.

“ ‘ Milly's Hero’ is an interesting story, exceedingly well told. The book is full
of Charming touches of real life, done by one who has been able largely to notice
and to comprehend the diﬁ'ering characters and idiosyncracies of individuals.
Special pains have been bestowed upon the heroine of the story. The plot of the
