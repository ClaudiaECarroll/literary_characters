5: CHAPTER THE FIRST.*
)~ THE FLOOD.
HEN Pliny lost his life, and Herculaneum was buried,
Manchester was born. Whilst lava and ashes blotted
from sight and memory fair and luxurious Roman cities close
[\to the Capitol, the Roman soldiery of Titus, under their generalv
\Agricola, laid the foundations of a distant city which now com-
‘~\epetes with the great cities of the world. Where now rise
_ forests of tall chimneys, and the hum of whirling spindles,
‘Lspread the dense woods of Arden; and from the clearing in
cheir midst rose the Roman castrum of Mamutiumq‘ which has
{left its name of Castle Field as a memorial to us. But where
jtheir summer camp is said to have been pitched, on the airy
irock at the conﬂuence of the rivers Irk and Irwell, sacred
church and peaceful college have stood for centuries, and only
‘antiquaries'can point to Roman possession, or even to the
Qbaronial hall which the Saxon lord perched there for security.
{ And only an antiquary or a very old inhabitant can recall
“ anchester as it was at the close of the last century, and
Qshutting his eyes upon railway-arch, station, and esplanade,
Qupon Palatine buildings, broad roadways, and river embank-
ments, can see the Irk and the Irwell as they were when the
:Cathedral was the Collegiate Church, with a diminutive brick
C‘wall round its ancient graveyard. Then the irregular-fronted
ijrows of quaint old houses which still, under the name of Half
qéStreet, crowd upon two sides of the churchyard, with only an

intervening strip of a ﬂagged walk between, closed it up on
a third side, and shut the river (lying low beneath) from the
view, with a huddled mass of still older dwellings, some of
which were thrust out of sight, and were only to be reached by
ﬂights of break-neck steps of rock or stone, and like their hoary
fellows creeping down the narrow roadway of Hunt’s Bank,
overhung the Irwell, and threatened to topple into it some day.
The Chetham Hospital or College still looks solidly down
on the Irk at the angle of the streams; the old Grammar
School has been suffered to do the same ; and—thanks to the
honest workmen who built for our ancestors—the long lines of
houses known as Long Millgate are for the most part standing,
and on the river side have resisted the frequent ﬂoods of cen-
turies.
In 1799 that line was almost unbroken, from the College
(where it commenced at Hunt’s Bank Bridge) to Red Bank.
The little alley by the Town Mill, called Mill-brow, which led
down to the wooden Mill Bridge, was little more of a gap than
those narrow entries or passages which pierced the walls like
slits here and there, and offered dark and perilous passage to
courts and alleys, trending in steep incline to the very bed of
the Irk. The houses themselves had been good originally,
and were thus cramped together for defence in perilous times,
when experience taught that a narrow) gorge was easier held
against warlike odds than an open roadway.
Ducie Bridge had then no existence, but Tanners’ Bridge—
no doubt a strong wooden structure like that at Mill-brow—
accessible from the street only by one of those narrow steep
passages, stood within a few yards of its site, and had a place
on old maps so far back as 16 50. Its name is expressive, and
goes to prove that the tannery on the steep banks of the Irk,
behind the houses of Long Millgate opposite to the end of
Miller’s Lane, was a tannery at least a century and a half
before old Simon Clegg worked amongst the tan-pits, and
called William Clough master. I '
To this sinuous and picturesque line of houses, the streams
with their rocky and precipitous banks will have served in
olden times as a natural defensive moat (indeed it is noticeable
that old Manchester kept pretty much within the angle of its
rivers), and in 1799, from one end of Millgate to the other, the
dwellers by the waterside looked across the stream on green
and undulating uplands, intersected by luxuriant hedgerows, a
bleachery at Walker’s Croft, and a short terrace of houses near

Scotland Bridge, denominated Scotland, being the sole breaks
in the verdure.
Between the tannery and Scotland Bridge, the river makes a
sharp bend ; and here, at the elbow, another mill, with its cor-
responding dam, was situated. The current of the Irk, if not
deep, is strong at all times, though kept by its high banks
within narrow compass. But when, as is not unseldom the
case, there is a sudden ﬂushing of water from the hill-country,
it rises, rises, rises, stealthily, though swiftly, till the stream
overtops its banks, washes over low-lying bleach-crofts, ﬁelds,
and gardens, mounts foot by foot over the fertile slopes, invades
the houses, and, like a mountain-robber sweeping from his
fastness on a peaceful vale, carries his spoil with him, and
leaves desolation and wailing behind. '
Such a ﬂood as this, following a heavy thunder-storm, deF
vastated the valley of the Irk, on the 17th of August, 1799.
Well was it then for the tannery and those houses on the
bank of the Irk which had their foundations in the solid 'rock,
for the waters surged and roared at their base and over plea- ,
sant meadows—a wide-spread turbulent sea, with here and
there- an island of refuge, which the day before had been a
lofty mound.
The ﬂood of the previous Autumn, when a coach and horses
had been swept down the Irwe11,-.and men and women were
drowned, was [as nothing to this. The tannery yard, high as
it was above the bed of the Irk, and solid as was its an
bankment, was threatened with invasion. The surging water
roared and beat against its masonry, and licked its coping with
frothy tongue and. lip, like a hungry giant, greedy for fresh
food. Men with thick clogs and hide-bound legs, leathern
gloves and aprons, were hurrying to and fro with barrows and
bark-boxes for the reception of the valuable hides which their
mates, armed with long-shafted hooks and tongs, were drag- .
ging from the pits pell-mell, ere the advancing waters should v
encroach upon their territory, and empty the tan-pits for them.
Already the insatiate ﬂood bore testimony to its ruthless
greed. Hanks of yarn, pieces of calico, hay, uptorn bushes,
planks, chairs, boxes, dog-kennels, and hen-coops, a shattered _
chest of drawers, pots and pans, had swept past, swirling and _
eddying in the ﬂood, which by this time spread like a vast lake
over the opposite lands, and had risen within three feet of the
arch of Scotland Bridge, and hardly left a trace where the mill-
dam chafed it commonly.

g: T/ze Mam/lash)? Man.
Too busy were the tanners, under the eye of their master, to
stretch out hand or hook to arrest the progress of either fumi-
ture or live stock, though bee~hives and hen-coops, and more
than one squealing pig, went racing with the current, now rising
towards the footway of Tanner’s Bridge.
Every window of every house upon the banks was crowded
with anxious heads, for ﬂooded Scotland rose like an island
from the watery waste, and their own cellars were fast ﬁlling.
There had been voices calling to each other from window to
window all the morning; but now from window to window,
from house to house, rang one reduplicated shriek, which
caused many of the busy tanners to quit their work, and rush
to the water’s edge. To their horror, a painted wooden cradle,
which had crossed the deeply-submerged dam in safety, was
ﬂoating foot-foremost down to destruction, with an infant
calmly sleeping in its bed ; the very motion of the waters
having seemingly lulled it to sounder repose !
“ Good Lord ! It’s a choilt 3” exclaimed Simon Clegg, the
eldest tanner in the yard. “Lend a hand here, fur the sake 0’
th’ childer at whoam.”
Half a dozen hooks and plungers were outstretched, even
while he spoke; but the longest was lamentably too short to
arrest the approaching cradle in its course, and the unconscious
babe seemed doomed. With frantic haste Simon Clegg rushed
on to Tanner’s Bridge, followed by a boy; and there, with
book and plunger, they met the cradle as it drifted towards
them, afraid of over-balancing it even in their attempt to save.
It swerved, and almost upset; but Simon dexterously caught
his hook within the wooden hood, and drew the frail bark and
its living freight close to the bridge. The boy, and a man
named Cooper, lying ﬂat on the bridge, then clutched at it
with extended hands, raised it carefully from the turbid water,
and drew it safely between the open rails to the footway, amidst
the shouts and hurrahs of breathless and excited spectators.
The babe was screaming terribly. The shock when the
ﬁrst hook stopped the progress of the cradle had disturbed its
dreams, and its little fat arms were stretched out piteously as
strange faces looked down upon it instead of the mother’s
familiar countenance. Wrapping the patchwork quilt around
it, to keep it from contact with his wet sleeves and apron,
Simon, tenderly as a woman, lifted the infant in his rough
arms, and strove to comfort it, but in vain. His beard of
three days growth was as a rasp to its soft skin, and the closer

he carressed, the more it screamed. The men from the tan-
nery came crowding round him. .
“What dost ta mean to do wi’ th’ babby?” asked the man
Cooper of old Simon. “ Aw’d tak’ it whoam to my missis, but
th’ owd lass is nowt to be takken to, an’ wur cross as two sticks
when 0i only axed fur mi baggin to bring to wark wi’ mi this
mornin’,” added he, with rueful remembrance of the scolding
wife on his hearth.
“Neay, lad, aw’ll not trust th’ poor choilt to thy Sally. It
’ud be loike chuckin’ it out 0’ th’ wayter into th’ ﬁre (Hush-a-by,
babby). Aw’ll just take it to ar’ Bess, and hoo’ll cuddle it up,
and gi’ it summat to sup, till we ﬁnd its own mammy,” answered
Simon, leaving the bridge. “. Bring the kayther" alung, Jack,”
(to the boy) “Bess’ll want it. We’n noan 0’ that tackle at ar
place. Hush-a-by, hush-a-by, babby.”
But the little thing, missing its natural protector, and half'
stiﬂed in the swathing quilt, only screamed the louder; and
Simon, notwithstanding his kind heart, was truly glad when
his daughter Bess, who had witnessed the rescue from their
own window, met him at the tannery gate, and relieved him of
his struggling charge. ‘
“Si thi, Bess ! here’s a God-send fur thi—a poor little babby
fur thi to tend an’ be koind to, till them it belungs to come
a-seekin’ fur it,” said he to the young woman ; “but thah mun
give it summat better than cowd wayter—it’s had too mich 0’
that a’ready.”
“That aw will, poor darlin’ l” responded she, kissing the
babe’s velvet cheeks as, sensible of a. change of nurses, it
nestled to her breast. “Eh! but there’ll be sore hearts for
this blessed babby, somewheere.” And she turned up the
narrow passage which led at once from the tan-yard and the-
bridge, stilling and soothing the little castaway as adroitly as an
experienced nurse.
“ Now, luk thi, lad,” Simon remarked to Cooper; “is na it
fair wonderful heaw that babby taks to at Bess P But it’s just
a way hoo has, an’ theere is na a fractious choilt i’ a’ ar yard
but’ll be quiet wi’ Bess.”
Cooper looked after her, nodded an assent, and sighed, as-
if he wished some one in another yard had the same soothing
way with her.
But the voice of the raging water had not stilled like that of
the rescued infant. Back went the two men to their task, and

worked away with a will to carry hides, bark and implements to
places of security. And as they hurried to and fro with loads
on back or barrow, up, up, inch by inch, foot by foot, the swell-
ing ﬂood rose still higher, till, lapping the foot-bridge, curling
over the embankment, it drove the sturdy tanners back, flung
itself into the pits, and, in many a swirling eddy, washed tan
and hair and skins into the common current.
Not so much, however, went into its seething caldron as
might have been, had the men worked with less vigour ; and,
quick to recognise the value of ready service, Mr. Clough led
his drenched and weary workmen to the “ Skinner’s Arms,” in
Long Millgate, and ordered a supply of ale and bread and
cheese to be served out to them.
At the door of the public—house, where he left the workmen
to the enjoyment of this impromptu feast, he encountered
Simon Clegg. The kind fellow had taken a hasty run to his
owntenement, “just to see heaw ar Bess an’ th’ babby get on,”
and he brought back the intelligence that it was “a lad, an’ as
good as goold.”
“ Oh, my man, I’ve been too much occupied to speak to you
before,” cried Mr. Clough. “ I saw you foremost in the
rescue of that unfortunate infant, and shall not forget it. Here
is a crown for your share in the good deed. I suppose that
was the child’s mother you gave it to? ” .
Simon was a little man, but he drew back with considerable
native dignity. - ,
“ Thenk yo’, measter, all th’ same, but aw connot tak’ brass
fur just 'doin’ my duty. Aw’d never ha slept i’ my bed gin that
little un had bin dreawned, an’ me lookin’ on loike a stump.
Neay; that lass wur Bess, moi wench. We’n no notion wheer
th’ lad’s mother is.”
Mr. Clough would have pressed the money upon him, but
he put it back with a motion of his hand.
“No, sir; aw’m a poor mon, a varry poor mon, but aw .
connot tak’ money fur savin’ a choilt’s life. It’s agen’ mi
conscience. I’ll tak’ mi share 0’ the bread an’ cheese, an’ drink
yo’r health i’ a sup 0’ ale, but aw cudna’ tak’ that brass if aw
wur deein’.”
And Simon, giving a scrape with his clog, and a duck of his
head, meant for a bow, passed his master respectfully, and
went clattering up the steps of the “ Skinners’ Arms,” leaving
the gentleman standing there, and looking after him in mingled
astonishment and admiration.

CHAPTER THE SECOND.
NO ONE KNOWS.
HEN the scurrying waterpthick with sand and mud,
and discoloured with dye stuffs, which ﬂoated in
brightly-tinted patches on its surface, ﬁlled the arch of Scot-
land Bridge, and left only the rails of Tanners’ Bridge visible,
the inundation reached its climax; but a couple of ,days
elapsed before the ﬂood subsided below the level of the un-
protected tannery-yard, and until then neither Simon Clegg
nor his mates could resnme their occupations. Q
There was a good deal of lounging about Long Millgate an
the doors of the “Queen Anne ” and “ Skinners’ Arms,” of
heavily-shod men, in rough gamiture of thick hide—armoury
against the tan and water in which their daily bread was
steeped.
But in all those two days no anxious father, no white-faced
mother, had‘run from street to street, and house to house, to
seek and claim,a rescued living child. No, not even when
the week had passed, though the story of his “ miraculous pre-
servation” was the theme of conversation at the tea-tables of
gentility and in the bar-parlours of taverns ;- was the gossip of
courts and alleys, highways and byways ; and though echo, in
the guise of a “ﬂying stationer,” caught it up and spread it
broadcast in catchpenny sheets, far beyond the conﬁnes of the
inundation.
This was the more surprising as no dead bodies had been
washed down the river, and no lives were reported “lost.”
Had the child no one to care for it P—no relative to whom its
little life was precious? Had it been abandoned to its fate, a
waif unloved, uncared for?
The house in which Simon Clegg lived was situated at the
very end of Skinners’ Yard, a :ul-de-sae, to which the only ap-
proach was a dark covered entry, not four feet wide. The

pavement of the yard was natural rock, originally hewn into
broad ﬂat steps, but then worn with water from the skies, and
from house-wifer pails, and the tramp of countless clogs, to a
rugged steep incline, asking wary stepping from the stranger
on exploration after nightfall. Gas was, of course, unknown,
but not even an oil-lamp lit up the gloom.
In the sunken basement a tripe-boiler had a number of stone
troughs or cisterns, for keeping his commodities cool for sale.
The three rooms of Simon Clegg were situated immediately
above these, two small bed-rooms overlooking the river and
pleasant green ﬁelds beyond ; the wide kitchen window having
no broader range of prospect than the dreary and not too
savoury yard. Even this view was shut out by a batting frame,
resembling much a long, narrow French bedstead, all the
more that on it was laid a thick bed of raw (that is, undressed)
cotton, freckled with seeds and ﬁne bits of husky pod. Bess
was a batter, and her business was to turn and beat the clotted
mass with stout lithe arms and willow-wands, until the ﬁbres
loosened, the seeds and specks fell through, and a billowy
mass of whitish down lay before her. alt was not a healthy
occupation: dust and ﬁne released found their w_ay into the
lungs, as well as on to the ﬂoor and furniture; and a rosy-
cheeked batter was a myth. Machinery does the work now——
but this history deals with then ./
During the week dust lay thick on everything ,' even Bessy’s
hair was ﬂuffy as a bursting cotton pod, in spite of the ker-
,cliief tied across it; but on the Saturday, when she had carried
her work to Simpson’s factory in Miller’s Lane, and came back
with her wages, broom and duster cleared away the ﬁlm ; wax
and brush polished up the oak bureaurathe pride and glory of
their kitchen; the two slim iron candlesticks, fender and poker
were burnished bright as steel ; the three-legged round deal
table was scrubbed white; and then, mounted on tall pattens,
she set about with mop and pail, and a long-handled stone, to
cleanse the ﬂag ﬂoor from the week’s impurities.
She had had a good mother, and, to the best of her ability,
Bess tried to follow in her footsteps, and ﬁll the vacant place
on her father’s hearth, and in his heart. Her mother had been
dead four years, and Bess, now close upon twenty, had since
then lost two brothers, and lamented as lost one dearer than a
brother—the two former by death, the other by the ﬁerce
demands of war. She had a pale, interesting face, with dark
hair and thoughtful, deep grey eyes, and was, if anything, too

quiet and staid for her years; but when her face lit up she had
as .pleasant a smile upon it as one would wish to see by one’s
ﬁreside, and not even her dialect could make her voice other-
wise than low and gentle.
Both her brothers had been considerably younger than her-
self; and possibly the fact of having stood in [am parentz's to
them for upwards of two years had imparted to her the air of
motherliness she possessed. Certain it is that if a child in the
yard scalded itself, or cut a ﬁnger, or knocked the'bark off an
angular limb, it went crying to Bessy Clegg in preference to its
own mother ; and she healed bruises and quarrels with the
same balsam—loving sympathy. She was just the one to open
her arms and heart to a poor motherless babe, and Simon
Clegg knew it.
Old Simon, or old Clegg, he was called, probably because
he was graver and more serious than his fellows, and had
never changed his master since he grew to manhood ; certainly
not on account of his age, which trembled on the verge of ﬁfty,
only. He was a short, somewhat spare man, with a face
deeply lined by sorrow for the loved ones he had lost. But
he had a merry twinkling eye, and was not without a latent
vein of humour. The atmosphere of the tannery might have
shrivelled his skin, but it had not withered his heart ; and
when he handed the child he had saved to his daughter, he
never stopped to calculate contingencies.
The boy, apparently between two and three months’ old,
was dressed in a long gown of printed linen had a muslin cap,
and an under one of ﬂannel, all neatly made, but neither in
make nor material beyond those of a respectable working-man’s
child; and there was not a mark upon anything which could
give a clue to its parEntag'e.
The painted wooden cradle, which had been to it an ark
of safety, was placed in a corner by the ﬁreplace ; and an old
bottle, ﬁlled with thin gruel. over the neck of which Bess had
tied a loose cap of punctured wash-leather, was so adjusted that
the little one, deprived of its mother, could lie within and feed
itself whilst Bess herself indlistriously pursued her avocations.
These were not times for idleness. There had been bread-
riots the previous Winter; food still was at famine prices ; and
it was all a poor man could do. with the strictest industry and
economy, to obtain a bare subsistence. So Bess worked away
all the harder, because there were times when babvdom was
imperative, and would be nursed.

She had put the last garnishing touches to her kitchen on
Saturday night, had taken oﬂ” her wrapper-brat} put on a clean
blue bedgown,1L and substituted a white linen cap for the
coloured kerchief, when her father, who had been to New
Cross Market to make his bargains by himself on this occasion,
came into the kitchen, followed by Cooper, who having helped
to save the child, naturally felt an interest in him.
The iron porridge-pot was on the low ﬁre, and Bess, sifting
the oatmeal into the boiling water with the left hand, whilst
with the other she beat it swiftly with her porridge-stick, was
so intent on the preparation of their supper, she did not notice
their entrance until her father, putting his coarse wicker.
market-basket down on her white table, bade Cooper “ Coom
in an’ tak’ a cheer.”
Instead of taking a chair, the man walked as quietly as his
clogs would let him to the cradle, and looked down on the
infant sucking vigorously at the delusive bottle. Mat Cooper
was the unhappy father of eight, whose maintenance was a
sore perplexity to him ; and it may be supposed he spoke with
authority when he exclaimed—
“ Whoy, he tak’s t’ th’ pap-bottle as nat’rally as if he’n ne’er
had nowt else !” ' ‘
And the big man—quite a contrast to Simon—stooped and
lifted the babe from the cradle with all the ease of long prac~
tice, and dandled it in his arms, saying as he did so,
“ Let’s hev a look at th’ little chap. Aw’ve not seen the
colour 0’ his eyen yet,”
The eyes were grey, so dark they might have passed for
black; and there was in them more than the ordinary inquiring
gaze of babyhood.
“ Well, thah’rt a pratty lad ; but had thah bin th’ fowesti i’
o’ Lankisheer, aw’d a-thowt thi mammy’d ha’ speered§ fur thi
afore this,” added he, sitting down, and nodding to the child,
which crowed in his face.
“Ah! one would ha’ reckoned so,” assented Bess, without
turning round. '
“ What ar’ ta gooin’ to do, Simon, toward fandin’ th’ choilt’s
kin ? ” next questioned their visitor.
Simon looked puzzled.
“ Whoy, aw’ve hardly gi’en it a thowt.”
But the question, once started, was discussed at some length.
Meanwhile the porridge destined for two Bess poured into

three bowls, placing three iron spoons beside them, with no
more ceremony than, “ Ye’ll tak’ a sup wi’ us, Ma .”
Mat apologised, feeling quite assured there was no more
than the two could have eaten,- but Simon looked hurt, and
the porridge was appetising to a hungry man ; so he handed
the baby to the young woman, took up his spoon, and the
broken thread of conversation was renewed at intervals. What
they said matters not so much as what they did.
The next morning being Sunday, Cooper called for Clegg
just as the bells were ringing for church ; and the two, arrayed
in their best fustian breeches, long-tailed, deep-cuffed coats,
-knitted hose, three-cornered hats, and shoes, only kept for
Sunday wear, set out to seek the parents of the unclaimed
infant, nothing doubting that they were going to carry solace
to sorrowing hearts. '
Their course lay in the same track as the Irk, now pursuing
its course as smilingly under the bright August sun as though
its banks were not strewed with wreck, and foul with thick
offensive mud, and the wOeful devastation were none of its
doing. There were fewer houses on their route than now, and
they kept close as possible to the course of the river, question-
ing the various inhabitants as they went along. They had
gone through Collyhurst and Blaker without rousing anyone to
a thought beyond self-sustained damage, or gaining a single
. item of intelligence, though they made many a detour in quest
of it. At a roadside public-house close to Middleton they sat
down parched with heat and thirst, called for amug of ale each,
drew from their pockets thick hunks of brown bread and
cheese, wrapped in blue and white check handkerchiefs, and
whilst satisfying their hunger, came to the conclusion that no
cradle could have drifted safely so far, crossing weirs and mill
dams amongst uprooted bushes, timber, and household chattels
and that it was best to turn back.
In Smedley Vale, where the ﬂood seemed to have done its
worst, and where a small cottage close to the river lay in ruins,
a knot of people were gathered together talking and gesticu-
lating as if in eager controversy. As they approached, they
were spied by one of the group.
“ Here are th’ chaps as fund th’ babby, an’ want’n to know
who it belungs to,” cried he, a youth whom they had interro-
gated early in the day.
To tell in brief what Simon and his companion learned by
slow degrees—the hapless child was alone in the world,

orphaned by a succession of misfortunes. ‘ The dilapidated
cottage had been for some ﬁfteen months the home of its
parents. The father, who was understood to have come from
Crumpsall with his young wife and her aged mother, had been
sent for to attend the death-bed of a brother in Liverpool, and
had never been heard of since. The alarm and trouble con-
sequent upon his prolonged absence prostrated the young wife
and caused not only the babe’s premature birth, but the
mother’s death. The care of the child had devolved upon the
stricken grandmother, who had him brought up by hand, as
Matthew’s sagacity had suggested. She was a woman far
advanced in years, and feeble, but she asked no help from
neighbours or parish, though her poverty was apparent. She
kept poultry and knitted stockings, and managed to eke out a
living somehow, but how, none of those scattered neighbours
seemed to know—she had “ held her yead so hoig ” (pursued
her way so quietly). .
She had been out in her garden feeding her fowls, when the
ﬂood came upon them without warning, swept through the
open doors of the cottage, and carried cradle and everything
else before it, leaving hardly a wall standing. In endeavouring
to save the child she herself got seriously hurt, and was with
diﬂiculty rescued. But between grief and fright, bruises and
the drenching, the old dame succumbed, and died on the
Thursday morning, and had been buried by the parish—from
which in life she had proudly kept aloof—that very afternoon,
and no one could tell other name she had borne than Nan.
Bess sobbed aloud when she heard her father’s recital,
which lost nothing of its pathos from the homely vernacular in
which it was couched.
“An’ what’s to be done neaw? ” asked Cooper, as he sat on
one of the rush-bottomed chairs, sucking the knob of his walk-
ing-stick, as if for an inspiration. . “ Yo canno’ think 0’ keep-
ing th’ choilt, an’ bread an’ meal at sich a proice l”.
“ Connot oi? Then aw conno’ think 0’ aught else.
Wouldst. ha’ me chuck it i’ th’ river agen? What dost thah say,
Bess? ” turning to his daughter, who had the child on her lap.
" Whoi, th’ poor little lad’s got noather feyther nor mother,
an’ thah’s lost boath o’ thi lads. Mebbe it’s a Godsend,
feyther, after 0’, as yo said’n to me,” and she kissed it
tenderly. ~
“ Eh, wench I ” interposed Matthew, but she went on with—
out heeding him.

“ An’ aw con do ’bout ’bacca, lass. If the orphan’s granny
wur too preawd to ax help 0’ th’ parish, aw’ll be too preawd to
send her pratty grandchoilt theer.”
An so, to Matthew Cooper’s amazement, it was settled. But
the extra labour and self-denial it involved on the part of Bess,
neither Matthew nor Simon could estimate.
In the midst of the rabid scepticism and Republicanism of
the period, Simon Clegg was a staunch “ Church and King ”
man, and, as a natural consequence, a stout upholder of their
ordinances. Regularly as the bell tolled in for Sunday morn-
ing service, he might be seen walking reverently down the aisle
of the old church, to his place in the free seats, with his neat, _
cheerful-looking daughter following him sometimes, but not
always—so regularly that the stout beadle missed him from
his seat the Sunday after the inundation, and meeting him in '
the churchyard a week later, sought to learn the why and
wherefore.
The beadle of the parish church was an important personage
in the eyes of Simon Clegg ; and, somewhat proud of his
notice, the little tanner related the incidents of that memorable
ﬂood-week to his querist, concluding with his adoption of the
child. ,
The ofﬁcial h’md and ha’d, applauded the act, but shook
his powdered head, and added, sagely, that it was a “ greeat
charge, a varry greeat charge.”
“ Dun yo’ think th’ little un’s bin babtised?” interrogated
the beadle.
“ Aw conno" tell; nob’dy couldn’t tell nowt abeawt th’ choilt,
’ut wur ony use to onybody. Bess an’ me han talked it ower,
an’ we \vur thinkin 0’ bringin’ it to be kirsened, to be on th’
safe soide loike. Aw reckon it wouldna do th’ choilt ony harm
to be kirsened twoice ower; an’ ’twoud be loike ﬁingin’ th’
choilt’s soul to Owd Scrat gin he wur no kirsened at 0’. What
dun yo’ thinkin’ P ”
The beadle thought pretty much the same as Simon, and it
was ﬁnally arranged that Simon should present the young
foundling for baptism in the course of the week.

CHAPTER THE THIRD.*
HOW THE REV. JOSHUAV BROOKES AND SIMON CLEGG INTERPRETED
A SHAKESPERIAN TEXT.
ANCHESTER had at that date two eccentric clergy-
men attached to the Collegiate Church. The one,
Parson Gatliﬁ'e, a ﬁne man, a polished gentleman, an eloquent
preacher, but a 6012 vz'wnt of whom many odd stories are told. '
The other, the Reverend Joshua Brookes, a short, stumpy man
(so like to the old knave of clubs in mourning that the
sobriquet of the “ Knave of Clubs” stuck to him), was a
rough, crusted, unpolished black-diamond, hasty in temper,
harsh in tone, blunt in speech and in the pulpit, but with a
true heart beating under the angular external crystals ; and he
was a good liver of another sort than his colleague.
He was the son of a crippled and not too sober shoemaker,
who, when the boy’s intense desire for learning had attracted
the attention and patronage of Parson Ainscough, went to the
homes of several of the wealthy denizens of the town, to ask
for pecuniary aid to send his son Joshua to college. The
youth’s scholarly attainments had already obtained him an exhi-
bition at the Free Grammar School,rwhich, coupled with the
donations obtained by his father and the helping hand of
Parson Ainscough, enabled him to keep his terms and to
graduate at Brazenose, to become a master- in the grammar
school in which he had been taught, and ‘a chaplain in the
Collegiate Church. -
So conscientious was he in the performance of his sacred
duties that, albeit he was wont to exercise his calling after a
peculiarly rough fashion of his- own, he married, christened,
buried more people during his ministry than all the other-
ecclesiastics put together.
It was to this Joshua Brookes (few ever thought of preﬁxing

the “ Reverend” in referring to him) that Simon Clegg
brought “Nan’s” orphan grandchild to be baptised on Tues~
day, the 7th of September, just three weeks from the date of
his involuntary voyage down the ﬂooded Irk.
It had taken the tanner the whole of the week following his
conversation with the beadle to determine the name he should
give the child, and many had been his consultations with Bess
on the subject. That very Sunday he had gone home from
church full of the matter, and lifting his big old Bible from its
post of honour on the top of the bureau (it was his whole
library), he sat, after dinner, with his head in his hands and
his elbows on the table, debating the momentous question.
“Yo’ see, Bess,” said he, “a neame as sticks to one all
one’s loife, is noan so sma’ a matter as some folk reckon. An’
yon’s noan a common choilt. It is na ev’ry day, no, nor ev’ry
year, as a choilt is weshed down a river in a kayther, an’ saved
from th’ very jaws of deeath.* An’ aw’d loike to gi’e -un a
neame as ’ud mak’ it remember it, an’ thenk God for his
marcifu’ preservation a’ th’ days 0’ his loife.”
After a long pause, during which Bess took the baby from
the cradle, tucked a napkin under its chin, and began to feed it
with a spoon, he resumed—
“Yo’ see, Bess, hadna aw bin kirsened Simon, aw moight
ha’ bin a cobbler, or a whitster,‘|' or a wayver, or 0in else. But
feyther could read tho’ he couldna wroite; an’ as he wur a
reed-makker, he towt mi moi A B C wi’ crookin’ up th’ bits
0’ wires he couldna use into th’ shaps 0’ th’ letters ; an’ when
aw could spell sma’ words gradely,§ he towt mi to read out 0’
this varry book; an’ aw read 0’ Simon a tanner, an’ nowt ’ud
sarve mi but aw mun be a tanner too, so tha sees theer’s
summat i’ a neame after 0’.” .
Bess suggested that he should be called Noah, because Noah
was saved in the ark; but he objected that Noah was an old
greybeard, with a family, and that he knew the ﬂood was
coming, .and built the ark himself; he was not “ takken
unawares in his helplessness loike that poor babby.”
Moses was her next proposition—Bess had learned some-
thing of Biblical lore at the ﬁrst Sunday-school Manchester
could boast, the one in Gun Street, founded by Simeon Newton
in 1'788—but Simon was not satisﬁed even with Moses.
“ Yo’ see, Moses wur put in’ th" ark o’ bullrushes o’ purpose,

an’ noather thee nor- mi’s a Pharaoh’s dowter, an’ th’ little
chap’s not loike to be browt 00p i’ a pallis.”
Towards the end of the week he burst into the room ; “ Oi
hev it, lass, oi hev it! We’n co’ the lad ‘Irk ,' ’ nob’dy’ll hev
a neame loike that, and it’ll tell its own story ; an’ fur th’ after—
neame, aw reckon he mun tak’ ours.”
Marriages were solemnized in the richly-carved choir of the
venerable old Church, but churchings and baptisms in a large
adjoining chapel ; and thither Bess, who carried the baby,
was ushered, followed by Simon and Mat Cooper, who were to
act as its other sponsors.
At the door they made way for the entrance of a party of
ladies, whom they had seen alight from sedan-chairs at the
upper gate, where a couple of gentlemen joined them. A
nurse followed, with a baby, whose christening robe, nearly
two yards long, was a mass of rich embroidery. The mother
herself—a slight, lovely creature, additionally pale and delicate
from her late ordeal—wore a long, plain-skirted dress of vari-
coloured brocaded silk. A lustrous silk scarf, trimmed with
costly lace, enveloped her shoulders. Her head-dress, a
bonnet with a bag-crown and Quakerish poke-brim, was of the
newest fashion, as were the long kid gloves which covered her
arms to the elbows.
The party stepped forward as though precedence was theirs
of right even at the church door, heeding not Simon’s
mannerly withdrawal to let them pass; and the very nurse
looked disdainfully at the calico gown of the baby in the round
arms of Bess, a woman in a grey duffel cloak and old-fashioned
flat, broad-brimmed hat.
Is there any thrill, sympathetic or antagonistic, in baby- ‘
‘veins, as they thus meet there for the ﬁrst time on their
entrance into the church and the broad path of life? For the
ﬁrst time—but scarcely for the last. '
> ' Already a goodly crowd of mothers, babies, godfathers, and“
godmothers had assembled—a crowd of all grades, judging'
from their exteriors, for dress had not then ceased to be a
criterion; and all ceremonies of this kind were performed in
shoals—not singly.
The Rev. Joshua Brookes, followed by his clerk, came
through the door in the carven screen, between the choir and
baptismal chapel, and took his place behind the altar rails.
And now ensued a scene which some of my readers may think
incredible, but which was common enough then, and there,
r"

and is notoriously true. The width of the altar could scarcely
accommodate the number of women waiting to be churched ;
and the impatient Joshua assisted the apparitors to marshal
them to their places, with a sharp “You come here! You
kneel there ! Yon woman’s not paid !” accompanied by pulls
and pushes, until the semi-circle was ﬁlled.
But still the shrinking lady, and another, unused to jostle
with rough crowds, were left standing outside the pale.
Impetuous Joshua had begun the service before all were
settled. “ F orasmuch as it hath pleased ”
His quick eye caught the outstanding ﬁgures. Abruptly
stopping his exordium, he exclaimed, in his harsh tones, which
seemed to intimidate the lady,
“What are you standing there for P Can’t you ﬁnd a place P
Make room here!” (pushing two women apart by the shoul-
der), “ thrutch up closer there ! Make haste, and kneel
here l” (to the lady, pulling her forward). “You come here ;
-—make .room, will you P ” and having pulled and pushed them
into place, he resumed the service.
Presently there was another outburst. There had been a
hushing of whimpering babies, and a maternal smothering of
infantile cries, as a chorus throughout ; but one fractious little
one screamed right out, and refused to be comforted. The
nervous tremor on that kneeling lady’s countenance might
have told to whom it belonged, had Joshua been a skilful
reader of hearts and faces. His irritable temper got the better
of him. He broke off in the midst of the psalm to call out,
“ stop that crying child l” The crying child did not stop. In
the midst of another verse he bawled, “Give that screaming
babby the breast l” He went on. The clerk had pronounced
the “ Amen” at the end of the psalm,- the chaplain followed,
“Let us vpray;” but before he began the prayer, he again
shouted, “Take that squalling babby outl”—an order the
indignant nurse precipitately obeyed; and the service ended
without further interruption.
Then followed the christenings, and another marshalling
(this time of godfathers and godmothers, with the infants they
presented), in which the hasty chaplain did his part with hands
and voice until all were arranged to his satisfaction.
It so happened that the tanner’s group and the lady’s group
were ranked side by side. The latter was Mrs. Aspinall, the
wife of a wealthy cotton merchant, who, with two other gentle~
men and a lady, stood behind her, and this time gave her

their much-needed support. Indeed, what with the damp and
chillness of the church, and the agitation, the delicate lady
appeared ready to faint.
“Hath this child been already baptised or no P” asked
Joshua Brookes, and was passing on, when Simon’s unexpected
response arrested him.
“Aw dunnot know.”
“ Don’t know? How’s that? What are you here for? ”
were questions huddled one on the other, in a broader
vernacular than I have thought well to put in the mouth of a
man so deeply learned.
“ Whoi, yo’ see, this is the choilt as wur weshed deawn th’
river wi’ th’ ﬂood in a kayther ; an’ o’ belungin’ th’ lad are,
deead, an’ aw mun kirsen him to mak’ 0’ sure.” '
Joshua listened with more patience than might have been
expected from him, and passed on with a mere “ Humph l” to
ask the same question from each in succession, before proceed-
ing with the general service. At length he came to the
naming of several infants. -
“ Henrietta Burdelia Fitzbourne,” was given as the proposed
name of a girl of middle-class parents.
“ Malfy, I baptise thee,” 810., he calmly proceeded, handed
the baby back to the astonished godmother, and passed to the
next, regardless of appeal.
Mrs. Aspinall’s boy took his name of Laurence with a noisy
protest against the sprinkling. Nor was the foundling silent
when, having been duly informed that the boy’s name was to
be “Irk,” self-willed Joshua deliberately, and with scarcely a
visible pause, went on— - -
“jabez, I baptise thee in the name,” &c., and so overturned
at one fell swoop, all Simon’s carefully-constructed castle.
Simon attempted to remonstrate, but Joshua Brookes had
another infant in his arms, and was deaf to, all but his own busi-
ness. Such a substitution of names was too common a practice
of his to disturb him in the least. But Simon had a brave
spirit, and stood no more in awe of Joshua Brookes—“Jotty ”
as he was called—than of another man. When the others had
gone in a crowd to the vestry to register the baptisms, he
stopped to confront the parson as he left the altar.
“ What roight had yo’ to change the neame aw chuse to gi’e
that choilt P ”
“What right had yo’ to saddle the poor lad with an Irksome
name like that? ” was the quick rejoinder. ‘

“ Roight 1 why, aw wanted to gi’e th’ lad a neame as should
mak’ him thankful fur bein’ saved from dreawndin’ to the last
deays 0’ his loife.”
“An friesome name like that would have made him the butt
of every little imp in the gutters, until he’d have been ready to
drown himself to get rid of it. Jabez is an honourable name,
man. You go home, and look through your Bible till you
ﬁnd it.”
Simon was open to conviction 3 his bright eyes twinkled as a
new light dawned upon them. a
The gruff chaplain had brushed past him on his way to the
robing-room ; but he turned back, with his right hand in his
breeches pocket, and put a seven-shilling piece in the palm of
the tanner, saying :
“ Here’s something towards the christening feast of th’ little
chap I’ve stood godfather to. And don’t you forget to look in
‘ Chronicles’ for Jabez ; and, above all, see that the lad doesn’t
disgrace his name.”
Joshua Brookes had the character, among those who knew
him least, of loving money overmuch, and this unwonted exhi-
bition of generosity took Simon’s breath.
The chaplain was gone before he recovered from his amaze-
ment—gone, with a tender heart softened towards the father-
less child thrown upon the world, his cynicism rebuked by the
true charity of the poor tanner, who had taken the foundling
to his home in a season of woeful dearth.
And, to his credit be it said, the Rev. Joshua Brookes never
lost sight of either Simon or little Jabez. He was wont to
throw out words which he meant to be in season, but his harsh,
abrupt manner, as a rule, neutralized the effect of his im-
promptu teachings. No“ however, the seed was thrown in
other ground; and, as he intended, Simon’s curiosity was
excited. The Bible was reverently lifted from the bureau as
soon as they reached home, and, after some seeking, the pas-
sage was found.
Simon’s reading was nothing to boast of, but Cooper could
not read at all ; and in the eyes of his unlettered comrades
Clegg shone as a learned man. He could decipher “black
print,” and that, in his days, amongst his class, was a distinc-
tion. Slowly he traced his ﬁngers along the lines for his own
information, and then still more slowly, with a sort of rest after
every word, read out to his auditors—Bess, Matthew, and
Matthew’s wife (there in her best gown and best temper)—

with slight dialectal peculiarities, which 'need not be re-
produced——
“And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and
his mother called his name Jabez, because she bare him with
sorrow. And j'abez called on the God of Israel, saying, 0 that
thou wouldst bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that
thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldst keep me
from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him
that which he requested.” *
“ Eh, Simon, mon, owd Jotty wur woiser nor thee. Theere’s
a neame fur a lad to stand by! It’s as good as a 1eeapin’-
pow’f that it is, t’ help him ower th’ brucksl an’ rucks§ 0’ th'
warld.”
Simon sat lost in thought. At length he raised his head,
and remarked soberly—
“Parson Brookes moight ha’ bin a prophet; th’ choilt’s
mother did bear him wi’ sorrow. The neame ﬁts th’ lad as if
it had bin meade fur him.”
“Then aw hope he’s a prophet 0’ eawt, feyther, an’ 0’ th’
rest’ll come true in toime,” briskly interjected Bess ; adding——
“ Coom, tay’s ready ; ” further appending for the information of
their visitors—“ Madam Clough sent the tay an’ sugar, an’ th’
big curran’-loaf, when hoo heeard as feyther had axed for a
holiday fur the kirsenin’ ; an’ Mester Clough’s sen some yale
[ale], an’ a thumpin’ piece 0’ beef.”
“ Ay, lass ,' an, as we’n a’ready a foine kirsenin’ feast, we’n
no change parson’s seven-shillin’ piece, but lay it oop fur th’
lad hissen.”
But the christening feast did not proceed without sundry
noisy demonstrations from Master Jabez. If, as Simon had
once hinted, he was an angel in the house, he ﬂapped his wings
and blew his trumpet pretty noisily at times.
“ Eh, lass, aw wish Tum wur here neaw, to enjoy hisself wi’
us. Aw wonder what he’d say to see yo’ nursin’ a babby so
bonnily? ” ‘
Simon was munching a huge piece of currant-cake as he
uttered this, after a meditative pause. A look of pain passed
over Bessy’s face. She rarely mentioned the absent Tom,
though he was seldom out of her thoughts.
“ Yea, an’ aw wish he wur here !” she echoed :with a sigh,

the fountain of which was deep in her own breast. “Aw

“Feightin’, mebbe l” suggested her father.
“Killed, mebbe l” was the fearful suggestion of her own
heart, and she was silent for some time afterwards.
But the feast proceeded merrily for all that, and no wonder,
wher; Charity was president. And there was quite as happy

assembled in the grand house at Ardwick, where Master Lau_
rence Aspinall was handed about in his embroidered robes
for the inspection of guests who cared very little about him,
although they did present him with silver mugs, and spoons,
and corals, and protest to his pale and exhausted mamma that
he was the ﬁnest infant in Manchester.

CHAPTER THE FOURTH.
M 1 s c H 1 E r.
T was a time of distress at home and war abroad. Glory’s
scarlet fever was as rife an epidemic in Manchester as
elsewhere. The town bristled with bayonets ; corps of volun-
teers in showy uniforms, on parade or exercise, with banners
ﬂying, dotted it like spots on a peacock’s tail; the music of
drum and ﬁfe drowned the murmurs of discontented men, the
groans of poverty-stricken women, and the cries of famishing
children. All nostrums were prescribed for the evils of famine
except a stoppage of the war. The rich made sacriﬁces for
the poor; pastry was banished by common consent from the
tables of the wealthy in order to cheapen ﬂour ; soup-kitchens
were established for the poor, and in the midst of the general
dearth the nineteenth century struggled into existence.
It was this war-fever which had carried off Bessy Clegg’s
sweetheart, Thomas Hulme, to Ireland, in Lord Wilton’s
Regiment of Lancashire Volunteers, three years before. The
honest, true-hearted fellow could not write for himself, postage
was expensive and uncertain, and in all those three years
only two letters, written by a comrade, had reached the girl.
To her simple, uninformed mind, Ireland was as foreign and
distant a country as Australia is to us in these days. And to
be stationed there with his regiment amongst those “wild
Irishmen,” conveyed only the idea of battles and bloodshed.
Yet she kept a brave heart on the matter, and hid her anxieties
from her father as well as she was able. In some respects
little Jabez was a Godsend to her. The frequent attention
he required combined with her labours at the batting-frame,
and her household duties, tended to distract her mind from
the dark picture over which she was so much inclined to brood,
and to make her, if anything, more cheerful. Once more the
voice which had been silent tuned up in song, for the gratiﬁca-

tion of the youngster, and in amusing him she insensibly
cheered and refreshed herself.
Yet as she trilled her quaint ballads, or Sabbath-school
hymns, she little thought her vocalization was to furnish an
envious mind with a shaft to wound herself, and the one of all
others dearer than herself. -
Soon after the memorable christening feast, Matthew Cooper
and his family had removed—or “ﬂitted,” as they called it—
from Barlow’s Yards to Skinners’ Yard; and Sally, that peace-
able man’s termagant wife, was not the most desirable of
neighbours. The tea, and the currant-cake, and the beef, on
that unusually well-spread board, had ﬁlled her with pleasure
for the time, but turned to gall and bitterness ere they were
digested. Why should the Cleggs be so high in the favour of
Mr. and Madam Clough, and her Mat get nothing better than
half-a-crown-piece? He’d quite as much to do in saving the
brat’s life as Simon had, and with such a family, wanted it a
ﬁne sight more. So she argued and argued with herself, quite
ignoring, or blind to the fact that it was not the mere impulse '
which saved, but the humanity which kept the babe, that Mr.
Clough recognized, and never lost sight of.
As Simon grew in favour at the tannery, the more excited
grew Sally Cooper, until nothing would do but a removal to the
opposite yard, where she could see for herself the “gooin’s on 0’
them Cleggs ;” and once there, she contrived to harass Bess .
by numberless little spiteful acts, as well as by her vituperative
tongue. ’
Nor did little Jabez himself escape. Parson Brookes, grum-
bling loudly at every downward step, found his way to Bess 0’
Sims, guided by the quick-swishing, regular beat of the batting-
wands.
Mrs. Clough having, by ocular demonstration, satisﬁed her-
self that Bess was a sufﬁciently notable house-wife and a kindly
nurse, had replaced the worn out long-clothes which Jabez in-
herited from “brother Joe,” by'a set of more serviceable and
suitable short ones; had, moreover, sent an embrocation to
allay Simon’s rheumatic pains, and to crown the whole, sup-
plied a go-cart for the boy, to help him to walk, and yet leave
the hands of industrious Bess at liberty.
As Miss Jewsbury has said, in her exquisite story of “The
Rivals,” that go-cart “was the drop added to the brimming
cup, the touch given to the falling column.”
Mat’s worse-half—~an inveterately clean woman, be it said——

was occupied with her Saturday’s “ redding up,” when she saw
the wood-turner carry it in; and she thereupon trundled her
mop at the door so vigorously and viciously, that the children
instinctively shrank into corners, or ran out of the yard alto-
gether, beyond reach of her weighty arm. And as, one by one,
they ventured back, after what they thought a safe interval,
creeping stealthily over the freshly-sanded ﬂoor, and mayhap
leaving the impression of wet clogs thereon, jerks, cuffs, and
slaps were administered with a freedom born of her supposed
wrongs. ,
When Mat came home, to offer his wages upon the house-
hold altar, the storm had not subsided, and he was fain to
retreat to the quiet ﬁreside of Simon to smoke his pipe in
peace, and escape its pitiless peltings. He could not have
selected a worse haven. It was a ﬂagrant going over to the
enemy. Thither she followed him in her wrath, and in her
blind fury assailed not only him, but Bess, Simon, Mr. Clough,
and Joshua Brookes, whom she mingled in indiscriminate con-
fusion, casting aspersions on the girl, which wounded nobody
more than her own husband.
In the midst and in spite of all this, Jabez grew apace.
Life was not altogether sweetened for him by Mrs. Clough’s
kindness, only made a little less bitter, and certainly not less
hard ; since almost his ﬁrst experience with the go-cart was to
tilt at the open doorway, and pitch head-foremost down a ﬂight
of three steps into the stony yard, whence frightened Bess
raised him, with a bleeding nose and a great bump on his fore-
head, amidst the mocking laughter of Sal Cooper.
A chair was overturned across the doorway as a barrier, until
Simon could place a sliding foot_board there. But Jabez had
still many a knock against chair or table until Bess made a
padded roll for his forehead, as a protective coronal. Then
every tooth cost him a convulsion, and any one less patient
and tender hearted than Bess would have abandoned her self-
imposed charge in despair, his accidents and ailments made
such inroads on her rest and on her time.
But even patience has its limits, and Sally Cooper strained the
cable until it snapped. At a war of words Bess was no match
for her antagonist : and, rather than endure a second contest,
the Cleggs left the ﬁery serpent behind, and quitted the yard.
Not willingly, for Simon, contrary to the roving habits of
ordinary weekly tenants, had not changed his abode since his
wedding-day, and the river was as a friend to him. He de-

clared he “ could na sleep 0’ neets without th’ wayter singin’ to
him.” However, he contrived to ﬁnd a very similar tenement,
in just such another cul—a’e-rac, with just such another tripe-
dresser’s cellar underneath, and that, too, without quitting
Long Millgate. Midway between the college and the tannery
this court was situated, its narrow mouth opening to the
breezes wafting down Hanover Street: they could still look
out on the verdure of Walker‘s Croft, and the Irk laved its
stony base as at that same Skinner’s Yard, which Simon lived
to see demolished.
It was May; bright, sunny, perfumed May. The hawthorn
hedges on the ridge of the croft were white with scented
blossoms, and the Irk—not the muddled stream which improve-
ment is fast shutting out of remembrance—went on its
dimpled way, smiling at the promise of the season. The
echoes of the May-day milkcart bells, and the flutter of their
decorative ribbons, were dying out of all but infantile remem-
brance ;——the month was more than a fortnight old.
It was 1802, and Jabez was almost three years old. He was
running, or rather scrambling, about the uneven court, gather-
ing strength of limb and lung from their free use, albeit at
the cost of dirt on frock and face, and the trouble of washing
for Bessv
She was singing at her batting-frame—not an unusual thing
now, for rumour had whispered in her ear that the Lancashire
Volunteers were on their homeward march. Even as she sang,
a stout young fellow in uniform stopped at the narrow entrance
of the court, and questioned two or three gossiping women,
who, with arms akimbo, blocked up the passage, if they knew
the whereabouts of Simon Clegg, the tanner, and his daughter
Bess.
‘FWhat! th’ wench as has the love-choilt?” answered one
of the women.
“The girl I mean had no child when I saw her last,”
responded he, between his set teeth.
“ Happen that’s some toime sin’, mester, or it’s not th’ same
lass. That’s her singin’ like a throstle o’er her work at the
oppen winder.”
“And that’s her choilt,” said another, ending by a lusty call,
“jabez, lad, coom hither! -
Jabez, taught to obey his elders, came at a trot, in answer
to the woman’s call. The volunteer looked down upon him.
The child had neither Bess’s eyes nor Bess’s features ,- but he

heard the voice of Bess, and over the woman’s shoulder he
caught a glimpse of her face at the distant window. It was
Bess, sure enough !
Sick at heart, Tom Hulme, for it was he, leaned for support
against the side of the dark entry. These women but con-
ﬁrmed what he had heard in Skinners’ Yard from Matt Cooper’s
vindictive wife. The deep shadow of the entry hid his change
of countenance. Without a condemnatory word, without a
step forward towards the girl whose heart was full of him, he
steadied himself and his voice, and mustering courage to say,
“No, that is not the lass I want,” strode resolutely out of the
entry; and, bending his steps to the right, turned up Toad
Lane, and so on to the “Seven Stars,” in Withy Grove, where
he was billeted.
He had come back from Ireland full of hope, and this was
the end of it l He had been constant, and she was frail ! She
whom he had left so pure had sunk so low that, though she
bore the brand of shame, she could sing blithely at her work,
unconscious or reckless of her degradation! Torn had only been
a hand-loom weaver, and was but a private in his regiment, but
he had a soul as constant in love, as sensitive to disgrace, as
the proudest ofﬁcer in the corps. He might have doubted
Sally Cooper’s artful insinuations, but for the unconscious con-
ﬁrmation of the other women, and the personal testimony of
poor little Jabez 3 the innocent child, borne with sorrow by his own
dead mother, bringing sorrow to his living maiden-foster-mother.
The little lispings of the child conveyed no impression to
Bess’s understanding, but one of the women bawled out to her
from the open court—
“ Aw say, theer’s bin a volunteer chap axin’ fur a lass neamed
Bess Clegg, but he saw thee from th’ entry, and said yo’re not
th’ lass he wanted 1 ”
Her heart gave a great leap, and the blood ﬂushed up to her
pale face. Could it be possible that there was another Bess
Clegg of whom a volunteer could be in search? Yet, had that
been her Tom, he would have known his Bess again, even
after ﬁve—ay, or twenty years. She would know him anywhere!
And so all that day, and the next, her heart kept in a ﬂutter of
expectation and perplexity. She wondered he did not come.
The regiment was in town ; he surely had not been misled in
his inquiries because they had “ ﬂitted.” Yet in all her thoughts
the grim reality had no place. Her perfect innocence and single-
ness of heart had never suggested such a possibility to her.

The days went by from the I 3th to the 22nd, yet he came
not. After working-hours Simon tried to hunt him up; but
the billeting system, and ill-lighted streets, set his simple tactics
at deﬁance. On the latter day, Lord Wilton gave a dinner in
the quadrangle of the College, to the non-commissioned oﬂicers
and privates in his regiment, to celebrate their return, and the
peace and plenty then restored to the land.
At the ﬁrst sound of ﬁfe and drum, Bess snatched up Jabez,
and leaving house and batting-frame to take care of themselves,
rushed along the street to the “ Sun Inn” corner, where Long
Millgate turns at a sharp angle, the old Grammar School and
the Chetham College gate standing at the outer bend of the
elbow. The better to see, she mounted the steps of the house
next to the “ Sun "—a house kept by a leather-breeches maker,
——and strained her eyes as the gay procession wound from the
apple~market, passed the handsome black-and-white frame-
house of the Grammar School’s head-master, and, with banners
ﬂying and drums beating, marched under the ancient arched
gateway between a double row of blue-coat boys.
She held Jabez high up in her arms to let him see, and his
little arms clasped her neck, as she scanned every passing sol-
dier’s features. Two thirds of the corps had passedwshe saw
the loved and looked-for face, and, radiant with delight, stretched
forward, and in eager tones called—“ Tom l”
There was a mutual start of recognition; two faces crimsoned
to the brow 3 then one white as ashes, a keen, meaning glance
at the child, teeth clenched, and eyes set with stem resolution ;
and, without another look, without a word, Tom Hulme went
on under the Whale’s-jawbone gateway; and Bess, with brain
bewildered, hands and limbs relaxed, sank on the breeches-
maker’s steps in a dead faint. -
A lady (Mrs. Chadwick) who had a little girl by the hand,
caught Jabez as they fell, and putting his hand in her daugh-
ter’s, bade her take care of him—she was perhaps a year or
two older than he,—whilst she raised the poor young woman’s
head, and applied a smelling-bottle to her nose.
Strange parting, strange meeting! How close the founts of
sweet and bitter waters lie! How often separate streams of
life meet and part again ,- some to meet and blend in after
years, some to meet never more !
Another week, and Lord Wilton’s Lancashire volunteer
regiment had a man the less, the line had a. man the mOIe~
Private Thomas Hulme had exchanged.

CHAPTER THE FIFTH.”r
ELLEN CHADWICK.
HE song of the human throstle was heard no more ﬂoat-
ing across the batting-frame out of the window of its
cage, in the dreary yard on the banks of the Irk. The swish
of the wands might be heard when other sounds were low, but
no more snatches of melody ﬂowed in between.
Kind-hearted Mrs. Chadwick had not been content to leave
poor Bessy at the breeches-maker’s when her swoon was over;
but, seeing that the girl continued in a dazed kind of stupor,
sent to the adjoining “Sun Inn ” for cold brandy-and-water,
to stimulate the dormant mind. Bess drank, half unconsciously,
and Mrs. Chadwick, leaving her little daughter Ellen to
amuse astonished Jabez, waited patiently until the young
woman could collect her ideas, and not only tell where she
lived, but prepare to walk home.
By that time the road was tolerably clear. Mrs. Chadwick
thanked the breeches-maker, and bidding Miss Ellen march
in advance with little Jabez, herself helped Bessy Clegg home-
'ward.
She never asked herself why or wherefore the girl had fainted,
or whose the child she carried in her arms. She merely saw
a modest-looking young woman stricken down by illness or
distress, and put out a Christian hand to help her.
It was past Simon’s dinner-hour, and they found him on the
look-out for the absentees. He was more bewildered than
Bess when he saw her brought home pale and trembling by a
stranger, whose dress and manner bespoke her superior station.
Mrs. Chadwick explained, seeing that Bess was incapable.
“ The poor girl fainted almost opposite to the College
gate, as she watched Earl Wilton’s regiment march past.
" See Appendix C.

She recovered so slowly, I was afraid to let her come
through the streets unprotected, especially as she had so young
a child in her charge.”
Simon thanked her, as well he might. Benevolence will
relieve distress with money, or passing words of sympathy, but
it is not often silken skirt and satin bonnet walk through a
crowded thoroughfare in close conjunction with bonnetless
cotton and linsey.
Yet Simon was utterly at a loss to account for her swoon.
He could only conjecture that she had missed her sweetheart
from the corps, and that the inquiring volunteer had been a.
comrade sent to announce Tom Hulme’s death. Observing
how much he was confounded, the good lady thought it best
to retire, and leave them to themselves.
“ Come, Ellen, it is time we went home.”
But Ellen, seated on a low stool in the corner, had her lap
full of broken toys, which had found their way hither from the
Clough nursery, and which Jabez displayed to all comers.
“ My daughter appears ‘onderfulIy attracted to your little
grandson.”
“ He’s noa gran’son 0’ moine, Misses, though aw think aw
love th’ little lad as much as if he did belung to us. Aw just
picked him eawt 0’ th’ wayter, i’ th’ greet ﬂood abeawt two year
an’ hauve back. Aw dunnot know reetly who th’ young un
belungs to.”
“ And you have kept him ever since—through all the trying
time of scarcity? ”
“ Yoi; aw could do no other, an’ a little chap like jabez
couldna ate much.”
“ It does you credit,” said the lady.
“ Mebbe. Aw dunnot know. Aw dunnot see mich credit
i’ doin’ one’s clear duty. But aw think theer’d ha’ bin dis-
credit an’ aw hadna done it.”
“ I wish everyone shared your sentiments,” replied she.
By this time the little girl had relinquished the toys, kissed
the little boy patronisingly, and was by her mother’s side, ready
to depart. A word of sympathy and encouragement from Mrs.
Chadwick, and father and daughter were left alone with their
new sorrow.
Sorely puzzled was Simon to account for Tom Hulme’s
strange conduct. He could only come to the conclpswn that
he had picked up a fresh sweetheart in Ireland, and was
ashamed to show his face.

30 The Manchester Man.
“ An’ if so, lass, yo’re best off without him,” said he.
The stern, troubled look on the young volunteer’s face,
which Bess had seen and her father had not, he could not
understand, and therefore could not credit.
One day the girl said, as if struck by a sudden thought—
“ Feyther, aw saw Tum look hard at Jabez. Dun yo’ think
as heaw he fancied aw wur wed ? ” .
“ He moight, lass, he moight,” said he, knocking the ashes
out of his pipe ; “but dunnot thee fret; aw’ll look Turn up,
and set it o’ reet, if that’s 0’.”
But there was no setting it right, for by that time Tom had 5
left the corps and the town, and thenceforth Bessy’s musical '
pipe was out of tune, and stopped utterly. She worked, it is ‘
true, but she had no heart in her work ; and though before
her father she kept up a show of cheerfulness, in his absence
she had shed many and bitter tears.
Smiles and tears are among a child’s earliest perceptions and
experiences. Of the mother’s smile in its full sense jabez
knew nothing. With all her winning ways, Bess could never
supply that want, if want it could be where it was never missed,
having so good a substitute. But of the change which came
over her when she knew that Tom was indeed lost to her, even
the three years child could be sensible. He had been early
taught to show a brave front when he hurt himself, and the
starting tears would subdue to a whimper; but, for all that,
tears to.him meant pain or disappointment, and as they fell
and wetted the (not always clean) little cheek laid lovingly
against hers, a tender chord was struck,- he would press his
small arm tighter round her neck, and with a_ sympathetic
“ Don’t ky, Beth!” nestle closer, and try to kiss away the
drops, which only fell the faster.
Low-spirited nurses do not make lively children, and Jabez,
after a stout tussle with the whooping-cough, began to droop
as much as Bess; so clear-eyed Simon instituted a series of
Sunday rambles for the three, in search of plants and posies, ‘
to brighten their dull home, and of bloom to brighten the
fading cheeks. Sometimes Matt Cooper, with one or two of
his youngsters, would join them, but not often ; Sal was so
jealous of his friendship with the Cleggs, and the pleasant day
was so certain to be marred by an unpleasant reception in the
evening at home.
These Summer walks seldom extended beyond Collyhurst
Clough and quarries, or Smedley Vale, or through the ﬁelds to

Chetham Hill, stopping at the “ Cow and Calf ” to refresh, and
rest the little ones, before they came back laden with wild
ﬂowers down Red Bank and over Scotland Bridge, to their
respective “ yards” in Long Millgate.‘
At ﬁrst, whenever they took the lower road through Ange]
Meadow, they did. their best to ferret out the parentage and
connections of Jabez, hoping by their inquiries even .to keep
alive the memory of his marvellous deliverance, so that in case
the missing father should return, there might be a mutual
restoration.
These Sunday excursions did not drop with the sere
autumnal leaves. A crisp clear day called them forth surely
as sunshine had done, Jabez mounting pick-a-back on the
shoulders of Simon or Matt when his little feet could no longer
keep up their trot beside the bigger Cooper boys. Frames
were invigorated, cheerfulness came back to face and home,
and Simon, who had a deep-seated love of Nature in his soul,
ﬁnding her so good a physician, kept up the acquaintance
through rounding seasons and years. And from Nature he
drew lessons. which he dropped as seed into the boy’s heart,
as unconscious of the great work he was doing as was Iabez
himself.
The boy throve and grew hardy. Companionship with older
and rougher lads, sturdy fellows with wills of their own, made‘
him sturdy too ; a lad who would take a blow and give one on
occasion ,' who would run a race and lose, and a second, and
third, until he could win. But Bessy’s gentle training was
something very different from Sal’s, and Jabez grew up tender
as well as strong and bold.
, A_ persecuted kitten had taken refuge under Bessy’s batting-
frame in the foundling’s go-cart days, and in care for that
kitten, and for a wounded brown linnet brought home one
Sunday, he learned humanity. Matthew’s lads were ‘given to
bird-nesting, and Matt himself saw no harm in it; but when
that young linnet’s wing was broken in a scufﬂe for the nest
stolen from a clump of brushwood, Simon read the robbers
such a homily they had never heard in their young lives, and
as a corollary he took the bird home to be fed and nursed by
Bess and Jabez till it could ﬂy, an event which never came
about.
In hot weather the lads pulled off clogs and stockings (there
were no trousers to turn up—they wore breeches), and waded
into pools and brooks, and Jabez would be no whit behind.

On one-of these occasions, either the current was too strong
for the venturesome child, or the gravel slipped from under
his feet, or his companions pushed him—no matter which,—
but in he went, and, but for the presence of Simon, would
have been drowned. Simon had been born on the river-banks,
and could swim like a ﬁsh. At once be resolved that Jabez
should learn to do the same, and begin at once.
“ Yo’ see, Bess, if aw hadna bin theer he’d a bin dreawnded,
sure as wayter’s wet, an’ th’ third toime pays off fur o’ ; so he
mun larn to tak’ care on himsel’ th’ next toime he marlocks
[gambols] among th’ Jack-sharps.”
Jabez was not six years old when Simon Clegg gave him and
the young Coopers their ﬁrst lesson in swimming, in a delight-
ful and sequestered part of Smedley Vale, where the Irk was
clear and bright. He had shown them, nearer home, how a
frog used its limbs, and then, after a few preliminary evolu-
tions, to show how a man used his, took the lad on his back,
and, after swimming with him awhile shook him off into the
water to ﬂounder about for himself.
Bess was often left at home on Sundays after that; and
Jabez was not merely the better for his bath, but by the time
he was eight years old was a fearless swimmer.
Yet, although these country rambles had become an institu-
tion, Simon Clegg never neglected his Sabbath duties. Sunday
morning was sure to see him, clean-shaven, in his best suit,
with Jabez by the hand, and mild-eyed Bess beside, on the
free seats of the Old Church, under the eye of parsons and
churchwardens; and Jabez if he could understand little of the
service, could gather in a sense of the beautiful from the grand
old architecture, from the swell of the solemn organ, the
harmonious voices of the choristers—of the Blue-coat boys in
the Chetham-gallery over the churchwarden’s pew, and of the
Green-coat children farther on. Then the silver mace carried
before the parson was a thing to wonder at, and ﬁll him with
awe; and no one could tell how the clerical robes, and
choristers’ surplices, transﬁgured common mortals in his
admiring eyes. ‘
But those years of Jabez Clegg’s young life had
been full of history for Manchester and Europe. The
town had grown as well as the foundling. Invention had
been busy. Volunteer regiments had been one by one
disbanded, a daily newspaper was started, and peaceful
arts ﬂourished. Then, ere another year expired, Napoleon

declared the British Isles in a state of blockade; British
subjects on French soil, whether civil or military, to be
prisoners of war: British commodities lawful spoil; and so
War—red-handed War—broke loose once more. Again Man-
chester rose up in arms to defend country and commerce.
A “ Loyalty Fund” of £ 22,000 was raised for the support of
Government. No fewer than nine separate volunteer corps
sprang from the ashes of the old ones, and the town was one
huge garrison. The commander of one regiment—the Loyal
Masonic Riﬂe Volunteer Corps,—Colonel Hanson—a remark-
able man in many ways,—was distinguished by a command
from George III. to appear at Court in full regimentals, and
with his hat on.
Messrs. Pickford offered to place at the disposal of Govern-
ment four hundred horses, ﬁfty waggons, and twenty-eight
boats. Loyal townsmen, with more money than courage 'of
their own, sought to stimulate that of others by sending gold
medals ﬂying amongst the ofﬁcers of the volunteer corps.
“ The British Volunteer ” came from the press of Harrop in
the Market Place, and once more the music of drum and
trumpet was in the ascendant.
To crown the whole, Manchester, which had never been
called upon to entertain British Royalty since Henry VII.
looked in upon the infant town, was visited in 1804 by Prince
William, Duke of Gloucester, commander of the North-west
District, and his son, to review this Lancashire volunteer
army ; and the whole town was consequently in a ferment of
excitement. Nothing was thought of, or talked of, but the
visit of the Duke and Prince, and the coming review, the
more so as reports differed respecting the appointed site.
Market Street, Manchester, which a well-known writer has
commemorated as one of the “ Streets of the World,” was then
Market Street Lane, a confused medley of shops and private
houses, varying from the low and ricketty black-and-white tene-
ment of no pretensions, to the ﬁne mansion with an imposing
frontage, and ample space before. But the thoroughfare was
in places so very narrow that two vehicles could not pass, and
pedestrians on the footpath were compelled to take refuge in
doorways from the muddy wheels which threatened damage
to dainty garments; and the whole was ill-paved and worse
lighted.
At the corner where it opens a vent for the warehouse traffic
of High Street, [/1612 stood a handsome new hotel, the Bridge-

water Arms, in front of which a semi-circular area was railed
off with wooden posts and suspended chains. Within this area,
on the bright morning of April the 12th, two sentinels were
placed, who, marching backwards and forwards, crossed and
re-crossed each other in front of the hotel door; tokens that
the Royal Duke and his suite had taken up their quarters
within.
Beyond the semi-circle of chained posts, mounted horse-
men kept back the concourse of spectators which pressed
closely on the horses’ heels. Among the crowd was Simon
Clegg, with jabez mounted on his shoulders, albeit he was a
somewhat heavy load. Simon was a man of peace, but he was
a staunch believer in Royalty, and that, quite as much as the
spectacle, had drawn him thither.
It was a mild and cheery April morn ; the windows of the
upper room in which sat the Prince, the centre of a brilliant
circle, were open, and the loyal multitude feasted their
unaccustomed eyes with the sight. As jabez looked on in a
child’s ravishment, a little dark-haired, dark-eyed girl, some
six or seven years old, turned sharply round the narrow street
by the side of the hotel on the ﬂags where there was no chain
to bar ; passing unquestioned the sentinel on guard, who, see-
ing only a well-dressed solitary child in white muslin, with a
sash and hat-ribbons of pink satin, concluded that she belonged
to the hotel. Once there, she asked fearlessly—-
“ Where is Prince. William ? I want Prince William ! ”
Then the sentinel began to question ; but the little maid had
but one reply—
“ I want Prince William l”
The soldier would have turned her back: but the disputa-
tion had attracted attention in the room above.
An ofﬁcer’s head was thrust out.
“ What’s the matter P” asked he.
“ I want to see the Prince. I want to know ”
“ Bid the little lady come up hither.”
And the little lady went up, all unconscious of state etiquette
or ceremonial.
An ofﬁcer in rich uniform, with jewels on his breast, took
her on his knee, and asked what she wanted with Prince
William.
“Oh, mamma and my aunts are wanting ever so to know if
the review is going to be on Camp Field or on Sale Moor ; and
Aunt Ellen says it’s to be in one place, and mamma thinks it’s

the other 3 and so, as I was dressed ﬁrst, I just slipped out at
the back door, and ran here to ask Prince William himself, for
I thought he would be sure to know.”
_'I‘ he gentleman laughed heartily, and the others followed
suit.
“ And who is your mamma, my dear P ”
“My mamma is Mrs. Chadwick, and I’m Ellen Chadwick;
and we live in Oldham Street.” '
“ Oh, indeed! And why are the ladies so anxious to know
where the Prince holds the review?” asked the ofﬁcer on
whose knee she sat.
“ Ah—that’s just it. If he reviews at Sale Moor, he will
go past our house 3 and then we shall see all the soldiers from
our own windows. Won’t it be ﬁne ? ”
Another gentleman asked what the ladies were doing when
' she left,- and I’m afraid Ellen made more revelations anent
their toilettes than were strictly necessary, for the laughter was
prolonged.
She had not, however, lost sight of her self-imposed mission.
Struggling from her seat, she said—
" Oh, please do tell me where is Prince William ,- I must go
home, and I do so-want to know.”
“ Tell your mamma, Miss Ellen,” said he, smiling, “that
the Prince will review at Sale Moor; and take this, my dear,
for yourself,” putting a shilling (shillings at that time were
perfectly plain from over-long use) in her hand.
“ Oh, thank you! But are you sure—quite sure it is Sale
Moor ? ”
“ Quite sure.” I
The little damsel'set off, as much elated With her news as
with her shilling. As she ran briskly down the broad steps,
and beyond the barrier, she came in cOntact with Simon, who
made way for her exit ; and, as she looked up smiling to thank
him, her glance rested for a moment on the boy he carried;
but no spark of recognition ﬂashed into the eyes of either, and
no one in all that crowd saw any connection between that
dainty white-frocked, pink-slippered, pink-sashed miss, and the
rough lad in the patched suit (a Clough’s cast-oﬁ) and wooden
clogs.

CHAPTER THE SIXTH.
TO MARTIAL MUSIC.
' SECOND time Iabez and Ellen saw each other ere the
A day was out.
She had rushed home with eager feet and eyes, through
back streets, to startle Mrs. Chadwick, her newly-married
sister, Mrs. Ashton, and a bevy of friends, with the conﬁdent‘
assurance that the review would be at Sale, and to conﬁrm it
by the display of the plain shilling, which “an osifer had given
her.”
New Cross, where the volunteers assembled, was not then a
misnomer. A market cross occupied the centre space between
the four wide thoroughfares, of which Oldham Street is one ;
and the open area was considerable.
The trumpets’ bray, the tramp of troops, were heard long
before the brilliant cavalcade was set in motion; and every
window—every house in Oldham Street (all good private
residences of the Gower Street stamp) held its quota of heads
and eyes, and costumes as brilliant as the eyes.
The house of Mr. Chadwick was situated near the lower
end, and commanded a good view of the Inﬁrmary, its gardens,
and pond in Piccadilly. To-day, however, the royal party and
the volunteers, many of whom had friends looking out for
them, were the only prospect worth a thought; and as they
marched proudly on, to the gayest of gay tunes, kerchiefs
waved, heads nodded, and eyes sparkled with delight and
pleasure.
As the Duke of Gloucester and his suite rode by, their
chargers prancing to the music, Ellen, mounted on a chair by
the window between Mrs. Ashton and her mother, suddenly
pointed to an ofﬁcer in their midst, resplendent with stars and
orders, and in an ecstasy of delight screamed out——
,“ Mamma, mamma ! that’s the gentleman that gave me the
shilling ! ”

The little treble voice pierced even through the clamorous
music. A noble head was bowed, a plumed hat was raised,
and lowered until it swept the charger’s mane.
“Why, child, that is Prince William !” was the simultaneous
exclamation, as all the eyes from all the houses across the
street were turned in wonderment to see the Chadwicks so
distinguished; and Simon, who, still carrying Jabez, was try-
ing to keep pace with the troops, wondered too. Moreover,
he recognised the lady and little girl, though seen but once;
for he earned his own living, such as it was, and had been too
proud to call on the Chadwicks to say how his daughter fared
lest they should think he sought charity.
“ Jabez, lad, si thi, yon’s th’ lady and little lass as browt yo’
whoam, when yo’ went seein’ the sodgers afore ! ”
And Jabez, from his shoulder-perch, looked up at the little
bright-eyed brunette, to remember the white frock and pink
ribbons he had seen at the Bridgewater, but nothing beyond.
The man’s exclamation and attitude had at the same time
attracted Mrs. Chadwick, who, smiling down on him and
Jabez, spoke to Ellen ; and she, reminded of the little baby
who had been saved from drowning in a cradle, looked down
and, in the fulness of her new importance, nodded too.
The momentary stoppage called forth a loud objurgation as
a. reminder from Sally Cooper, who was in advance with
Matthew and such of her bigger lads as could step out; and
Simon, equally anxious not to lose sight of the royal party,
hurried on. But Sale Moor is beyond the conﬁnes of Lanca-
shire, and Simon found the ﬁve miles stiff walking, with a child
nearly six years old on his shoulders, and Master Jabez had to
descend from his seat, and trudge on his own feet. This
caused them to lag behind their friends, Sally insisting on Matt’s
keeping up with the soldiers, in order that they might get a
good place on the Moor, and they were thus separated. Bess
had remained at home. Never again could she look on march-
ing troops without a pang. ' .
Sale Moor was alive with expectant sightseers. Stands and
platforms had been erected for the accommodation of those
who could afford and cared to pay ; there was a sprinkling of
heavy carriages, and a crowd of carts, but the mass of
spectators were on foot, vehicular locomotion being of very
limited capacity.

ground in time to be deafened by the score of cannon Lord
Wilton’s artillery ﬁred as a salute to princedom. She had
planted herself ﬁrmly against one of the supports of an elevated
platform, where the crowd of hero-worshippers was densest.
She was tightly jammed and crushed against the woodwork;
but what matter ? she had a ﬁne sight of the ﬁeld, and as she
watched the evolutions of the volunteers, congratulated herself
and Matthew on having left “ that crawling Clegg an’ th’ brat
so far behint.”
Almost as she spoke, there was a faint crackle, then another,
and a yielding of the post against which she leaned—a loud
crash, a chorus of shrieks, half drowned by music and musketry,
and the whole platform was down, with the living freight it
had borne ; and she was down with it.
The fashion, wealth, and beauty of Cheshire and South
Lancashire had their representatives amongst that struggling,
swooning, writhing, shrieking, groaning mass of humanity,
heaped and huddled in indiscriminate confusion, with up-torn
seats, posts, and draperies. Strange to say, only one person
was killed outright—that is, on the spot—for in its downfall
the stand bore with it many of the throng beneath. But of
the injured and the shaken, those who went to hospital and
home to linger long and die at last, history has kept no
record.
Amongst these, this story tells of two—two differing in all
but sex. Mrs. Aspinall, ever frail and delicate, was borne to
her carriage with whole limbs, but insensible, her husband
and their son Laurence both uninjured by her side. Physicians
were in attendance, and never left her until she was safely
' lodged in her own luxurious chamber, overlooking Ardwick
Green, and could be pronounced out of immediate danger.
Sally Cooper, with a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and
many internal bruises, was placed in a light cart on a bed of
straw procured from a neighbouring farm, with another of the
injured, and carried to the Manchester Inﬁrmary, to try the
skill and the patience of the doctors and nurses.
Neither recovered. The unwounded lady, sorely shaken,
succumbed to the shock her nervous system had received ; and
Master Laurence, already petted and wilful, was left to be
still farther spoiled by his widowed father and Kitty, his
mother’s old nurse. Sally, strong of frame and will, impa-
tient of pain and of restraint, was restive under the surgeons’
hands, and defeated their efforts to ascertain her injuries.

She exhausted herself with shrieks and cries, tossed about
and disturbed bandages, rejected physic, which she called
“poison,” and soon put her case beyond the cure of phy-
sicians. Too late, she became sensible of her own folly.
Then, when recovery was impossible, she repented of many
misdeeds, and of none more than her slander of poor Bess.
And thus it was. When the mother was taken from the
head of Cooper’s home, Bessy’s kind heart yearned to help
the disconsolate man and his troop of children. Fortunately,
the eldest was a girl of sixteen, and there was a younger girl
of ten. Both of these had gone out to work, but now Molly
had to stay at home and try to keep all right and tight there.
And here Bess came to her aid. Without scolding or brawling,
she put the girl into the way of doing things quickly and
quietly. She encouraged her to persevere, so that her cleanly
mother should detect no eyesores when she came home re-
stored. She tried to persuade the boys to \be less'refractory
—to help, not to irritate, their sister; and somehow Cooper’s
home began to miss Sal, much as one misses a whirlwind.
The kindness of Bess o’ Sim’s was duly reported to the
Inﬁrmary patient, and at ﬁrst chafed her sorely. She “ hated
to be under obligations, and to that lass 0’ all others.” But Bess,
leaving her own work—and the loss of an hour meant the
loss of an hour’s earnings—herself went to see Sally; and
such was the influence of her gentle voice and touch, that
Sally’s chagrin imperceptibly wore away.
Towards the last she grew delirious, raved of Bess and
Tom Hulme and forgiveness, and in the short calm preceding
dissolution, confessed to Matt Cooper and the attendant
nurse that she had cast a slur on Bess Clegg’s good name. Had
made Tom Hulme believe that Simon had taken the lass from
Skinner’s Yard to hide her shame. That everybody in the
yard knew that Bess had a child. And that she had bade
him inquire for himself. And almost her last word was a hope
that Bess would forgive her.
Matthew Cooper himself hardly forgave his dead wife.
How, therefore, should he carry this confession to Bess, and
ask her to forgive? He took a medium course; and after a
few days’ consideration, while they and the rest of the tanners
were eating their “ baggin ” (a workman’s luncheon, so called
from the bag it is, or was, usually carried in), sat down beside
Simon on a bundle of thick leather, and told him as well as
he was able.

Simon was troubled ; but he was not vindictive. He would
have been less than a man had he not been bitter against the
cruel woman who had causelessly wrecked his good daughter’s
life. But he was sorry for Matt, and broke out into no
revilings. The woman was dead. The ill she had done had
been fearfully punished, and neither curses nor reproaches
could affect her or undo the mischief.
He left his cheese and jannock on the hides untasted,
drew his hand across his forehead, and went down to the
river-side and across the wooden bridge for a breath of fresh
air and a waft of fresh thought. He was only a rugged tanner,
but he had a heart within his breast; he had a daughter on
his hearth with a great wound in her heart, a blast on her good
name, and he was called upon to forgive the author of this
mischief !
Simon had long been used to commune with his own
heart. He had built up a wall round it with the leaves of
that one book on his bureau ; and whenever he was in doubt
or diﬁiculty, he read the precepts inscribed upon that wall.
He went back to Cooper, whose appetite had been no better
than his own.
“Aw mun think this ower, Matt. Aw connot say aw fur-
give yo’r Sal 0’ at a dash. Hoo’s done that as may niver be
undone whoile thee an’ me’s alive; an’ aw connot frame to
say as aw furgive her loike 0’ on a sudden. An’ aw mun
think it ower before eawt be said to eawr Bess, poor wench !”
A week elapsed before the subject was broached again.
Then Simon spoke to Matthew as they were leaving the
tannery-yard.
“Coom into th’ ‘Queen Anne’” (he called it quéan),
“ Matt, and have a gill; aw’ve summat t’ say to thee.”
There was nobody in the taproom. They sat down to
their half-pint horns of ale——-times were too hard to afford
deeper draughts—and Simon said:
“ Aw’ve bin thinkin’ 0’ this week, an’ as aw connot forgive
'yo’r Sal, gradely loike, aw’ll no put th’ same temptation i’ th’
way of eawr Bess. Hoo’d better think Tum’s takken 00p
wi’ some other wench, than ha’ th’ shame o’ knowin’ th’ lad’s
toorned her up i’ disgrace, Hoo’s getten ower th’ worst 0’ her
trouble, an’ awm not gooin to break her heart outreet, and
mebbe set her agen little jabez into th’ bargain.”
Matthew could but assent to Simon’s proposition. But
Simon had not said all his say.

“ But aw’m not gooin’ to sit deawn wi’ my honds i’ mi’ lap,
an’ that great lump 0’ dirty slutch stickin’ to moi lass. Yo’
mun help me t’ ﬁnd eawt wheer Tum Hulme’s getten to, an’
help to set 0’ straight afore aw forgive yo’r Sal, tho’ hoo be
dead an’ gone.”
“ Wi’ 0’ my heart!” responded Matt ,- and he gave his huge
hand to Simon in token thereof.
When the Duke of Gloucester inspected the volunteers at
Ardwick on the 30th of September that same year, not one
of the people I have here linked together witnessed the show.
The blinds were down at Mr. Aspinall’s to shut out a sight
the like of which had made him a widower; and within the
darkened nursery, wilful, obstreperous Laurence fought and
kicked and bit at old Kitty, because she kept him within doors
and from the windows at his father’s command.
There was a christening party in Mosley Street, at the
Ashtons’, at which not only the Chadwicks, but the Rev.
Jeshua Brookes—who had that day named the infant Augusta
—were present. They had selected a public occasion for
their private festival. It was a grand aﬂair. Mr. Ashton was
a small-ware manufacturer in a large way of business, his house
and warehouse occupying a large block of buildings at the
comer of York Street. And the baby Augusta, born the
previous month, was a ﬁrst child, his wife being younger
than himself considerably. Miss Ellen, too, was there, her
wonderful shilling, through which a hole had been drilled,
suspended from her neck like an amulet.
Simon and Matt had given up their holiday to fruitless
inquiries after Tom Hulme ; and Jabez, after a stand-up ﬁght
with a boy in the yard in defence of his kitten, had come to
have his bleeding nose and bruised forehead doctored by
Bess, who shed over him the tears long gathering in their
7 fountains for Tom Hulme’s defection. And somehow at that
stylish christening feast, where the baby Augusta was a per-
sonage of importance almost as great as the celebrated Miss
Kilmansegg, the orphan Jabez and his fosterers came on the
table for discussion along with the dessert; Mrs. Chadwick,
Mr. Clough, and Joshua Brookes concurring in the opinion
mooted by the lady that something should be done to relieve
the worthy tanner and his daughter of the cost and trouble
of maintaining the boy as he grew older and would want
educating. That they should talk of the cost of maintenance
when bread was a shilling a, loaf, was no marvel; but that

“education” should be named as a necessity for one of
“nobody’s children,” can only be cited as a proof that either
the boy’s strange introduction to Manchester, or Simon’s
strange generosity, had excited an interest in both beyond the
common run.
Yet that “something” was vague. The only deﬁnite and
practicable view of the subject was held by Joshua Brookes,
and he kept his opinion to himself.

sweetmeats. These he purchased—or obtained without
purchase—from an old woman as odd and eccentric as
himself, a Mrs. Clowes, who occupied a bow-Windowed shop in
Half Street, which literally overlooked the churchyard, three or
four steep steps having to be mounted by her customers.
And how numerous were her customers, and how great the
demand for her toffy, lozenges, and “ humbugs ” may be
judged from the fact that her workmen and apprentices used
up eight or nine tons of sugar every week. Yet she was only a
shop-keeper, and had begun business in a very humble way ;
but she was persevering and industrious, and success followed.
She was active and energetic, and expected those around her
to be the same. Yet she was kind to them, as may be sup-
posed, for she gave every Sunday a good dinner to fourteen old
men and women on whom fortune had looked unkindly, wait-
ing upon them herself, and never tasting her own dinner until
her pensioners had dined. .
Regular in her own attendance at the old Church, she
required her household to be regular too, though she left them
little enough time to dress—possibly because her own toilette
was so scant. The dress in which she presented herself at
church was certainly unique for a woman of wealth. Her
gown of sober stuff was well worn ; a mob-cap (a fashion which
came in with the French Revolution) adorned her head, over
which, by way of bonnet, a brown silk handkerchief was tied.
On rare—very rare—occasions, an old black silk bonnet
covered all. _ _
Joshua Brookes, at odds with his clerical brethren, With his
pupils, and half the world besides, was on good terms With

Mrs. Clowes. Rough, prompt, and uncompromising was she;
rough, irritable and unmannerly was he ; both unpromising
hard-husked nuts, with sweet and tender kernels. So rough,
few ever suspected the soft heart 3 yet the woman who fed the
poor before herself, and the learned clergyman who had a fancy
for pigeons, and who cherished the drunken and abusive old
crippled shoemaker, his father, to the last, must have intuitively
known the inner life of each other.
The day following Augusta Ashton’s christening, it fell within
the round of the Reverend Joshua’s duty to read the burial
service over a dead townswoman in the churchyard. And now
occurred one of those incidents in which the ludicrous and the
profane blended, and brought impulsive Joshua into disfavour.
As was not unfrequently the case, he broke off in the midst of
the service, left the mourners and the coffin beside the open
grave, threw his legs over the low wall, and, mounting the steps
into the confectioner’s shop, said,
“ Here, quick, dame? Give me some horehound drops for
my coug .”
On his entrance Mrs. Clowes broke off a narrative over which
she and her shopwoman were laughing heartily, in order to reach
the required drops, which went into a paper without weighing,
and for which no payment was tendered. Back he strode over
the church wall to resume the interrupted ceremonial.
It must here be observed that Joshua had remarkably
shaggy eyebrows, overhanging his quick eyes like pent-houses,
and that it was the wont of the schoolboys and others to annoy
him by drawing their ﬁngers signiﬁcantly over their own. A
young sweep sat upon the church wall to witness the funeral,
and—young imp of Satan that he was l—he could not forbear
drawing a thumb and foreﬁnger over each brow, full in Joshua’s
sight, just as he reached the passage—“ I heard a voice from
heaven saying——-”
The shaggy eyebrows contracted ; he roared out—
“ Knock that little black rascal off the church wall I ”
The mischievous little blackamoor was off, with a beadle
after him ; and the eccentric chaplain, whom no sense of irre-
verence seemed to strike, concluded the ceremony with no
further interruption.
At its close, Mr. Aspinall and another mourner took the
clergyman to task for his disrespect to the remains of the
deceased Mrs. Aspinall, whose obsequies had been so
irregularly performed. They said nothing of disrespect to the

Divinity profaned ; their own feelings and importance had been
outraged, and they forgot all else even by the dust and ashes
in the gaping grave ; and little Laurence, cloaked and hooded,
forgot his grief in watching the chase after the sweep.
“How dare you, sir, give way to these indecencies at the
funeral of my wife P It has been most indecorous and insult-
ing, both to the dead and her aﬂiicted relatives.”
“ She’s had Christian burial, hasn’t she P ” gruffly interrogated
joshua.
“Hardly,” was the hesitating answer.
“She’s been laid in consecrated ground, and I’ve read the
burial service over her; what more would you have? Some
folk are never satisﬁed.”
Emptying half his horehound drops into the hand of Master
Laurence, joshua turned on his heel, went to the chapter—
house to disrobe, and then back over the wall to Mrs. Clowes.
“ I say, dame, you were not at church on Sunday.”
“ No, Parson Brookes ; I was in Liverpool.”
“Oh l” grunted he, “in Liverpool. Sugar-buying, I
suppose P ” '
“ Yea; an’ a ﬁne joke I’ve had.”
Joshua pricked up his ears: he did not object to a little
fun.
“You mun know I thought I’d give Branker, the new
sugar-brokers, a trial, an’ I went there and asked to see
samples ; but the young Whippet-snapper of a salesman looked
at me from top to toe, an’ I suppose, reckoned up the value
of my old black bonnet, my kerchief an’ mutch, an’ my old
stuff dress, and fancied my pocket must match my gown, for
he was barely civil, and didn’t seem to care for the trouble 0’
showin’ th’ samples. So I bade my young man good day, and
said I’d call again.”
“ And didn’t, I suppose. Just like awoman,” put in Joshua.
“ Oh, yea, I did. I borrowed my landlady’s silk gown and
ﬁne satin bonnet, and put on my lady’s manners ; and then Mr.
Whipper-snapper could show his samples, and his best manners
too. But when I gave my orders by tons, and not hundred-
weights, he looked at me, and looked again, as if he thought
I’d escaped from a madhouse ; an’ at last he began to h’m an’
ah, ari’ talk of large orders, an’ cash payment, an’ references;
an’ I told him to make out th’ invoice and bring it. An’

the bank-notes to pay him down on the nail, good gracious!

how the fellow stared! I reckon I’ll not need to borrowa
silk dress when I give my next order. It was as good as aplay.”
“Um! You women-folk think yourselves wonderfully
clever. But come, I can’t waste my time here.” (Joshua had
heard all he went for.) “Give me quarter-a-pound of humbugs;
I threw half the other things away,” said he.
“I don’t think it’s much you’ll throw away, ]otty,” replied
the old confectioner, with independent familiarity, as she
weighed and parcelled the sweets, for which this time he put
down the money.
“ It’s much you know about it, Mother Clowes,” he jerked
out, as if throwing the words at her over his shoulder, as he
turned to leave the shop, putting the package in one of the
large pockets of his long ﬂap waistcoat as he went.
His own house, not more than three hundred yards away,
adjoined the Grammar School ,- a red-brick building, with stone
quoins, now darkened by time and smoke, one gable of which
overhung the Irk ,' the other, pierced for four small-paned
windows, almost confronting the antique Sun Inn, at the
acute angle of Long Millgate, and quite overlooking an open ‘
space, ﬂanked by the main entrance to the College. From
this, the east wing of the College, it is separated by a plain
iron gateway and palisades on the Millgate side, and by a wall
which serves as a screen from the river on the other side 3 and
the enclosed space between rails, wall, College, and the front
of the school served as a playground for such scholars as were
willing to keep within bounds. It was divided into upper,
middle, and lower schools, the last being in the basement, and
designed for elementary instruction. The high and middle
schools together occupied the same long room above this.
Joshua Brookes, as second master, presided over the middle
school, and surely never M.A. had so thankless an ofﬁce. He
was placed at a terrible disadvantage in the school, not alto-
gether because he had risen from its lowest ranks—not alto-
gether because a drunken foul-mouthed cripple interfered with
their sports, or went reeling to his son’s domicile next door—
not because he was unduly severe ,' other masters were that—
but because his own eager thirst for knowledge, as a boy had
made him intolerant towards indolence, incredulous of in-
capacity; and his constitutional impatience and irritability
made his harsh voice seem harsher when he reproved a
dullard. He lost his self-command, and with that went his
command over others. Meaning to be affable to the poor,

from whose ranks he sprang, he became familiar; and they
reciprocated the familiarity so fully as to draw down the con-
tempt of his amfreres. He was a man to be respected, and
they slighted him ; a man to be honoured, and they snubbed
him. What wonder, then, that eccentricities grew like
barnacles on a ship’s keel, or that the boys failed in obedience
and respect to a master when their elders set them the
example? v
This defence of a misunderstood man has not taken up a
tithe of the time he gave to his refractory class, to whom he
went straightway from the confectioner’s, whose “humbugs”
had melted considerably, not wholly down his own throat,
»bef0re the hour when the boys closed their Latin Grammars
and Greek Lexicons, and poured as if they were mad down
the steps, and through the gate, to the road. Yet even the
sweets he gave to the attentive did not conciliate; they only
made the intractable more deﬁant; and even the recipients
felt they were bribed.
Warned by the uproar of a large school in motion, as well as
by the long-cased clock, Tabitha, his one servant, had her
master’s tea ready for him the instant he came in from the
school, as he generally did, fagged and jaded, with the growl
of a baited bear.
That day he simply put his head into the house, and
bawled, “Tea ready, Tab P” and without waiting for an
answer, went on, “Keep it hot till I get back ,'” then, closing
the door, took his way eastwards down Long Millgate. His
journey was not a long one. It ended at the bottom of a
yard where a sad pale-faced young woman was switching
monotonously at a mass of downy cotton, and listening at the
same time to the equally monotonous drawl of a youngster in
the throes of monosyllabic reading.
“Get larning, lad !—-—get larning! Larning’s a greiit thing.
Yo’ shan read i’ this big picture-book when you can spell
gradely,” had been Simon’s precept and inducement; and
Jabez, to whom that big pictorial Bible was a mysterious un-
explored crypt, did try with all his little might.

“And I hope you’re a good boy, as well as Jack,” said
Ioshua Brookes abruptly, as he put his head into the room,
and put a stop to the lesson at the same time. “But, hey-
day” (observing the swollen nose and bruised forehead),
“You’ve been in the wars. Good boys don’t ﬁght.” ~

“Then what did Bill Barnes throw stones at ar pussy for?
Good boys dunnot hurt kittlins,” said Jabez, nothing daunted.
Bess explained.
“Um!” quoth Joshua, when she had ﬁnished, “he’s fond
of his kitten, is he ?” and drawing jabez towards him by the
shoulder, with one ﬁnger uplifted as a caution, he looked
down on the shrinking child, and said, impressively—
“Never ﬁght if you can help it, Jabez ; but if you ﬁght to
save a poor dumb animal from ill-usage, or to protect the
weak against the strong, Jotty Brucks is not the man to blame
you. Here, lad,” and into the pinafore of Jabez went the
remainder of the “ humbugs.”
He patted the boy on the head, bade him get on with his .
reading, he did not know what good fortune might come of it,
told him to come regularly to church, to love God and God’s
creatures, and went away, leaving Bess to prepare her fathel’s
porridge (tea was from twelve to sixteen shillings a pound, and
beyond their reach).
Almost on the threshold he encountered Simon.
“Can’t you keep that young sprig out of mischief? If he
begins ﬁghting and quarrelling at six years old, what will he do
when he is sixteen?” he cried, grufﬂy, as he brushed past the
tanner, and was far up the yard before the man could think of
a reply. '
A couple of young pigeons were sent for Jabez about a
week after, with a large bag of stale cakes and bread to feed
them with. The name of the sender was unknown, but
anyone acquainted with the habits of Joshua Brookes (who
contracted for Mrs. Clowes’s waste pastry, to ﬁll the crops of
his own feathered colony) would not have been troubled to guess.
Simon stroked his raspy chin, and seemed dubious, cost of
keep being a question ; but Jabez looked so wistful, his foster-
father borrowed tools and answered the appeal by making a
triangular cote for them, and Jabez found fresh occupation in
their care. Yet occupation was not lacking, young as he was.
He could fetch and carry, run short errands, and help Bess to
clean. Their living-room no longer waited a week to be swept
and dusted, Jabez did it every day, standing on a chair to
reach the top of the bureau, where lay the cynosure of his
young eyes He still took his Sunday lessons in ﬁeld or
stream with Simon, and through the week clambered up from
monosyllables to dissyllables with Bess.

Legislature has stepped in to regulate the age and hours
for labour in manufacturing districts, and to provide education
for the very humblest. jabez Clegg was not born in these
blissful times, and he only narrowly escaped the common lot.
He was not eight years old, yet Simon, on whom war-prices
pressed as heavily as on his neighbours, began to discuss with
Bess the necessity for sending the lad to Simpson’s factory
(where Arkwright’s machinery was ﬁrst set in motion).
“ He mun goo as sune as the new year taks a fair grip,” de-
cided Simon, and 1805 was at its last gasp as he said it.
But the new year brought Jabez a reprieve by the uncourtly
hands of Joshua Brookes. Meeting Simon and Jabez at a stall
in the Apple—market, where, the better to bargain, he had laid
down a pile of old classical school-books (Joshua was a collec-
tor of these, which he retailed again to the boys at prices
varying with his mood, or his estimate of the purchaser’s
ocket), he accosted the former.
“Well, old Leathershanks, what are you going to make of
young Cheat-the-ﬁshes there? I suppose he’s to follow your
own trade, he began to Ian hides so early P” And the glance
which shot from under his shaggy brows caused the boy to
blush, and shrink behind his protector.
Simon’s eyes twinkled, but he shook his head as he
answered :
“ Nay, Parson Bruks, we’n thowt o’ sendin’ him t’ th’ cotton
fact’ry; but it fair goos agen th’ grain to send th’ little chap
through th’ streets to wark Winter an’ Summer, weet or dry,

“ H’m ! Then what a stupid old leather-head you must be
not to think of the College, where he’d be kept and fed and
clothed and educated !—educated, man—do you hear P”
Simon heard, and his eyes again twinkled and winked at the
new idea presented to him.
“And apprenticed ! ” he echoed, with a long-drawn, gasping
breath. ‘
“ Ay, and apprenticed.”
The parson, cramming his pockets with apples, for which he
had higgled with much persistence, handed one to Jabez with
the question— I
“ How would you like to be a College boy, Jabez, and wear
along blue coat, like that fellow yonder” (pointing to a boy
then crossing the market on an errand), “and learn to write
and cipher, as well as to read P ”
“If you please’n, aw’d loike it moore nor eawt.” And his
animated face was a clearer answer than his words.
Joshua then read the lad a brief homily to the effect that
only good and honourable boys could ﬁnd admission, winding
up with— ‘
“ If you’re a 21er good lad, I’ll see what can be done for
you.” ”
He interrupted thanks with—
“ Easter’s very near, Sim, so you’ll have to stir your stumps
to prove that our honeurable young friend came honourably
into the world. I’ll get the forms and ﬁll them up for you, and
his baptismal register too.”
He snatched up his books and was off, the tassel of his col-
legiate cap and the cassock he wore ﬂying loose as he hurried
away muttering to himself—
“ What an old fool I am to bother about the lad ! I dare-
say he’ll turn round and sting me in the end, like the rest of

Manchester, was brought up to the Church, and in the four-
teenth century inducted into the Rectory of Manchester, his
father being patron. His elder brother dying at the close of
the century, the rector (a pious Churchman) became baron.
And then he put his power and wealth to sacerdotal uses. He
petitioned the king, obtained a grant to collegiate Christ
Church, erected the College, endowed it with lands; and here
at his death the Warden of the Collegiate Church had his
residence. Of these wardens, the celebrated Dr. Dee, whose
explorations into alchemy and other occult sciences brought
him into trouble with Queen Elizabeth, was one,- and Dr. Dee’s
room is still extant—in occupation of the governor.
In 1580, at Crumpsall Hall, Humphrey Chetham was born;
and he, a prosperous dealer in fustians, never marrying, at his
own expense fed and clothed a number of poor boys ; and, by
his will, not only bequeathed a large sum of money to be
expended in the foundation and endowment of a hospital for
the maintenance, education, and apprenticing of forty poor
boys for ever, but one thousand pounds to be expended in a
library, free to the public—iheﬁrstfrae library in Britain /
The estate was vested in feoffees, and with them lay the
power alike to elect boys and oﬁicials. From the townships
of Droylsden, Crumpsall, Bolton-le-Moors, and Turton, the
boys were to be elected between the ages of six and ten, and
were required to be of honest, industrious parents, and neither
illegitimate nor diseased; and baptismal registers had to be
produced. They had to be well maintained, Well-trained, and
carefully apprenticed at fourteen, a fee of four pounds (a large
sum in Humphrey Chetham’s time) being given with them.
The churchwardens and overseers were to prepare lists of boys,
doubling the number of vacancies, stating their respective
claims, which lists they had to sign. /
Easter Monday was the period for election, after which the
feof’fees dined together in Dr. Dee’s quaintly-carved room.
Joshua Brookes was as good as his word. He procured a
blank form from the governor, and, Simon being no great
Scholar, ﬁlled it in for him. He found him the baptismal
register without charging the regulation shilling, got the name
of Jabez inserted in the churchwardens’ list, and such inﬂuence
as he had with feoffees he exerted to the utmost, for the case
was one involving doubt and difﬁculty. _
Nor had Simon Clegg been idle. He and 1115 crony
Matthew scoured Smedley and Crumpsall, and more successful

than in their quest for Tom Hulme, discovered the nurse who
presided at the birth of Jabez. Her testimony, so far as it
went, was important. He had interested both Mr. and Mrs.
Clough in the election of the foundling, and where the in-
ﬂuence of the gentleman failed, that of the lady prevailed ; so
that when the important Easter Monday arrived, two-thirds of
the feoffees were fully acquainted with his peculiar case, and
more or less impressed in his favour.
It was on the 18th of April, bright, sunny, joyous. Com-
pared with its present proportions, Manchester, then was but
as a cameo brooch on a mantle of green ; and that green was
already starred with daisies, buttercups, primroses, and cow-
slips. By wells and brooks, daffodil and jonquil hung their
heads and breathed out perfume. Bush and tree put out pale
buds and fans of promise. The tit-lark sang, the cuckoo—to
use a village phrase—had “ eaten up the mud ,'” and the town
was alive with holiday-makers from all the country round about.
It was the great College anniversary, not only election day,
but one set apart for friends to visit Blue-coat boys already on
the foundation, and for the curious public to inspect the
Chetham Museum.
The main entrance in Millgate (said to be arched with the
jaw-bone of a whale) and the smaller gate On Hunt’s Bank,
were both thrown open. A stream of people of all grades, in
festival array, poured in and out, and College cap and gown
seemed to be ubiquitous.
The pale, sad widow or widower, holding an orphan boy by
the trembling hand, the uncle or next of kin to the doubly-
orphaned candidate were there, standing in a long line ranged
against the building, and representing hopes and fears and
eventualities little heeded by the shifting stream of gazers.
For the previous week Mrs. Clowes and her assistants had
been working night and day: her shop was in a stage of siege.
Every boy, and every boy’s friend, seemed to have pocket-
money to spend, and to want to spend it over her counter,
Then it was the great wedding-day of the year, and the church-
yard swarmed like a hive; from every one of the many public-
houses round College and Church, music and mirth, clattering
feet, and loud-voiced laughter issued. “The Apple Tree,”
“ The Pack Horse,” “The Ring 0’ Bells,” “ The Blackamoor’s
Head,” were ﬁlled to repletion with wedding guests; whilst
“The College Inn,” and the old “ Sun Inn,” held a less bois-
terous quota of the Collegians’ friends and relatives.

On those wet days when outdoor play was impossible, the
boys, besides daming their stockings, occupied their spare
hours in carving spoons and apple-scrapers out of bone, in
working balls and pincushions with coloured worsted in fanci-
ful devices, and a stitch locally known as “collegingg” and
with these, on Easter Monday and at Whitsuntide, they reaped
a harvest of pocket-money, having liberty to offer them for
sale. And when it is remembered that our notable female
ancestors, poor and rich, wore indoors a pincushion and
sheathed scissors suspended at their sides, it is not to be
wondered that these found ready purchasers as memorials of
the visit.
But in that College Yard were anxious and expectant as
well as buoyant faces. And there in that line, waiting to be
called when their turn came, stood Jabez between Simon
Clegg and Bess, with Matthew and the nurse on either hand.
And ever and anon their eyes went up to the oriel vwindow
which faced the main entrance, for in the room it lighted the
arbiters of the boy’s destiny sat in judgment on some other
orphan’s claim. At length the summons came for “Jabez
Clegg.”
With palpitating hearts—~for any body of men with irrespon-
sible powers is an awful tribunal—they passed under the arched
portal at the western angle of the building, following their
guide past the doors of the great kitchen on the right hand,
and Dr. Dee’s room and the boys’ refectory on the left, up
the wide stone staircase, with its massive carved oak balusters,
along the gallery, at once library and museum, where gaping
holiday-folk followed a Blue-coat cicerone past shelves and
glass cases, and compartments separated for readers' quiet
study by carven book-shelf screens, hearing but heeding little
of the parrot~roll the boys checked off: “Here’s Oliver
Crummle’s sword; theer’s a loadstone; theer’s a hairy mon;
theer’s the skeleton of a mon ;” and so forth, but following
their own guide to the nail-studded oaken door of the feoffees’
room—that door which might open to hope, only to close on
disappointment. _
The feoffees’ room—now the reading-room of the library—
deserves more than a passing notice. It is a large, square,
antique chamber, with a deeply recessed Oriel Window, opposne
the door, containing a table and seats for readers. _ There are
carved oak buffets of ancient date, ponderous chairs, and stlll
more ponderous tables, one of which is said to contain as

many pieces as there are days in the year. Dingy-looking
portraits of eminent Lancashire divines stare at you from the
walls ; but the left-hand wall contains alone the benevolent pre-
sentment of Humphrey Chetham, the large-hearted, clear-
headed founder. Its place is over the wide chimney-piece,
which holds an ample grate ; and on either hand it is ﬂanked
by the carved efﬁgy of a bird, the one a pelican feeding its
young brood with its own blood, the other a cock, which is
said (and truly) to crow when it smells roast beef.
But we smell the feolfees’ dinner, and must not delay the
progress of Jabez and his friends. A large body of feoffees
were present, many in the uniforms of their special volunteer
' regiments. \
“ So this is the little fellow who was picked up asleep in a
cradle during the ﬂood of August, 1799,” observed rather
than inquired one of the gentlemen, who appeared as
spokesman. .
“ Yoi, yo’r honours,” answered Simon, making a sort of bow.
“ Who can bear witness to that? "
“Aw con ”-—“ An’ aw con,” responded Simon and Matt
Cooper in a breath. “ It wur uz as got him eawt 0’ th’
wayter.”
“ Anyone else?”
Bessy stepped forward modestly. ‘
“He wur put i’ moi arms on Tanners’ Bridge, an’ aw’ve
browt him oop iver sin’.”
“ Have you never sought for his parents P”
“ Ay, mony a time. Matt an’ me have spent mony a day i’
seekin’ ’em,” said Simon promptly, “ an’ we could fand no
moore than that papper tells ”——referring to a sheet in the
questioning feoffee’s hand.
“ Then how do you date the boy’s age with such precision?”
The nurse now sidled conﬁdently to the front.
“If it please your honour’s worship, aw wur called to stiff-
backed Nan’s dowter in the last pinch, when hoo wur loike to
die, an’ that little chap wur born afore aw left, an’ that wur 0’
th’ ﬁfth 0’ May, seventeen hunderd an’ noinety-noine. Aw
know it, fur aw broke mi arm th’ varry next day.”
“ And the mother died.”
“ Yea l—afore the week wur eawt.” _
“ And you think she was lawfully married? Where was her
husband?”
“Ay! that’s it! H00 had aguinea-goold weddin-ring on;

“ And you think they were honest, industrious people?”
“Ay, that they were, but rayther stiff i’ th’ joints, yo’ know

mebbe we’d ha’ known th’ lad’s neame an’ o’ belongin’ to him.

Jabez was called forward and examined, and he came pretty
well out of the ﬁre. They found that he could read a little,
knew part of his catechism, and they saw that he was a well-
behaved, intelligent boy, with truthful dark grey eyes and a
reflective brow.
There was a long and animated discussion, during which the
boy and his friends were bidden to retire. It was contended
that the marriage of the boy’s parents was not proven—that
his very name was dubious,——and that the founder’s will was
speciﬁc on that head.
Then one of Mrs. Clough’s friends rose and grew eloquent.
He asked if they were to interpret the will of the great and
benevolent man, whose portrait looked down upon them, by
the spirit or by the letter? If they themselves did not feel
that the boy was eligible, as the nurse’s testimony went to
prove? That this was a case peculiarly marked out for their
charitable construction. And he wound up by inquiring if they
thought Humphrey Chetham would expect his representatives
to be less humane, less charitable, less conscientious in dealing
with a bounty not their own, than that poor-struggling, hardwork-
ing tanner and his daughter, who had maintained and chqished
the orphan in spite of cruelly hard times, and still more cruel
slander. And then he told, as an episode, what Sally cooper
had confessed, and how and why Bess had lost her IOVer.
This turned the quivering scale. “ Jabez Clegg and his
friends” were called in ; the verdict which changed the current
of his life, was pronounced—Jabez Clegg was a Blue-coat
bo ! '
3Before the night was out, while the ﬂood-gates of all their
hearts were open, Matthew Cooper, though nearly twenty years
her senior, asked Bess to be his wife !

CHAPTER THE NINTH.
THE SNAKE.
OWEVER ambitious either Jabez or his kind fosterers
had been to see him a Blue-coat boy, the parting
between them was a terrible wrench. They were to him all
the friends or parents he had ever known.
Then there were his playmates in the yard, with liberty to
run in and out at will; and lastly, there were his dumb pets—
his kitten (grown to a cat), his pigeons, and the lame linnet,
hopping from perch to ﬁnger, and paying him for his love with
the sweetest of songs.
He was not more stunned by the noise and Easter Monday
bustle in the College Yard, or more awed by the imposing
presence of Governor Terry and the feoﬂ'ees, than by the mag-
nitude, order, and antique grandeur of the building henceforth
to be his home. Nevertheless, wide open as the gates were
for the day, he felt that they would close, and shut him in
among the cold strong walls and strangers, never to see his
pets or his loving friends again until Whitsuntide should bring
another holiday.
They older, more experienced, with a better knowledge of
all the boy would gain—all the pn'vation and premature labour
he would escape felt only how dull their humble home would
be without the willing feet and hands, the smiling face, and the
_cheerful voice of the sturdy little fellow who for more than
seven years had been as their own child.
He had given his last charge respecting his furry and
feathered brood, exchanged the last clinging embrace under
the dark arch, then tore away in quest of a deserted corner,
where he might hide the tears he could not wholly restrain.
At ﬁrst the new dress of which he was so proud, the blue
stockings and clasped shoes in place of clogs, the yellow baize

petticoat, the long-skirted blue overcoat or gown, the blue
mufﬁn-cap, the white clerical band at the throat (all neat, and
fresh, and unpatched as they were), felt awkward and uncom-
fortable—the long petticoat especially incommoded him. But
in a few days this wore off. There were other lads equally
strange and unaccustomed to robes and rules. Fellow-feeling
drew them towards each other, and with the wonderful adapta-
bility of childhood, they fell into the regular grooves, and were
as much at home as the eldest there in less than a fortnight.
And from the Chetham Gallery in the Old Church he could
see and be seen by Simon and Bess on Sabbath mornings
from the free seats in the aisle, and that contented them.
The training and education of the Chetham College boys
was, and is, conducted on principles best adapted for boys
expected to ﬁght their own way upwards in the world. They
were not cumbered with a number of “ologies” and “isms”
(the highest education did not stand on a par then with the
moderate ones of this day); their range of books and studies
was limited. Reading, writing, and arithmetic, sound and
practical information, alone were imparted, so much as was
needed to ﬁt the dullest for an ordinary tradesman, and supply
the persevering and intelligent with a fulcrum and a lever.
Nor did their education end with their lessons in the school-
room, nor was it drawn from books and slates alone.
Their meals were regular, their diet pure and ample, but
plain. They rose at six, began the day with prayer, and
retired to rest at eight. Besides their duties in the school-
room, they darned their own stockings, made their own beds,
helped the servants to keep their rooms clean, and six of the
elder boys were set apart to run errands and carry messages
beyond the precincts of the College.
Strength of muscle and limb were gained in the open
courtyard in such games as trap and football; patience and
ingenuity had scope in the bead purses, the carved apple-
scoops and marrow-spoons, the worsted balls and pincushions
they made to ﬁll their leisure hours indoors. There was no
idleness. Their very play had its purpose.
Let us set Jabez Clegg under the kind guardianship of
Christopher Terry, the governor, and under the direct super-
vision of the Reverend John Gresswell, the schoolmaster, to
con his Mavor, and make pothooks-and-ladles, on a form in
the large school-room at the west end of the College; and to
rise, step by step, up the ﬁrst difﬁcult rungs of that long ladder

of learning which may indeed rest on our common earth, but
which reaches far above the clouds and human ken.
Christmas and Midsummer vacations came and went, so did
those red-letter days of his College life, Easter and Whitsun-
tide, when he was free to rush to the old yard, so near at hand,
and after hugging Bess and Simon, whom he astonished with
his learning, could assure himself his dumb family had been
well cared for.
And if those passing seasons traced deeper lines on Simon’s
brow, gave more womanly solidity to Bess’s form and character,
they brought no change the foundling could mark. Tom
Hulme’s whereabouts was still undiscovered. Matt Cooper
was still a widower. But they and his masters could note the
steady progress he made, and his chivalrous love of truth and
sense of honour shown in many ways in little things. Yet
there was one event a grief to him. His little brown linnet
pined for its young friend, and died before the ﬁrst Whitsun-
day came.
He was not much over ten years old when he was proved to
possess courage, as well as truth and honour.
For some time Nancy, the cook, had observed that the
cream was skimmed surreptitiously from the milk-pans in the
dairy, that the milk itself was regularly abstracted, and she was
loud in complaint. She could scarcely ﬁnd cream enough to
set on the governor’s table, and servants and schoolboys were
in turn accused of being the depredators.
Complaints were made to Mr. Terry ; servants and boys
were alike interrogated and watched, and punished on sus-
picion ; but nothing could be proved, and no precautions could
save the milk. The lofty and spacious kitchen had its entrance
almost under the porch, and close beside it was a ﬂight of
stone steps leading to the dairy, a cellar below the kitchen, lit
by a small window high up on the side towards the river, and
of course opposite to the steps.
Stones tables occupied the two other sides, on which were
ranged a number of wide shallow pans of good milk. In the
extreme comer at right angles with the door at the head of the
stairs was another entrance, a small open door in a Gothic
frame, which opened on another and shorter ﬂight of steps, cut
in the rock and washed by the river, which sometimes rose and
beat against the cellar-door for admission, beat so oft and im-
portunately as to wear away the oak where it met the ﬂoor.
It was nearly breakfast time. Long rows of wooden bowls

and trenchers were ranged on the white kitchen-table. The
oatmeal porridge was ready to pour out. The cook ran short
of milk. Through a window overlooking the yard she espied
Jabez, whip in hand, driving a biped team of play-horses.
“Jabez, Jabez ,Clegg!” she called out at the pitch of her
voice, “come hither.”
Down went the reins, and the prancing steeds proceeded
without a driver. .
“ Fetch a can of milk from the cellar, Jabez ; an’ look sharp.
An’ see as yo’ dunna drink none l”
“ I never do,” said Jabez, not overpleased at the imputation.
“ Well, see as yo’ don’t, for some "on yo’ do.”
Iabez took the bright tin can, without putting down the
whip, and descended the unguarded cellar-stairs, whistling as
he went. He gave a jump down the last few steps, and to his
utter surprise, I cannot say dismay, saw that he had disturbed
a great greenish-brown snake spotted with black, and having a
yellowish ring round its neck. It lay coiled on the stone table
opposite to him, and with its head elevated above the rim of a
milk-pan was taking its morning draught, and in so doing
reckoning without its host.
“ Oh, you’re the thief, are you, Mr. Snake? It’s you’ve
robbed us of our milk, and got us boys thrashed for it l” cried
Jabez, without a thought a of danger, planting himself between
the culprit and the small postern door, as the snake, gliding
from the slab, turned hither for exit, putting out its forked
tongue and hissing at him as it came.
Without thought or consideration—without a cry of alarm
to those above, he struck at the threatening foe with his whip ;
and as the resentful snake darted at him, jumped nimbly aside,
and struck and struck again; and as the angry snake writhed
and twisted, and again and again darted its frightful head at him
with distended jaws, he whipped and whipped away as though
a top and not a formidable reptile had been before him.
Cook, out of patience, called “Jabez Clegg!” more than
once, in anything but satisfactory tones ,' and then, patience
exhausted, came to the top of the dairy-stairs. Then she
heard Jabez, as if addressing some one, say : “Oh, you would,
would you?” and the commotion having drawn her so far
down the steps that she could peer into the cellar and see what
was going on, she set up a prolonged scream. This was just
as Jabez, shifting the position of his whip, brought the butt-end
down on the head of the snake with all the force of his stout

young arm, and his exhausted foe dropped, literally whipped to
death. -
The woman’s screams brought not only the governor and
the school-master, but Dr. Stone, the librarian, to the spot.
And there stood Jabez, all his prowess gone, with his back
towards them, his head down on his arms, which rested on
the sone slab, sobbing violently for the very life he had just
destroyed.
"Oh, he’s bin bitten——he’s been bitten! The vemonous
thing’s bitten the lad! He’ll die after it l” cried the cook in
an ecstacy of terror.
“Stand aside, Nancy,” said Dr. Stone; “that snake is not
venomous. If I mistake not, the brave boy’s heart is wounded,
not his skin.”
And, coming down, the kind, discerning librarian lifted the
snake with the one hand, and took hold of Jabez with the
other, simply saying to him—
“Come into the governor’s room, Jabez, and tell us all
about it.”
And Jabez, drying his red eyes on the cuff of his coat, was
ushered before the Doctor up the stairs, and into the governor’s
room, where breakfast was laid for the three gentlemen. There
be brieﬂy told how he had found the snake drinking the milk ;
and having intercepted the reptile’s retreat, had been obliged,
in self-defence, to ﬁght with it until he had whipped it to death
——a consummation as unlooked for as regreted.
He had not, as at ﬁrst surmised, escaped unwounded in the
contest; but, as Dr. Stone had said, and the surgene who
dressed the bites conﬁrmed, the terrible-looking reptile was but
the common ringed-snake, which takes freely to the water ; and
its bite was harmless. From the dais in the refectory both
snake and whip were exhibited to the boys after breakfast.
“My lads,” said the governor, “I daresay you will all be
glad to know that the thief who stole the milk has been
taken.”
There was a general shout of assent, with here and there a
wondering glance at the vacant seat of Jabez, who, having his
wounds washed and bound up, had not sat down with them,
but had a sort of complimentary breakfast with the servants in
the kitchen.
“ And I daresay you would like to see the thief, and know
how he was caught.” - '
There was another general “ Ay, ay, sir i”


## p. 61 (#69) ##############################################

The Manchester Man. 62'
“Well, here he is,” (and he held the snake aloft); “but I
don’t think any of you will be thrashed on his account again.
Jabez Clegg, here” (and he pulled the reluctant boy forward
by the shoulder), “caught the sly robber drinking the milk,
and, with nothing but this whip and a fearless resolute arm, put
a stop to his depredations, and restored the lost character of
the school.” -
There was a loud hurrah for Jabez Clegg, who, for the time
being was a hero. Then, the snake being carried to the school-
room, the Rev. John Gresswell improved the occasion by a
lesson on snakes in general, and that one in particular. But
when he dissipated the popular belief that all snakes were
venomous, and assured the boys that the bite of this was
innocuous, more than one of the Blue-coated lads thought
Jabez was not such a hero after all. ~
The heads of the College thought otherwise. The snake,
and whip also, were placed high up against a wall in the College
museum, close beside the “ woman’s clog which was split by a
thunderbolt, and hoo wasn’t hurt.” They made part of the
catalogue of the Bluecoat guides—nay, even Jabez may have
run the rapid chronicle from the reel himself ; but the pain and
shock of having wilfully killed a living creature neutralised and
prevented the harm which might have followed self-glori-
ﬁcation.
The long unknown secret spoiler of the dairy had been such
a blemish on the spotless character of the Chetham Hospital—
such a scandal in its little world—that its capture became of
sufﬁcient importance for Dr. Thomas Stone to communicate to
the Reverend Joshua Brookes on his next visit to the library,
Jabez being considered a sort of protege of his.
Before the day was out the parson found his cough trouble-
some, and of course went to Mrs. Clowes for horehound-drops.
“ Well, what do you think of young Cheat-the-ﬁshes now P ”
came raspily from his lips, as he leaned on the counter, evi-
dently prepared for a gossip, shop-chairs being unheard-of
superﬂuities in those days.
Mrs. Clowes knew perfectly well whom the parson meant by
“ young Cheat-the-ﬁshes” ; indeed, the boy, on his rare holi-
days, had been a customer, as were the boys of College and
Grammar School generally.
“ Now ! Why, what’s th’ lad been doing? Naught wrong,
I reckon?”
You see she had faith in the boy’s open countenance.

“ Humph l that’s as folk think,” he growled, keeping his own
opinion to himself. “ I don’t suppose I need to tell you the
hubbub there’s been over there ” (jerking his ﬁnger in the
direction of the College) “ about the stolen milk P That tale’s
old enough.”
Mrs. Clowes nodded her mob-cap in assent.
“ Well, that lad Jabez found a snake, four feet long, with its
head in the milk pans the other morning. The sly thief turned
spiteful, and the two had a battle-royal all to themselves in the
cellar. The pugnacious rapscallion had a whip in his hand, .
and he—-—lashed the snake to death l” "
Mrs. Clowes echoed his last words, and uplifted her hands 7
in amazement. A snake was a terrible reptile to her. '
“ Ah ! and then blubbered like acry-a~babby because he had '
killed it ! What do you think of that, Dame Clowes P”
“ Eh ! I think he was a brave little chap to face a sarpent,
but I think a ﬁne sight more of his blubbering, as you call it,”
said she, taking a tin canister from a shelf, and putting it on
the counter with an emphatic bounce.
“ Ah ! I thought I could match the young fool with an old
one,” said he derisively, to hide his own satisfaction, as he took
his short legs to the door.
But Mrs. Clowes called him back, put a large paper parcel in
his hand, and said,
“ Here, Jotty, see you give these sweetmeats to your cry-a-
babby, and tell him an old woman says there’s no harm in
ﬁghting in self-defence with any kind of a snake, or for his own
good name, or to protect the helpless ,' but, if he ﬁghts just to
show off his own bravery, he’s a coward. And you tell him
from me never to be ashamed of tears he has shed in repen-
tance for injury he may have done to any living thing. Now
see you tell him, parson; and maybe my preachment may be
worth more to him than my cakes and toffy, or your sermons.”
And she nodded her head till her cap-border ﬂapped like a
bird’s wings.
“ Ugh ! dame, you’ll be for wagging that tongue and mutch
of yours in my pulpit next,” said he, gruﬁiy.
But he delivered the parcel and the “ preachment ” both
faithfully, and, moreover, turned over his stores of old school
books for a Latin grammar, which he put into the hand of
Jabez, with a promise to instruct the boy in the language, if he
would like to learn.

out any special liking for the task, had to encroach upon his
playhours for a new study, under-rated by the pupil, over-rated
by the teacher.
Could Joshua Brookes have put mathematical instruments
within his reach, or given him pencils and colours, the boy’s
eyes would have sparkled, and study been a pleasure.

CHAPTER THE TENTH.
FIRST ANTAGONISM.
HE extensive oblong enclosure known as Ardwick Green,
situated at the south-eastern extremity of the town, on
the left-hand side of the highway to Stockport and London,
was in 1809 part of a suburban village, and from Piccadilly to a
blacksmith’s forge a little beyond Ardwick Bridge, ﬁelds and
hedges were interspersed with the newly-erected houses along
Bank Top.
The Green, studded here and there with tall poplars and
other trees, was fenced round with quite an army of stumpy
wooden posts some six feet apart, connected by squared iron
rods, a barrier against cattle only. A long, slightly serpentine
lake spread its shining waters from end to end within the soft
circlet of green; and this grassy belt served as a promenade
for the fashionable inhabitants. And there must have been
such in that village of Ardwick early in the century, as now,
for the one bell in the tiny turret of St. Thomas’s small plain
red-brick chapel, rang a fashionable congregation into its neat
pews, to listen to the well-toned organ and the devoutly-toned
voice of the perpetual curate, the Reverend R. Tweddle, if we
may credit an historian of the time.
Red-brick church, red-brick houses, hard and cold outside,
solid and roomy and comfortable within as Georgian architec-
ture ever was, overlooked green and pond, but, luckily, over-
looked them from a reasonable distance, and, moreover, did
not elbow each other too closely, but were individually set in
masses of foliage, which toned down the staring brickwork.
Time and smoke have done so more effectually since.
One of the best, and best-looking, of these houses, near the
church, was the one in which the delicate Mrs. Aspinall had
presided for a few brief years. An iron palisade, enclosing a
few shrubs and evergreens, separated it from the wide roadway, >

but behind the screen of brick ran a formal but extensive
garden and orchard, well-kept and well-stocked, with a ﬁsh-
pond as formal in the midst.
Fish-ponds encourage damp, and damp encourages frogs,
efts, and their kin. Here they abounded, and Master Laurence
had a sort of instinctive belief that they were created solely for
his sport and amusement. Mr. Aspinall, his father, immersed
in business during the day and occupied with friends at home
or abroad until late hours at night, saw very little of his son,
who was thus consigned to servants during those hours not spent,
or supposed to be'spent, at a preparatory school close at hand.
The boy was quick and intelligent, had his mother’s amber
curls and azure eyes, her delicate skin and brilliant colour, but
the handsome face had more of the father therein, and was too
unformed to brook description here.
What he might have been with other training is not to be
told, but, under the supposition that he inherited his mother’s
fragile constitution, he had been woefully spoiled and pampered.
Opposition to his will was forbidden.
“Bear with him, Kitty, for my sake, and do not thwart him,
or you will break his ﬁne spirit,” had been Mrs. Aspinall’s
dying charge to her 0 d nurse 3 and as every demonstration of
temper was ascribed by both parents to this same “ ﬁne spirit,”
what wonder that he grew up masterful—and worse ?
His imperious disposition early ingratiated him into the
favour of Bob, his father’s groom ; and this man, thinking ‘no
evil, ignorantly sowed the seeds of cruelty in his young heart.‘
When the horses were singed, the boy was allowed to be a
spectator; if a whelp had its ears cropped, or the end of its tail
bitten off, he was treated to a sight. If a brood of kittens or a
litter of puppies had to be drowned, Master Laurence was sure
to be in at the death. He was taken to surreptitious cock-
ﬁghts and rat-hunts ; and though, when too late, Mr. Aspinall
turned the man away for inclining his son to “low pursuits,”
nothing was said or done to counteract these lessons of cruelty !
No wonder, then, that , to him the sight of pain inﬂicted
brought pleasure, or that inhumanity went hand-in-hand with
self-will.
One incident—a real one—will sufﬁce to show what Laurence
Aspinall was, when Jabez Clegg shed tears over the snake he
had killed perforce.
Kitty was in the kitchen alone. The maids were in other
parts of the house. She was sitting close to a blazing ﬁre on

account of her “ rheumatics,” and was in a doze. The even-
ing was drawing in. Master Laurence, coming direct from the
garden and the ﬁsh-pond, burst open the kitchen door with a
whoop which made Kitty start from her nap in a fright.
Thereupon he set up a loud laugh as the poor old woman held
her hand to her side, and panted for breath. In his hand was
his pocket-handkerchief, tied like a bundle, in which something
‘ living seemed to move and palpitate. They were young frogs
in various stages of development.
“Now, Kitty,” said he, “I’ll show you some rare-sport l”
and taking one of the live frogs out of the handkerchief deli-
berately threw it into the midst of the glowing ﬁre,
“There, Kitty; did you hear that F ” cried he in rapture,
as the poor animal uttered a cry of agony almost human,
whilst he danced on the hearth like a frantic savage round a
sacriﬁcial ﬁre.
“Oh, Master Laurence ! Master Laurence! don’t do that
-—don’t be so cruel ! ” appealed Kitty, piteously.
But he had drawn another forth, and crying, “ Cruel! It’s
fun, Kitty—fun!” tore it limb from limb, and threw it piece-
meal into the blaze.
“There’s another! and there’s another!” he shouted in
glee, as the rest followed in swift succession ; and Kitty,
shrieking in pain and horror, ran from the kitchen, bringing
the cook and housemaid downstairs with her cries.
For the ﬁrst time in his life Mr. Aspinall administered a
sound castigation to his son, regretting that he had not done it
earlier.
No more was said of his son’s ﬁne spirit; but, prompt to
act, he lost no time in seeking his admission into the Free
Grammar School ; and either to spare him the long daily walk
in tenderness for his health (Ardwick was more than a mile
away), or to place him under strict supervision, boarded
Laurence with one of the masters.
Yet he gave that master no clue to his son’s besetting sin;
so he was left free to tantalise and torment every weaker
creature within his orbit, from the schoolmaster’s cat, which he
shod with walnut-shells, to the youngest school-boy, whose
books he tore and hid, whose hair he pulled, whose cap and
frills he soused in the mud. V ,,
It was a misfortune for himself and others that his pocket
money was more abundant than that of his fellows. Never
had the apple-woman or Mrs. Clowes a more lavish customer,

or one who distributed his purchases more freely. Boys in-
capable of discriminating between generosity and profusion
dubbed him’ generous; and that, coupled with his handsome
face and spirited bearing which they mistook for courage,
brought him partisans.
I Thus, long before his ﬁrst year expired, and he was drafted
from the lower school to the room above, where he came
under the keen eye and heavy ferule of Joshua Brookes, he
had a body of lads at his beck (many older than himself),
ready for any mischief he might propose.
As may well be supposed, there was a natural antagonism
between the boys of the Grammar School and of Chetham’s
Hospital. As at the confluence of two streams the waters
chafe and foam and fret each other, so it is scarcely possible
for two separate communities, similar, yet differing in their
constitutions, to have their gateways close together at right
angles without frequent collision between the rival bodies.
In the great gate of the College, only open on special occa-
sions, was a small door or wicket, for ordinary use ,- and some
of the Grammar School boys, under pretence of shortening
their route homeward, ﬁnding it open, would make free to cross
the College Yard at a noisy canter, and let themselves out
at the far gate on Hunt’s Bank. It was aclear trespass. They
were frequently admonished by one ofﬁcial or another ; their
passage was disputed by the Blue-coat boys ; but they persisted
in setting up a right of road, and opposition only gave piquancy
to their bravado.
That which began with individual assumption soon attained
the character of boldly-asserted party aggression, and, as the
Blue-coat boys were as determined to preserve their rights as
the others were to invade them, many and well-contested were
the consequent ﬁghts and struggles. And thus the two boys,
Jabez Clegg and Laurence Aspinall, brought together ﬁrst at
the church door and the baptismal font, came into collision
again. But now there was no deferential stepping aside of the
humble foundling to make way for the merchant’s son. They
stood upon neutral ground, strangers to each other, equal in
their respective participation in the beneﬁts of a charitable
foundation. Nay, if anything, Jabez had the higher stand-
point. His orphanhood and poverty had given him a right to
his position in Humphrey Chetham’s Hospital; the very wealth
of the gentleman’s son made Laurence little better than a
usurper in Hugh Oldham’s Grammar School.
I r z

But it is no part of the novelist’s province to prate of the
use or abuse of charitable institutions, or to set class in opposi-
tion against class. It is only individual character and action
as they bear upon one another with which we have to deal.
On more than one Occasion jabez—since his conquest of
the snake, the recognised champion of his form—had stopped
Laurence Aspinall at the head of a ﬁle of boys, and had done
his best to bar their passage through the quadrangle.
Success depended on which school was ﬁrst released.
If in time, Jabez planted himself by the little wicket with
one or two companions, and, like Leonidas at Thermopylae,
fought bravely for possession of the pass, and generally con-
trived to beat off the intruders. Sometimes the Blue-coat boys
made a sortie from the yard, and, falling upon the others pell-
mell, left and bore away marks of the contest in swollen lips
and black eyes.
At length matters were brought to a crisis. Thrice had
Laurence and his clique been repulsed, and the shame of their
defeat heightened by derisive shouts from a tribe of Millgate
urchins—“Yer’s th’ Grammar Skoo’ lads beat by th’ yaller
petticoats agen !” “Yaller petticoats fur iver!” “ College
boys agen Skoo’ ! Hoorray !”
Master Laurence might have ground his teeth, and harangued
his followers, without obtaining an additional recruit, or spur-
ring them to a fresh attempt, but for the taunts of the rabble.
But the ignominy of defeat by petticoated College boys was too
much for the blood of the Grammar School, and youngsters
threw himself into the party quarrel who had hitherto stood
aloof.
Laurence Aspinall was superseded. A big, raw-boned fellow
named Travis, took the lead, and rallied round him not only
the lads from the lower school, but the bulk of the juniors in
the upper room. It is only fair to add that the senior students
were in no wise cognisant of the league, or, being so, carefully
shut their eyes and ears. _
As the result of this organism, on a set day, towards the close
of October, when the dusk gathered as the school dispersed,
the boys who ran down the wide steps from the upper, and
the juveniles who ran up from the lower room, instead of dart-
ing forward with a “Whoop!” and “Halloo ! ” through the
iron gate on their homeward way, clustered together within the
school-yard, and made way for seniors and masters to pass out
before them.

“Get off home with you, and don’t loiter there!” cried
Joshua Brookes, as he turned in at his own gate, and saw the
crowd massing together in the outer playground.
“Get home yourself, St. Crispin l” shouted Laurence, but
not before the house door had closed upon the irascible
master.
All books and slates not purposely left in school were con-
signed to three or four of the smallest boys, duly instructed to
carry them to Hunt’s Bank in readiness for their owners.
For a week or more the College boys had been unmolested ;
not a forbidden foot had stepped within the wicket. The
school-master had remarked to the governor, in the presence
of his pupils, that he thought Dr. Smith must have prohibited
further intrusion.
All the greater was the surprise that dusky October after-
noon when a troop of young rufﬁans, who had stolen quietly
one by one through the wicket, and kept under the cavernous
shade of the deep gateway until all were within, rushed, with
vociferous shouts, from under cover, and tore across the large
yard in the direction of the other gate, daring anyone to check
them. -
The College boys, just emerging from their school-room
door in the corner, were, for the moment, taken aback. Then,
from the mouth of Joshua Brookes’s new Latin scholar, rang,
clear and distinct, Humphrey Chetham’s motto—“ Quod tuum
tene!” (What you have, hold 1) and the Blue—coat boys, with
one George Pilkington for their leader, threw themselves, at
that rallying cry, like a great wave, headlong upon the
intruders.
They met the shock as a rock meets a wave, and down
went many a gallant Blue-coat in the dust. Up they were in
an instant, face to face with the besiegers ; and then, each
singling out an opponent, fought or wrestled for the mastery
with all the courage and animosity, if not the skill, of practised
combatants. Ben Travis and George Pilkington fought hand
to hand, and Jabez—not for the ﬁrst time—measured his
strength with Laurence.
Heavier, stronger, older by a few months, Iabez might have
overmatched his antagonist; but Laurence had proﬁted by the
lessons of Bob the discarded groom, and every blow was
planted skilfully, and told. Then Bob’s teaching had been
none of the most chivalrous, and Laurence took unfair
advantages. He “ struck below the belt,” and then tripping

Jabez up, like the coward that he was, kicked him as he lay
prostrate with the fury of a savage.
Governor, schoolmaster, librarian, and porter had hastened
to the scene ; but the assailants nearly doubled the number of
the College boys, and set lawful authority at deﬁance, hurling
at them epithets such as only schoolboys could devise.
Fortunately, their own Blue-coat boys were amenable to
discipline, and, called off, one by one, retreated to the house,
often with pursuers close at their heels. Then the Grammar
School tribe set up a scomful, triumphant shout, and, with
Ben Travis and Laurence Aspinall at their head, marched out
. of the College Yard at the Hunt’s Bank gate, exulting in their
victory, even though they left one of 'their bravest little antago-
nists insensible behind them.

CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.
THE BLUE-COAT BOY.
HOSE were rough days, when an occasional brawl was
supposed essential to test the mettle of man or boy, so
that bruises and black eyes (the result of an encounter for the
honour of the school) were passed over with much lighter
penalties than would be dealt out now-a-days, if young gentle-
men in a public academy descended to blackguardism.
At that time, too, the pupils of the Grammar School assem-
bled at seven in the morning, and sure punishment awaited the
laggard who failed to present himself for prayers. There were
few loiterers on that drear October morning. Conscience, and
perhaps a dread of consequences, had kept the preceding day’s
war-party sufﬁciently awake even where sore limbs did not.
But, with the exception of a few smart raps with the ferule, to
warm cold ﬁngers, and a general admonition~little heeded—
the early hours of the morning passed quietly enough, and
whispers ran along classes, and from form to form, more con-
gratulatory than prophetic.
_ That day went by, and the next. Laurence Aspinall, whose
“ science ” had saved his head from more damage than a cut
lip, was especially boastful, and, after his own underhand
fashion, strove to stir big Ben Travis to fresh demonstrations.
Then a cloud loomed in the horizon, and darkened every ._
master’s brow. Another whisper was in circulation that '
Governor Terry had been seen to enter the head-master’s '
ancient black and white old house, and had been closeted with
Dr. Smith for more than an hour. Still the quiet was un-
broken, and, to the wise, the very calm was ominous.
The second of November brought a revelation. On the
slightly-raised floor of the high school, at the Millgate end of
the room, sat, not only Dr. Jeremiah Smith, but the trustees of
the school, the _Reverend Joshua Brookes, and the assistant

masters ; and with them was Governor Terry, of the Chetham
Hospital—all grave and stem. Dr. Smith’s mild face was
unusually severe, and Joshua’s shaggy brows lowered menac-
ingly over his angry eyes, The senior pupils, chieﬂy young
men preparing for college, were ranged on either side. .
As the last of these awful personages ﬁled in through the
two-leaved door, and took his place, the palpitating hearts of
the delinquents beat audibly, and courage oozed from many a
clammy palm.
The boys were summoned from the lower school, and one by
one, name by name, Ben Travis and his followers were called
to take their stand before this formidable tribunal, Laurence
Aspinall shrinking edgeways, as if to screen himself from
observation.
There was little need for Dr. Smith to strike his ferule on the
table to command attention, silence was so profound. Even
nervous feet forgot to shufﬂe. Dr. Smith’s commanding eye
swept the trembling rank from end to end, as he stood with im-
pressive dignity to address them.
After a brief exordium, in which he recounted the several
charges brought against the boys by Governor Terry, he
proceeded to say that the good character of the Manchester
Grammar School was imperilled by lawless conduct such as
the boys before him had exhibited the previous Tuesday, in
forcibly entering, and then rioting within, the College Yard.
One of the youths—most likely Ben Travis—blurted forth
that they had a right to go through the College Yard, and that
the College boys stopped them.
“You mistake,” said the doctor, stemly, “there is no public
right of road through the College Yard. Permission is cour-
teously granted, but there is no right. There is a right for the
public to pass to and from the College and its library on busi-
ness, within the hours the gates are open ; but even that must
be in order and decency. Your conduct was that of barbarians,
not gentlemen.”
At this point of the proceedings Jabez Clegg came into the
school-room, leaning on the arm of George Pilkington. The
face of the latter was bruised and swollen, but Jabez looked
deplorable. His long overcoat was rent in more than one
place 5 he walked with a limp : a White bandage round his head
made his white face whiter still, showing more distinctly the
livid and discoloured patches under the half-closed eyes. In
obedience to a. nod from Governor Terry, George Pilkington

The Mmze/Zesler Man. 73
led his Blue-coat brother to a seat beside him ; but Dr. Smith,
drawing the boy gently to his side, removed the bandage, and
showed Jabez to the school with one deeply-cut eyebrow
plastered up.
“ What boy among you has been guilty of this outrage?” he
asked, sternly.
There was no answer. Some of the little ones took out their
handkerchiefs and began to whimper, fearing condign punish-
ment. The doctor repeated his question. The boys looked
from one to another, but there was still no reply. Laurence
Aspinall edged farther behind his coadjutor, but he had not [the
manliness either to confess or regret. His only fear was detec-
tion, or betrayal by a traitor. There was little fear of that;
grammar-school boys have a detestation of a “ sneak.”
“Boys, we cannot permit the perpetrator of such an outrage
to remain in your midst ; he must be expelled 1 ”
Still no one spoke.
“ Do you think you could recognise your assailant—the boy
who kicked you after you were down ? ” (a murmur ran round
the school as the classes were ordered to deﬁle slowly past Dr.
Smith’s desk).
Ben Travis walked with head erect—he would have scorned
such a deed—and Laurence tried to do the same, but his
cruel blue eyes could not meet those of his possible accuser.
There was a struggle going on in the heart of Jabez. It was
in his power to revenge himself for many taunts and sarcasms,
and much previous abuse. He-called to mind—for thought is
swift—that Shrove Tuesday when Laurence and his friends
caught him as he descended Mrs. Clowes’s steps with a penny-
worth of humbugs in his hand, and snatching his cap from his
head, kicked it about Half Street and the churchyard as a foot-
ball. And he seemed to feel again the twitch at his dark hair
and the dreadful pain in his spine and loins, as they bent him
backwards over the coping of the low wall, in order to wrest
his sweets from him, and held him there perforce till stout
Mrs. Clowes, armed with a rolling-pin, came to his rescue, lay-
ing about . her vigorously, and kept him in her back parlour
until he revived.
“Forgive and forget ” are words for the angels, and Jabez
was not an angel, but a boy with quick beating pulses, and a
vivid memory. There was a ﬁght going on in his breast ﬁercer
then either that in Half Street or that in the College Yard. His
sore, stiff limbs and smarting brow urged him like voices to

“ pay him off for all,” and revenge began to have a sweet savour
in his mouth.
As he hesitated, watching the slow approach of his foe
among his nobler mates, a harsh voice behind him called out
“ Jabez, why do you not answer Dr. Smith P ”
The emphasis Joshua Brookes had laid upon the “Jabez”
recalled the boy’s better self. The oft-repeated text ﬂashed
across his mind, “ Jabez was an honourable man,” and it
shaped his reply.
“Well, sir, it was almost dark, and—and ”—he was going to
add too dark to distinguish features, but he recollected that
that would be a falsehood, and lying was no more honourable
than malice.
“ And you could not recognise him, you mean?” suggested
Dr. Smith. _
His lip quivered.
“ No, sir, I do not mean that. It was very dark, but I
think I should know him again. But, oh! if you please, sir, I
should not like to turn him out of school. You see, we were
all ﬁghting together, and we were all in a passion, and—and—
it would be very mean of me to turn him out of school because
he hurt me in a ﬁght” (Jabez did not say a fair ﬁght).
“Ah 1 ” said Dr. Smith, and, turning to Mr. Terry asked,
“ Are all the Chetham lads reared on the same principle 2‘ ”
Then there was a low‘voiced discussion amongst trustees and
masters. Finally, Dr. Smith turned round. His clear eye had
detected the culprit as he winced beneath the gaze of jabez.
But the injured boy had forgiven, and it was not for him to
condemn.
Again he spoke—proclaimed how Jabez had magnanimously
declined to single out his cowardly antagonist; and that the
boy, whoever he might be, had to thank his most honourable
victim that he was not ignominiously expelled. Then quietly
but emphatically he pronounced the decision of the trustees
that instant expulsion should follow any or every repetition or
the offence which had called them together—not only the ex-
pulsion of the ringleaders, but of all concerned ; and that even
a fair ﬁght between a Grammar School, and a Blue-coat boy
should be visited with suspension pending enquiry, the offender
to be expelled whether from school or College. _
“Good lad, Jabez l—good lad !” said Joshua Brookes to
him, as George Pilkington helped his limping steps from the
room. '


## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################

The Manehestey Man. 75
On the broad ﬁat step outside the door they encountered
big Ben Travis, who caught the hand of Jabez in a rough grip,
with the exclamation, “Give us your ﬁst, my young buck!
You’ve more pluck in your ﬁnger than that carroty Aspinall in
his whole carcase, the mean cur ! An’ look you, my lad, if any
of them set on you again, I’ll stand by and see fair play; or
I’ll ﬁght for you if it’s a big chap, or my name’s not Ben
Travis.”
“Who talks of ﬁghting? Haven’t you had enough for one
while, you great raw-boned brute? You’d better keep your
ready ﬁsts in your pockets Travis, if you don’t want to be
kicked out of school!” After which gruff reminder Joshua
left them, and Jabez went back to the College with one more
friend in the world; but that friend was not Laurence
Aspinall.
He, smarting under a sense of obligation, shrunk away to
bite his nails and vent his spleen in private, conscious that
he was shunned by his classmates, and despised by honest Ben
Travis.
As months and seasons sped onwards, they plucked the
hairs from Simon Clegg’s crown, and left a bald patch to tell of
care or coming age; they stole the roundness from Bessy’s
ﬁgure, the hope from her heart and eyes. There was less
vigour in the beat of her batting-wand, less elasticity in her
.step. The periodical holidays and cheering visits of Iabez
were the only pleasant breaks in the monotonous life of the
Cleggs. Beyond the knowledge obtained at the billeting ofﬁce
in King Street that Tom Hulme had entered the army and
gone abroad with his regiment, no tidings of the self-exiled
soldier had come to them. In the great vortex of war his
name had been swallowed up and lost. But she never said
“Ay” to Matthew Cooper, though he waited and waited,
smoking his Sunday pipe by the ﬁreside even till his own
Molly was old enough to have a sweetheart, and to want to
leave her father’s crowded hearth for a quieter one of her
own.
Those same months and years added alike to the
stature and attainments of Jabez Clegg and Laurence
Aspinall, though in very unequal ratio. The former,
though he had long since astonished Simon with his
ﬂuent rendering of the big Bible, was but a. plodding '
scholar of average ability, the range of whose studies was
limited, notwithstanding Parson Joshua’s voluntary Latin

lessons. The latter had an aptitude for learning, which made
his masters press him forward ,' and Joshua Brookes forgave
the tricks he played, his translations were so clear and so
correct. Yet, when he wrote stinging couplets or “St. Cris-
pin ” on the Parson’s door, or put cobblers’-wax on the peda-
gogue’s chair, the covert reference to his parentage, stung the
irascible man more than the damage to kerseymere, and in his
wrath he birched his pupil into penitence.
His penitence took a peculiar form. A discovery was made
that a general dance in the school-room would shake the
pewter platters and crockery down from dresser and comer
cupboard in Joshua’s house adjoining. Whenever the dominie
had growled over bad lessons with least cause, Laurence was
sure to propose a grand hornpipe after school hours. Back
would rush Joshua fast as his short legs would carry him,
spluttering with passion; but the nimbler lads disappeared
when they heard the crash, and, as a rule Joshua’s temper
cooled before morning.
Laurence Aspinall’s chief source of amusement from his ﬁrst
entrance into the Grammar School had been the crippled
father of Joshua Brookes. As the old fellow staggered home
drunk, the street-boys would hoot at him, pull him about, pelt
him with mud, and mock at him, till his impotent fury found
vent in a storm of vile and opprobrious language. Laurence
was sure to enjoy a scene of this kind, but he was generally sly
enough to act as prompter, not as principal.
The old man was a great angler; and that he might enjoy
unmolested his favourite pastime, his son had obtained from
Colonel Hansom permission for him to ﬁsh in Strangeways
Park ponds. T hither he had an empty hogshead conveyed,
and the crippled old cobbler, with a ﬂask of rum for company,
sat within it, often the night through, to catch ﬁsh. The Irk
had not then lost its repute for ﬁne eels, and'old Brookes——
who, by the way, wore his hair in a pigtail—was likewise wont
to plant himself, with rod and line, on what was the Water-
worth Field, on the Irwell side of Irk Bridge, to catch eels.
Returning one afternoon (Joshua was busied with clerical
duties), Laurence Aspinall and his fellows met the old man
staggering along with his rod over his shoulder and a basket of
eels in one hand.
He had called at the “ Packhorse ” for a dram, and went on,
as was his wont, talking noisily to himself. He had steered
round the corner in safety 3 but hearing one lively voice call

out, " Here’s old Fishtail ;” and another, “ Here’s St. Crispin’s
Cripple ; ” and a third, “ Make wayIfor Diogenes,” as he was
passing the high-master’s ancient house he gave a lurch, meaning
to reprove them solemnly—the top of his rod caught in the promi-
nent pillar of the doorway, and was torn from his insecure grasp.
Striving to recover it, he pitched forward, and in falling
dropped his basket in the mud, and set the writhing, long-lived
ﬁsh at liberty to swim in the gutter swollen with recent rain.
The lounging lads at once set up a shout; but Laurence,
with a timely recollection that the front of Dr. Smith’s was
scarcely the most convenient place for his purpose, winked at
his companions, and, with an aspect of mock commiseration,
politely assisted the old man to rise, begged the others to
capture the eels and carry the basket for him, and, under pre-
tence of putting the angler’s rod in order, contrived to fasten
the hook to the end of his old-fashioned pigtail.
Then he helped his unsteady steps until they were fairly out
of Dr. Smith’s sight and hearing; but they did not suffer him
to reach his son’s house before they showed their true colours.
Loosing his hold, Laurence snatched at the rod, and, darting
with it towards the College gate, cried out in high glee, “ I’ve
been ﬁshing ,' look at the ﬁne snig (eel) I’ve caught 1 ” And,
as he capered about, he dragged the poor old cripple hither
and thither backwards by his pigtail, to which hook and line
were attached.
Old Brookes screamed in impotent rage and pain ; the
boys laughed and shouted the louder. The one with his hasket
set it on his head, and paraded about, crying, “ Who’ll buy my
snigs? Fine fresh snigs l” with the nasal drawl of a genuine
ﬁsh-seller.
Once or twice the old man fell down, uttering awful threats
and imprecations ; but Laurence only laughed the more, and
jerked him up again with a smart twitch of the line, which was
a strong one ; and the other three or four young rufﬁans put up
their shoulders, and limped about singing—
“ The ﬁshes drink water,
Old Crispin drinks gin ;
But the ﬁshes come out
When the hook he throws in.
T01 de rol.”
It may be wondered that none of the neighbours interfered.
But it must be remembered that they were accustomed, not

only to the uproar of a boyish multitude, but to the drunken
ravings of Old Brookes, who was an intolerable nuisance.
Public traffic then was not as now, and policemen were
unborn.
The satisfaction of Laurence was at its height. He kept
hold of the line; one of his comrades, named Barret, lashed
the persecuted man with an eel for a whip, and their mirth was
boisterous, when Jabez (now thirteen) came quietly through
the wicket on an errand from the governor.
He took in the scene at a glance. He could not stand by ,
and see injustice done. His dark eyes ﬂashed with indignation '1
as he dashed forward, pulling the line from the hand of i
Laurence, and tried to disentangle the cruel hook from the '
unfortunate pigtail.
“ Who asked you to interfere, you petticoated jackanapes P ”
bawled Laurence, darting forward, his face as red as his hair, at
the same time dealing Jabez a heavy blow on the chest.
“ My duty! ” answered Jabez, stoutly, taking no notice of
the sneer at himself. “ How could you gentlemen torment a
poor old cripple like that? ”
“ He’s a drunken old sot i” cried Barret.
“ It’s downright cruel I” continued Jabez, as he stood
between the jabbering drunkard and his tormentors.
“ We’re no more cruel than he is ! He’s been catching ﬁshes
all day. We’ve only given him a taste of his own hook; and
we’ll have none or your meddling !” and out went the pugilistic
arm of Laurence straight from the shoulder to deal another
blow, when it was caught from behind by the bony hand of
Ben Travis, bigger and stronger by two year’s growth, whilst
the other hand gripped his jacket collar. .
“So you’re at your cowardly tricks again, Aspinall 1” ex-
claimed he, holding the other as if in a vice. But if I see you
lay another ﬁnger on that lad, I’ll report you to Dr. Smith.”
“Oh! you’d turn sneak, would you?” sneered Laurence,
striving to twist himself loose, and disordering his broad white
frill in the endeavour.
“ I’d think I did the Grammar School a service to turn
either you or Barret out of it, I would ! Think of you setting
on that noble chap who wouldn’t turn tell-tale, though he’ll
carry the mark of your boot to his grave with him ! ”
Pointing with outstretched hand to Jabez, who by this time
was handing Old Brookes over to the grumbling care of
Tabitha, and whose right eyebrow yet showed a red seam,

Travis relaxed his hold of Laurence, and he shook himself
free.
Some warm altercation followed. There was a scowl of
sullen deﬁance on Aspinall’s face, and an evil glance towards
Jabez, which Travis observing, with a signiﬁcant nod he linked
his arm in that of the Blue-coat boy, and never left him till he
reached his destination, Mr. Hyde’s ancient and picturesque
tea-shop in Market-street Lane.

CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.
THE GENTLEMAN.
HAT afternoon a gentleman who had witnessed part- of
the foregoing scene from the breeches-maker’s window,
whither he had gone for a pair of buckskin riding-gloves—
struck by the dauntless manner of Jabez, related what he had
seen to his wife, Mrs. Ashton, the stately sister of Mrs. Chad—
wick; whilst Augusta, their eight-year old daughter, sat on a
footstool by her side, hemming a bandana handkerchief for her
father, an inveterate snuff-taker—occasionally putting in a word,
as only spoiled daughters did in those days.
“Mamma, I daresay that’s the little boy Cousin Ellen told
me about.”
“ Pooh, pooh ! Augusta,” said Mr. Ashton, tapping the lid
of his snuff-box, and then, from force of habit, handing it to
his wife, the wave of whose hand put it back—“ pooh, pooh 1
child. Do you think there’s only one Blue-coat boy in the
town? Besides, he was not such a little boy. I know I
thought something of myself when I was his size,” said Mr.
Ashton, dusting the snuff from his rufﬂes as he spoke.
“ But he would be a little boy when Ellen knew him ﬁrst.
She says it was before I was born.”
“ He could not be a Blue-coat boy then, my dear,” observed
Mrs. Ashton ; “ he was too young.”
“ But Ellen showed him to me when we went to the College
at Easter; and she says he has killed a snake—a real live
snake, papa. And Aunt Chadwick bought Ellen such a pretty
pincushion he had worked, and, oh! such a handsome bead
purse 1”
Mr. Ashton smiled at his daughter’s enthusiasm.
“Ah ! I think I have heard of him before; he is a sort of
protege of Parson Brookes.”
“He is a very honest boy,” appended Mrs. Ashton, as she

The Manchester Man. 81
examined Augusta’s hemming by the light of the nearest wax
candle. “ Ellen lost Prince William’s shilling that same day.
You know she always wears it dangling from her neck, absurd
as it is for a great girl of ﬁfteen.”
“ Well?” said Augusta, looking up inquiringly.
“ Well, my clear, the very next afternoon the boy Jabez Clegg
knocked at the door in Oldham Street with the shilling, which
he said he had found in sweeping the library, and remem-
bered seeing it on Miss Chadwick’s neck. Many a boy, at
Easter, would have spent it in cakes or toﬂ'y.”
“I suppose, to use one of your favourite maxims, he must
have thought ‘honesty the best policy,’ ” remarked her hus-
band. .
“Yes; and ‘duty its own reward ’—for he refused the half-
crown that Sarah offered him.”
Mr. Ashton took another pinch of snuff, with grave con-
sideration, then put the box, after some deliberation, into his
deep waistcoat pocket, and again ﬁapped the snuff off rufﬂes
and neck-cloth ends.
“ Wouldn’t take the money, you say P ”
“Would not take it,” his wife repeated, folding up the
ﬁnished handkerchief.
After a pause, Mr. Ashton said, with his head on one
side —'
“’I think I shall look after that younker. What is he
like P ”
“Oh, that I cannot tell; I was not with them. But I think
Sarah said he had got an ugly scar on one of his eyebrows.”
Mr. Ashton brought down his hand with a clap on that of
Augusta, resting on his knee. ’
“Then, my little Lancashire witch, the poor cripple’s cham-
pion and Ellen’s hero of romance will be one and the same.
I must certainly look after that lad.”
But even as Mr. Ashton came to that conclusion Jabez was
in mortal peril, and his romance and theirs threatened to end
at the beginning.
Laurence Aspinall was not of a temper to brook inter-
ference with his sport, or to be treated as the inferior of a
“ common charity boy.” Since the hour that Jabez' had
declined to single him out for punishment, he had resented
the sense of his own inferiority whi'ch conscience pressed upon
him. In refusing to tender either thanks or apology at Ben
Travis’s instigation, he lost caste in the school, and the know-

ledge rankled in his breast. Against the debt of gratitude he
owed to Jabez he laid up a fund of envy and spite, out of
which he meant to pay him in full the ﬁrst opportunity. That
opportunity had arrived. There were some birds of his own
feather, who stuck by him, of whom Ned Barret was one.
Old Brookes had been too drunk to swear positively who
had molested him, or to obtain credence if he did ; but the in-
opportune arrival of Jabez and Ben Travis had made detec-
tion certain, and nothing was Joshua Brookes so sure to punish
with severity as an attack on the father who made his life a
burden to him.
On the principle that they might “as well be hanged for a
sheep as a lamb,” the noble ﬁve resolved to waylay the Blue-
coat boy on his return, and either extract from him a promise
of secrecy, or give him a sound drubbing for his pains.
They were too like-minded for long conference. To put the
old breeches-maker off the scent, all dispersed but one, Kit
Townley, who pulled a top from his pocket and whipped away
at it with as much energy as ever did his Anglo-Saxon an~
cestors. Perhaps he thought he had a meddlesome College
boy under his lash.
After a time, the others sauntered back one by one, from
contrary directions ; there was more top-whipping, and some of
the whips and tops were new. Then when they saw they were
unobserved, they adjourned to the school~yard, and layiiig a
cap on the broad step, two or three of them sat down to a
game at cob-nut, so that if any unlikely straggler did come
that way there might be an apparent reason for their presence.
It was late in the year. The breeches-maker was seated at
his early tea, and so were most of his neighbours. The twi-
light was coming gently down, and the boys, tired of waiting
were about to go home to their own—Aspinall expecting a
reprimand for being late. Jabez, who had been delayed at the
ofﬁce of Harrop the printer in the Market Place, came briskly
up with a parcel in his hand just as they reached the gate.
One of them snatched the parcel from him and ran with it into
the school-yard. As a natural consequence Jabez followed to
regain his property.
That was just what they wanted. The light iron gate was
pushed-to, and there they were, shut in and screened from
observation, between the deserted Grammar School on the one
hand, and the College School-room on the other, which, with
the dormitory above, was equally sure to be empty at that hour.


## p. 83 (#93) ##############################################

They were free to torment him as they pleased. The parcel
was tossed from hand to hand with subdued glee, and their
whip-lashes and strung cob-nuts cut at his arms and shoulders,
as Jabez sprang forward and darted hither and thither, per-
plexed and bafﬂed in his efforts to recover it. Once or twice
it went doWn on the damp ground, and gained in grime what it
lost in shape. I
“ Oh ! dear, dear! do give me my parcel!” cried Iabez, in '
perplexity. “Our governor will think I’ve been loitering.”
“ And so you have, you canting yellow-skirt. You stopped
to put your long ﬁnger in our pie!” was the swift retort of
Laurence, as he interposed his body between Jabez and the ..
boy who held his lost charge. |
“Eh! and you went off with Travis, wasting your time!”
added Kit Townley.
“I never waste my time on an errand.”
“Oh ! Miss Nancy never wastes time on an errand.”
mimicked Ned Barret ; and still they kept the boy on the run
until he leaned, out of breath, against the wall which served as
a parapet above the river.
Then, the disputed prize being kept by Kit Townley at a
respectable distance, Laurence advanced to parley with him,
offering to restore his parcel and let him go if he would take a
solemn oath, which he dictated, to maintain silence on all
which had transpired that afternoon.
“ I cannot; I must account for my time,” ﬁrmly answered
Jabez, “ and I must account for that dirty parcel.”
“Tell them you tumbled down and hurt yourself,” suggested
Aspinall.
“ I cannot ; it would be untrue !” '
At this the lads set up a loud guﬂaw, as if truth were some—
what out of fashion; but the one who stood nearest the gate
with the parcel looked restless, as if beginning to be tired of
the whole business. Just then Laurence went blustering up
to the College boy, and, thrusting his face forward, said-—
“ If you don’t go down on your marrow-bones this instant,
and swear to tell no tales, we’ll pitch you over the wall.”
“ You dare not ! ” boldly retorted Jabez, with a set face.
“Oh! daren’t we? We’ll see that! Lend a hand.”
“No, you dare not!” repeated he, planting himself ﬁrmly
against the wall.
There was a sudden rush ; they closed round him, more in
bravado than with any intent to do him bodily harm: sliding

him up against the smooth-worn brick-work, they hoisted him
above their shoulders, meaning to hold him there. But in
their eagerness they had thrust him too far, and crowding on
each other, one, being jostled, let go, and Jabez toppled over
the precipice !
There was a scream ; a splash in the water. Tabitha, taking
clothes from a line in the back-yard, cried out, “What is
that?” Parson Brookes’s startled pigeons ﬂew from their
dove-cote, and wheeling round in widening circles cooed
affrightedly.
The white-faced boys stood aghast. Unless his fall had
been seen from the opposite croft, their victim would be
drowned before any aid they could bring was available ; a wide
circuit must be taken before a bridge could be reached!
Buildings blocked up that side of the river. They looked at
each other and spoke in whispers; then, with an animal instinct
of self-preservation, sneaked off in silence and terror, leaving
him to his fate.
Not all. Kit Townley, who held the parcel, had drawn
near to remonstrate. With a shriek he threw down the paper,
and, hardly conscious what he did, tore wildly through the
gates, and across the College Yard, to startle the ﬁrst he met
with the alarm that a College boy was drowning in the Irk!

CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.
SIMON’S PUPIL.
T was fortunate tor Jabez that the late rains had raised the 5
level of the Irk : otherwise, that being the shallowest
part of the stream, there would not have been sufﬁcient depth
of water to buoy him up when he was pitched over the wall ;
and had his head come in contact with rock or stone, falling
from such an elevation, his history would have closed with the
last chapter. It was doubly fortunate that sensible Simon had.
taught him that without which no boy’s education—nor, in-
deed, any girl’s either—is complete, and that Jabez, from very
love of the water, had kept himself in practice whenever a
holiday had given him opportunity.
He had gone over the wall backwards, falling into the stream
head downwards, but not altogether unprepared ,- and to him
head ﬁrst, heels ﬁrst, forward or backward, were all as one.
Like a cork he rose, and struck out across the river. The
slimy stone embankment seemed to slip from his touch ; there
was no hold for his hand ,' it was too steep and smooth to
climb ; and he felt that the river, swift in its fulness, was bent
on bearing him to the Irwell, so dangerously near.
He raised his voice for “ help.” Tabitha, listening,
answered with a scream and a shout, and, bolting into the
house, disturbed the Parson and his besotted father at their tea
by the outcry she made, as she rushed on into the street with
the alarm of “ a lad dreawndin,” just as the conscious culprits
slunk past to their own quarters.
DoctorStone, the ﬁrst recipient of terriﬁed Kit Townley’s
incoherent intelligence, was simultaneously racing at full speed,
with a troop of College boys at his heels, down towards Hunt’s
Bank and the outlet of the Irk, with the swift consciousness
that the only hope of saving life was in the chance of reaching

the conﬂuence of the rivers ﬁrst. He thought the dusk never
came down so rapidly. A lamplighter, with ladder and ﬂaring
long-spouted oil-can light, was going his rounds.
“ Turn back, my man, with ladder and light,” he called out,
without stopping ; and the man, seeing something unusual was
astir or amiss, followed at a canter without question.
At Irk Bridge the librarian took the light from the man, and
swung it to cast its reﬂection over the Irwell ; but nothing was
to be seen or heard but the full river, and the wash of its
waters. To cross the bridge, in fear that the boy was beyond
help, was but the work of a moment.
Slower, along the wooden railing of the Irk embankment, he
held the lamp low. There was neither eddy or bubble on the
water to tell where a drowning mortal had gone down.
“ Jabez ! Jabez Clegg! ” he cried, but there was no response.
Again and again he raised his voice—“ Jabez I Jabez 1” The
only answer was from an advancing crowd, with Parson
Brookes and Tabitha in their midst, who had rushed to the
rescue with ropes and poles down the bridge at Mill Brow.
“ I fear it’s no use, Parson Brookes,” said the librarian
sadly ; “the river’s high, and poor Jabez may have been drift-
ing past Stannyhurst before we were out of the College Yard.”
“Jabez l” exclaimed Joshua aghast, “ you cannot mean
that Jabez Clegg is the boy drowned ! ” and he staggered as if
some one had struck him. \
“ Indeed, Parson, if this boy speaks truth, I fear it is so,”
and he turned to question his informant ; but Kit Townley,
seeing his impulsive schoolmaster approach, had edged away,
and was gone.
Gruff Joshua drew the back of his hand across his shaggy
brows.
“And so the greedy river has swallowed the bright lad at
last! He was a boy of promise, Dr. Stone, and his untimely
fate is a—a—trouble to me 3 ” and the rough Parson’s harsh
voice shook with emotion. “ I baptised him, Doctor, and I
hoped to see him grow up a credit to us all.” .
They, and the dispersing crowd, seeing the uselessness of
longer stay, were moving on towards Mill Brow as he spoke.
“Who’s this?” he cried as they neared the bridge, and a
working woman, her hair ﬂying loose from the kerchief on her
head, rushed across it with an impetus gained in the steep
descent. .
It was Bess, with Simon at her heels, close as his stiff

rheumatic limbs would carry him. She wrung her hands
bitterly.
“Is it true?” she cried in anguish, “is it true? Oh, Par-
son Brucks, is it true that ar Jabez is dreawnded ? ”
There was the same choking in his voice as he answered—
“ I’m afraid so, Bess.”
Simon’s voice now broke in.
" But are yo’ sartain, Parson? Ar Jabez couldn swim loike
a duck. An’ how cam he i’ th’ wayther, aw shouldn loike to
know ? ” I
“ Swim, did you say?” interrogated Dr. Stone. “Then there
may be hope yet. If the eddies would not let him land at
Waterworth Field, he might swim ashore at Stannyhurst.”
“ Pray God it be so! ” ejaculated Bess, from a full heart.
Dr. Stone, hurrying forward, continued :
“ Follow me to the College for lanterns to renew the search.”
And no second invitation was needed.
And where was Jabez? He heard Tabitha’s cry, but it came
from the wrong side, and he had sense to know was useless to
save, unless he could withstand the current till help came
round. But the strong stream was bearing him on against
his will. Suddenly he bethought him of the dairy steps, and,
with a stroke of his left arm, swerved towards the hoary build-
ing looming through the twilight. One moment later, and the
steps had been passed, not to be recovered, for the current was
stronger than be; but that providentially abrupt turn, and a
few skilful strokes, brought him upon them. Literally upon
them, for the water was within a step or two of the door. With
difﬁculty he obtained a footing, they were so slippery. Once
above the water, he hammered at the door and called, but his
voice was weakened by exertion and the shivering consequent
on cold, wet, clinging garments. Again and again he knocked
and called, but everyone was out in the quadrangle, or away
in search of him, and no one heard.
He had been excited and over-heated in his prolonged
struggle with his persecutors, and, short as was the distance he
swam, his efforts to stem the overmastering current had ex-
hausted him. Cold and exposure did the rest. He sank on
the topmost step with his head against the door, in the angle it
formed with the wall, his feet in the water; and there he lay,
too faint to respond when Dr. Stone’s voice fell on h1_s ear as
on that of a dreamer. His dark robe, his position, the jutting
wall—all contributed to hide him from the poor rays of the

plne oil-lamp which was ﬂashed along the stream to ﬁnd
1m.
And there he might have lain and died had not Nancy,
for lack of a boy at hand to wait on her, gone down to the
cellar for milk for the boys’ supper. As she ﬁlled the
wooden piggin she had taken with her, she fancied she
heard a moan, and listening breathless, heard another, and
another, from the outside of a door which was (to her
thought) inaccessible to mortal.
Down went the piggin and the milk (she was not a
strong~minded woman, and it was a superstitious age), up
the steps she stumbled in her fright, crying—
“Oh! theer’s a boggart in th’ dairy l—theer’s a boggart!”
Dr. Stone and his companions came in at the porch as
she ﬂed upwards towards the kitchen. The ﬁrelight gleam-
ing on her frightened face caught his attention. Half faint-
ing, she repeated her exclamation, adding—
“It moaned like summat wick.”

6—))
Not stopping to ﬁnish his sentence, he snatched a light
from the table, and was unbolting the cellar-door before the
governor or anyone else could comprehend his movements.
They understood well enough when he came back into their
midst, burdened with the limp, dripping form of Jabez,
white and insensible, and dep05iting him on a settle near the
kitchen ﬁre, cried out for restoratives.
That was a terrible next morning, when the young mis-
creants, as much afraid to play truant as to face possibilities
at school, sneaked to their places and set to their studies
with industry out of the common. Laurence Aspinall,
boarding with a master, had no choice in the matter.
How Jabez got into the water was not clear; he was too
ill to be questioned over-night, and was in a fever and
delirious by noon the next day. But he had never been
known to loiter or go astray when sent on an errand. Kit
Townley’s impulsive cry of alarm had suggested foul play,
and neither joshua Brookes nor Governor Terry had let the
night pass without an effort to dive into the truth.
Dr. Stone had conjectured Kit Townley to be a Grammar
School boy, although personally unknown to him; and that
conjecture recalled to Joshua his father’s ravings of ill~usage,
which he had at the time regarded as drunken maudling.

The Manchester Man. v89
It was ascertained that the boy had been at Harrop’s. Inquiry,
and the search for the missing parcel, resulted in the discovery
of a trampled play-ground, broken whiplashes, a string of cob-
nuts, and, neatly marked in red cotton with his initials, one of
Laurence Aspinall’s cambric ruffles, torn and muddy.
There was a conference with Dr. Jeremiah Smith before
the night was out. A messenger was sent to Mr. Aspinall
in Cannon Street the next morning, as well as to the trustees
of the school.
The following day saw such another conclave as before in
the Grammar School. Dr. Stone, who was present, picked
out the boy who had given the alarm, and Kit Townley,
trembling for himself, told all he knew Ben Travis, at the
outset, in his indignation, proffered his evidence, which went
to prove malice prepense.
The boys, asked what they had to say for them selves,
simply answered they had done it for “ sport ”—-that they did
not mean to throw him oVer, but only to frighten him to
“hold his tongue,” and excused their running home on the
plea that they were “afraid.” Laurence Aspinall boldly said
that he knew the boy could swim, and did not think a duck-
ing would do him much harm, and offered to jump off the
wall and swim down the river himself. Liar as well as boaster,
he received a summary check from Dr. Smith, apart from the
reprimand administered to him as the proven ring-leader.
In these days such a case of outrage would have been
brought before a magistrate, and the offenders’ names sent
ﬂying through newspaper paragraphs. Then, whether to spare
the parental feelings of such inﬂuential men as Mr. Aspinall,
or to save from tarnish the fair fame of the school, or to
avert the further debasement of the boys from prison contact,
and give them a chance to amend, the school tribunal was
allowed to be all-sufﬁcient.
Ignominious expulsion was dealt out not only to 'Laurence
Aspinall and to Ned Barret, but to each of the conspirators-—
Kit Townley, honourably acquitted by them of participation in
the ﬁnal attack, alone escaping with a caution, a severe repri-
mand, and as severe a ﬂogging; which special immunity he had
purchased by running white-faced to give the alarm. It is pos-
sible he scarcely estimated the value of that immunity at the time.
But the loud hurrahs which hailed this sentence testiﬁed
how the Grammar School boys valued their honour as a school,
and how proud they were to be purged of such offenders.

90 v The Manchester Man.
Mr. Aspinall, too much agitated to witness his son’s public
disgrace, waited the result of the inquiry in the head-master’s
house ; and if ever Laurence Aspinall felt ashamed of his own
misconduct, it was when his father refused to take his un-
worthy hand as they left the door-step, and he heard Dr. Smith’s
c105ing words of reproof mingled with compassion for the
father, in whose eyes were signs of tears a bad son had drawn.
Long before Jabez was able to resume his own place in the
school, Laurence Aspinall had been removed to an expensive
boarding-school at Everton, near Liverpool; and this time the
merchant laid stress on his tendency “ for vicious and low pure
suits,” and begged that no efforts or expense might be spared
to make him a gentleman in all respects. Still he tampered
with the truth, lest the school-master (he would be called a
Principal in these factitious days) should refuse to admit a
pupil with such antecedents, and decline the task of eradicating
cruelty and ingratitude.
Here Laurence certainly mixed only with boys of his own
class, from whom money could buy neither ﬂattery nor favour,
and where only his own merits could procure either. And
here we must leave him, to pursue the fortunes of the boy
whose life he had wantonly imperilled.
Had anything been wanting to bespeak Joshua Brookes’s
good-will, Jabez supplied it when he interfered to protect the
elder Brookes from the derisive indignities of others. Not
only to Mrs. Clowes did he rehearse in his own peculiar
manner the story, as told by Ben Travis, with its supplementary
drama which had so nearly proved a tragedy, but at such tables
as he frequented—Mr. Chadwick’s among the rest.
Mr. Ashton, who was present, spoke of being himself a wit-
ness to the former scene, and, whilst presenting his inevitable
snuH-box to the eccentric chaplain, repeated his previous
observation—“ I must look after that boy—I must indeed.”
If the parson had been commonly observant he would have
noticed a pair of black eyes ﬁxed in eager attention on his,
as he, who rarely uttered a commendation, held forth in praise
of his father’s champion, the Blue-coat boy; the said black
eyes being matched by the black hair, and somewhat dark skin,
of the plain but intelligent daughter of his host.
But girls of ﬁfteen were then counted in the category of children,
and were taught only to “speak when spoken to,” so Ellen
Chadwick passed no other commentary on the actions of Jabez
than was expressed by her glowing cheeks and eloquent eyes.

CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.
JABEZ cons INTO THE WORLD.
SHARP illness followed the precipitation of Jabez into
the Irk; but he was young, had a strong constitution,
and, to the satisfaction of all in the College, and many out of
it, was able to take his place in the refectory, and clear the
beef or the potato-pie from his wooden trencher, before the
month expired. Prior to this, he was allowed an afternoon,
ere he was well enough to resume fully his routine duties, to
show himself to the kind friends who had exhibited most
anxiety for his recovery.
Mrs. Clowes was one of these. Jam, jelly, and cakes, never
concocted within the area of the College, had found their way
to his bedside. Grateful for kindness from so unlikely a
quarter, Jabez paid his ﬁrst visit to the shop in Half . Street, to
thank the queer old lady. But not one word of thanks would
she hear.
“Eh, lad, say naught about it; you did your duty, and I
did mine, and so we’re quits ; ” and shook her open hand a few
inches in advance of her face, as if she were shaking a dis-
claimer out of it. “ And where are you taking your white face
to now? ” she asked quickly, the better to turn the tide of his
stammering thanks.
“ To Aunt Bess’s.”
“Why, lad, Bess Clegg’ll have naught to give thee ﬁt for
sick folk to eat. It’s much to me if she’ll have either a potato
or a drop of milk. If she’s a bit of jannock, or oat-cake, it’s
as much as the bargain. War may be glorious for kings and
generals, but it’s awful for poor folk ; Mesters can’t sell their
goods, and can’t pay wages bout money ; and I’ve heard that,
since th’ potato riots in Shudehill last Spring, the folk have been
so clemmed that some on them couldna be known by their
friends who hadna seen them for awhile ; they were naught but
skin, and bone, poor things!”

Whilst indulging in this tirade against war and its concomi-
tants, to distract his attention, she bustled about, often with
her back to him ,- then dived into her parlour, and returned
with a basket, which she was handing to him, with a charge to
“take that to Bess, and be sure bring the basket back safe,”
when she found that Joshua Brookes was standing behind
Jabez, amongst waiting customers, with a sharp eye on her pro-
ceedings.
“ I say, young Cheat-the-ﬁshes, what have you got to say for
yourself? A nice young ragamuﬂin you are, to go a-bathing
without leave, spoiling your clothes, and giving yourself cold!
I hope they gave you plenty of physic, to teach you better,”
said Joshua roughly, taking the boy by the shoulder, and turn-
ing him sharply round to confront him.
“Yes, sir—they gave me plenty of physic,” said Jabez, dofﬁng
his cap respectfully. “ But I did not go bathing ,- I got into
the water by accident.”
“By what? Do you call that an accident?” growled the
parson, to get at the boy’s meaning.
“An accident done a-purpose,” chimed in Mrs. Clowes,
whilst her scales jingled, and she and her helper weighed out
her commodities for the people at the counter.
“ Yes, sir,” answered Jabez, composedly; “it must have
been an accident. I don’t think they really could mean to
push me over. I think they only meant to frighten me ”
“ Well? ” queried Joshua, seeing that he hesitated.
“I think one of them slipped, and let go, and then I slipped
too, sir,” he replied, modestly.
“ Slipped, indeed l You’d very nearly slipped into the next
world!” exclaimed the parson. “I suppose you’ll say next
that my poor old father was dragged about by the young
wretches by accident too?”
The colour of Jabez rose.
“ N o, sir ; that was very cruel.” '
“Oh, you do call some things by their right names (here, let
that woman pass out). I suppose you’re glad enough- the
rascals have got their deserts ? ”
A dubious change came over the boy’s face. He did not
answer at once ,- he hardly knew his own feelings on the
subject. The question was repeated.
“Well, sir, I’m glad they won’t be there to torment me any
more, but it must be a very dreadful thing for a young gentle-
man to be turned out of school in disgrace. and I don’t think

I ought to be glad of that. I should never get over it, if it was
me.”
“ Here, take your basket, and be off with you 1” said Joshua
Brookes, hurrying him out of the shop, that he might stay and
rate the old woman for “ spoiling young Cheat-the-ﬁshes,”
conscious all the while that he had been doing his best to get
the lad a good home in the future.
Bess and Simon received him with open arms, glad not
only to see him well again, but thankful he had been placed
where he was secure from the bitter want which pinched both
their stomachs and their faces. To them Mrs. Clowes’ basket
brought what they had not seen for months—a white loaf and
a good lump of cold meat, to say nothing of a tiny paper of tea,
and some sugar—those luxuries of the rich—and half-a-crown
in another paper.
How those half-famishing hard-workers, whose home had
been denuded of their goods to keep life within them, thanked
cross old Mrs. Clowes! She had made it a festival to them
indeed, and all for the sake of the boy they had kept.
There were no pigeons—these had been sold long ago, to
pay for provisions, though much against Simon’s will. The
cat was there, lean and gaunt ; it managed to pick up a sub-
sistence somehow; and the big Bible was there—Simon had
not parted with that, though the bright bureau was gone, ay,
and the cradle which had been an ark to the orphan.
The change touched Jabez sorely. Snugly housed and fed
within the College, rumours of outer poverty made no lasting
impression ; but here he saw its grim reality, and sitting down
on the three-legged stool, he covered his face with his hands
to hide the tears called up by that insight into their im-
poverished condition. Yet had they some alleviation of their
pain. Poverty appeared to have lost half its bitterness for
Bess. She had had a letter from her long-mourned T om, and
the joyful news served to brighten up the visit for Jabez and
all.
It was a long and deeply repentant letter, of course written
by a comrade. It was dated from Badajoz, and had been a
weary while in reaching them. He had been wounded in that
brilliant assault, and while in hospital had fallen in with another
Lancashire lad, also wounded—no other than the boy who had
lent a hand to rescue the infant Jabez, and who had been
driven to enlist by the sharp pangs of hunger, only two years
before. From this young fellow, Private John Smith (Tom

was himself a Corporal), he had learned how grievously his
Bess had been slandered 5 but with that knowledge had come
the conviction that he had condemned her hastily and harshly
on mere hearsay, and the letter was incoherent in its remorseful
contrition. In his soldier-life he had been tossed hither and
thither—known pain, and thirst, and famine ; and said he owed
it all to his own jealous credulity, when he ought to have
known so much better. He told of marchings and counter-
marchings, battles and bloodshed ; but of never one wound to
himself, though he had not “cared a cast of the shuttle” for
his life until that bayonet-thrust which had laid him side by
side with John Smith, who had lost an eye. But he wound up
with a prayer for Bess and himself, and a hope for their
reunion, if the war would ever end. He “was sick of it.”
All that letter was to Bess and Simon, Jabez could not com-
prehend ; but he took Mrs. Clowes her empty basket, and went
back to the College satisﬁed that one ray of sunshine lit up the
poor home of his friends.
And Matthew Cooper’s last chance was gone.
it * 5i? *- *
Mr. Ashton was what is known in trade as a small-ware
manufacturer—that is, he was a weaver of tapes, inkles, ﬁllet-
ings ; silk, cotton, and worsted laces (for furniture) ; carpet
bindings, brace-webs, and fringes. Moreover, he manufactured
braces and umbrellas, for which latter his brother-in-law
supplied the ginghams. He had at work, both in Manchester
and at Whaley-Bridge, a number of swivel-engines, the design
of which came from those unrivalled tape-weavers, the Dutch,
and which would weave twenty-four lengths of tape or bed-lace
at one time. Otherwise, the bulk of his workpeople—winders,
warpers, brace, fringe, and umbrella-makers—carried away
materials to their own homes, and brought back their work in
a ﬁnished state.
Mr. Chadwick, as we have mentioned, was a manufacturer of
ginghams—this included checks and fustians ; but much of
his trade being foreign, the war had locked up his resources,
.and his anxieties preyed on his health.
Mr. Ashton had suffered less in this particular, not having
disdained to take his sensible wife’s advice—“ Never put too
many eggs in one basket.” Mrs. Ashton, be it said, had a
leaning towards “ proverbial philosophy ” more homely and
terse than Tupper’s, which, vulgar as it is accounted now, was
in esteem when our century was young; and, had it been

otherwise, would have been equally impressive from her delibe-
rately modulated utterance. This same lady had, moreover,
an aptitude for business. Mr. Ashton employed a number of
young women, and Mrs. Ashton might be found most days
in the warehouse, either “ putting out ” or inspecting the work
brought in by them, with a gingham wrapper over her “ silken
sheen.” If the footman announced visitors, the wrapper was
thrown aside in a moment, and she stepped into her drawing
room as though fresh from her toilette, and with no atmosphere
of dozens, grosses, or great-grosses about her.
She was wont to say, “ The eye of a master does more work
than both his hands,” accordingly in house or warehouse her
active supervision kept other hands from idling, and she
certainly digniﬁed whatever duties she undertook, whether she
used hands or eyes only.
In those days a seven-years’ apprenticeship to any trade or
business was deemed essential ; apprentices were part and
parcel of commercial economy, and when Mr. Ashton spoke of
“looking after that boy,” it was that he thought Jabez Clegg
bade fair to be a ﬁtter inmate and a more reliable servant than
others whose terms were about to expire.
Through his friend the Rev. Joshua Brookes he ascertained
the boy’s age and other particulars, and sought the House-
Governor Mr. Terry, and laid before him a proposition to take
Jabez Clegg as his apprentice, on very fair terms. He then
learned that Mr. Shaw, the saddler at the bottom of Market
Street-lane, was also desirous to obtain the same Blue-coat boy
as an apprentice, his friend the leather-breeches maker having
named the lad to him.
At the Easter meeting of feoﬁ'ees both proposals were laid
before them—Simon Clegg, as standing in low parentz's to
Jabez, being present. After some little discussion Mr.
Ashton’s proposal was accepted, to the great satisfaction of the
tanner, and in a few days Jabez was transferred to his new
master for mutual trial until Ascension Day, when, if all parties
were satisﬁed, his indentures would be signed. As the
governor said, it had “been but the toss of a button ” whether
he had gone to Mr. Shaw or Mr. Ashton :—yet upon that toss
of a button the whole future of Jabez depended.
Jabez Clegg entered on his new career under good auspices
-—that is, he bore with him a good character for steadiness and
probity, though nothing was said of brilliant parts, or 'any
special talent which he possessed. Indeed his school-master

had said that only his indomitable perseverence had enabled
him to keep pace with others. If he had any latent genius
any particular vocation, no one had discovered it; his faculty
for disﬁguring doors and walls with devices in coloured chalks,
picked up amongst the gravel, had been matter for punishment
not praise, and none but the College boys themselves cared to
know where the fresh patterns for purses and pincushions came
from. Steadiness, perseverance, probity—they were good
materials out of which to manufacture a tradesman (so Mr.
Ashton thought), and congratulations were mutual.
Jabez went, with his new outﬁt, to his new home under good
auspices, inasmuch as both master and mistress were pre-pos-
sessed in his favour, and they stood in the foremost ranks of
those who began to recognise that English apprentices were not
bond-slaves in heathendom. Instead of being crammed to
sleep like dogs in holes under counters ; left to wash at a pump
and wipe themselves where they could ; obliged to sit at a table
in a back kitchen, and dip their spoons into one common dish
of porridge, or potatoes and buttermilk ; to eat such scraps and
refuse as sordid employers, or ill-disposed cooks, chose to set
before their primitive Adamite forks—instead of a system like
this, from which apprentices (of whatever grade) only emerged
at the beginning of this century, the Ashtons’ apprentices had a
comfortable dormitory in the attic, there was a coarse jack-towel
by the scullery-sink for their use, they had their meals with the
servants in the kitchen, where was an oak settle by the ﬁre for
them when work was over.
But work did not end with the close of the warehouse. They
were expected to keep their attic clean and in order, to cleanse
the wooden or pewter platters, or porringers, from which they
had dined or supped ; to rinse the horns which had held their
table-beer ; to fetch and carry wood, coals, and water, for
servants too lazy to do their own work; and it was not much
rest any apprentice had from ﬁve or six in a morning until
eight or nine at night, when he went to his bed.
As the youngest apprentice, the roughest of this work fell on
Jabez, but, luckily, his training had made him equal to the
occasion ; though Kezia, the red-faced cook, set herself stead~
fastly to dislike him, because Mr. Ashton had bespoken her
favour for him. In the warehouse, too, the evident good-will
of principals roused the jealously of underlings, so that “ good
auspices” had their corresponding drawbacks.
It was not much of a pleasure to Jabez to ﬁnd Kit Townley

The jllanchester Man. 97
also seated as an apprentice on the kitchen settle; but the
youth seemed disposed to be friendly, and Jabez forbore to
create a grievance by recalling unpleasant reminiscences. With
Kit Townley, who was his senior by a year, a heavy premium
had been paid, and on this he was inclined to presume. But
neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ashton made any social distinction
between the twain, and Jabez was strong enough to hold his own.
During the few weeks’ probation Jabez was transferred from
department to department, alike to test his capacity and his
own liking for the business. Both proved satisfactory.
On Ascension Day, 1813, there was another appearance in
that ancient room before the College magnates. many of whom,
as oﬂicers in volunteer regiments, were in full-dress uniform (a
dinner pending). The indentures had to be signed, the pre-
mium of £4 (returnable to the boy when his term expired) had
to be paid.
Simon Clegg’s best clothes had long been lost in the pawn-
broker’s bottomless pit : but some one unknown (mayhap Mrs.
Clowes or Mrs. Clough) had sent him overnight a suit of fresh
ones, pronounced by him and Bess “ welly as good as new ; ”
and he presented himself for the important ceremony (over-
looked by the painted face of the orphan’s benevolent friend,
Humphrey Chetham) as proud almost of his ownrestored respect-
ability as of the part he was about to perform. When it came
to his turn to sign the document, the little man took the pen
with a ﬂourish, as if he were a hero about to perform some
mighty action. He stooped to the heavy oaken table, bent
his head low, alternately to the right and left, and with his
ﬁngers in an unaccountable crump, imprinted his self-taught
signature in Roman capitals thereon, then handed back the
quill as if to say, “The deed is done 1 ”
Governor, school-master, and feoffees congratulated Mr.
Ashton and Jabez both. Simon, with moist eyes, shook Jabez
by the hand, and holding the boy’s shoulder with his left to look
the better in his clear dark eyes, said with deliberate emphasis——
“ Jabez, lad, aw’m preawd on yo’ this day. But moind-
thah’s an honourable neame: do nowt to disgrace it, an’ yo’r
fortin’s made ! ”
Jabez was too abashed to make reply at the time ; but at the
supper given in the kitchen, to mark his installation at Mr.
Ashton’s—to which Bess and Simon were both invited—Jabez
contrived to whisper,
“You needn’t clem any more, Bess ; I’ll give you all my wages.”

CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.
APPRENTICESHIP.
—the very lowest rung of the ladder. Not long did he
remain there. The bright colours in the lace and brace
rooms had an attraction for him, and he argued with himself
that the better he did the rough work assigned him the sooner
he should mount above it. And Jabez the plodding Blue-coat
boy, was ambitious. That ambition had a threefold stimulus.
Manchester people were then, as a rule, steady church and
chapel-goers. Mr. Ashton had two pews at the Old Church ;
one for his family, the other for servants and apprentices, the
attendance of the latter being imperative. Jabez thus came in
frequent contact with his old-time friends, from the Blue-coat
boys in the Chetham Gallery to the Cleggs, to whom went
every penny of his earnings ; their distress, like that of
others, having deepened with the continuation of the Napo-
leonic war.
Sometimes old Mrs. Clowes, meeting him in the church-
yard, would grasp him by the hand, and leave something in it,
as, in her old black stuff dress and coloured kerchief tied over
her mob-cap, she hurried. homewards to scold dilatory hand-
maids, and put her Christianity in practice amongst her
pensioners.
Now and then Joshua Brookes crossed his path, and if he
did not put his hand in his breeches pocket for Jabez—now a
well-grown youth-he gave him more than sterling coin in
sterling advice, though, unfortunately, in so abrupt and
grotesque amanner, its effect was frequently lost. Yet one day
when the Blue-coat boy had been barely two years at the
Mosley Street manufacturer’s, he put a spur into the sides of
his ambition.
JABEZ now began his work in earnest, in the packing-room

“Young Cheat-the-ﬁshes, were you ever in Mrs. Chadwick’s
green parlour?”
“Yes, sir—I was there once for half-anhour.” (The day he
took back Miss Ellen’s shilling.)
“ Well did you read the sermons on the walls?”
]abez answered respectfully—
“I did _not see any sermons, sir. I saw some pictures in
black frames with gilt roses at the corners.”
“ And didn’t look at them, I suppose P ” in a harsh grunt.
“ Yes, sir, I did ! I was waiting till Mrs. Chadwick had done
dinner. They were about two boys—a good and bad apprentice.”
“ Oh, then, you did use your eyes! The next time they let
you inside that room, just use your understanding too. William
Hogarth, the artist, from his grave preaches a sermon to you
and your fellows, as good as Parson Gatliffe preached from the
pulpit this morning, mark that! ” and he turned on his heel
with an emphasising nod to ﬁx iris sermon on the boy’s mind.
The opportunity came before long. It was customary when
an apprentice went with a message to leave him in the hall, or
send him into the kitchen; but Jabez being sent by Mrs.
Ashton with several samples of furniture-binding and fringes
for her sister’s use, he was shown with his parcel into the
parlour, where Mrs. Chadwick, neatly attired in a brown stuff
dress, with a French cambric kerchief lying in folds under the
square bodice, sat at work with an upholsteress, in the midst of a.
mass of chintz and moreen, preparing for the new home of
Ellen’s elder sister Charlotte ; for, in spite of war, distress, or
famine, people will marry and give in marriage. And had not a
glorious peace just been concluded P
Ellen, a comely but not pretty girl, about seventeen, whose
black eyes and hair were her chief attractions, sat there in a
purple bombazine dress, with her sheathed scissors and College
pincushion suspended by a chain from her girdle, plying her
needle most industriously. He was not accustomed to
parlours, and no doubt his bow was as awkward as his blush ;
but he had a message to deliver, and he did that in a business
like manner. He had to wait until pattern after pattern' was
tried against the chintz, and calculations made. Mrs. Chad-
wick, seeing his eyes wander wistfully from picture to picture,
courteously gave him permission to examine them.
At once Ellen, who was sitting close under one, rose to act
as interpreter. She was recalled by the mild voice of her
mother.

“Sit down, Ellen; Jabez Clegg does not require a young lady’s
help to understand those pictures—they explain themselves.”
Ellen went back to her seat and her sewing with a raised
colour, and a private impression that the rebuke was uncalled
for, though she spoke never a word. Perhaps Mrs. Chadwick
thought condescension should have its limits, and did not
believe in a. young lady’s impulsive civility to an apprentice
Blue-coat boy. Yet that was not like Mrs. Chadwick.
Miss Augusta had been staying with her aunt. Part of his
commission was to convoy her home ; she was an only child,
and too precious to be trusted out alone, though she was in her
eleventh year, and the distance was nothing. But so many
desperadoes had been let loose by the termination of the war
that crime and violence were rampant, footpads infested high-
ways and byways, and Cicily, Augusta’s maid—ex-nurse—was
no longer deemed a protection.
He stood before the last engraving lwhen Augusta—in no awe
of her father’s apprentice—came dancing into the room in a
nankeen dress and tippet, a hat with blue ribands, long wash-
ing-gloves which left the elbows bare, and blue shoes tied with
a bunch of ribands.
Bright, beautiful, buoyant—she was a picture in herself ; and
Jabez turned from the dingy engraving to think so. She often
came tripping into the warehouse or the kitchen, and ex-
changed a bright word with one or other, and away again ; but
Jabez had thought of her only as a pretty playful child until
that afternoon. Joshua Brookes pointing Hogarth’s lessons
had given the one spur; that lovely brown-eyed, brown-haired
maiden, with her simple, “Come, Jabez—I’m ready,” had
given another.
She put her little gloved hand in his, after bidding her aunt
and cousin good-bye, and went dancing, skipping, and chatter-
ing by his side down Oldham Street, and let him lift her over
the muddy crossing to Mosley Street, unconscious of the
chimerical dreams ﬂoating through his apprentice brain all the
while. His original ambition to make a home for Simon and
Bess, where neither penury nor care should trouble them,
dwarfed before the new ideas crowding upon his mind. He
had read the sermon on the wall, but the old “ Knave of
Clubs,” as Joshua was called, little thought how that pretty
piquant little fairy, the “master’s daughter,” would point it
with something higher than ambition.
There were at that period in Manchester two schools for

young ladies, which, being celebrated at the time, deserve to be
mentioned. The one was situated at the extreme end of Brad-
shaw Street, looking through its vista across Shudehill to the
gaps in brickwork called Thomas Street and Nicholas Croft,
where in highly genteel state Mrs. (or Madame, as she insisted
on being called) Broadbent superintended the education of a
large and very select circle.
Education must have been at a low ebb when the chief
manufacturers of the town consigned their daughters to this
pompous, pretentious woman, who could not speak correctly
the language she professed to teach. In her attempt to appear
the print and pattern of a lady, she “ clipped the King’s
English,” and made almost as glaring errors as Mrs. Malaprop.
Yet, strange to say, she turned out ﬁrst-class pupils (for the
period). The fact is, she was shrewd enough to know her own
deﬁciencies, and delegated her duties to others who were in all
respects eﬂicient.
Then she was a wonderful trumpeter of her own fame ; made
frequent visitations at houses where she was well entertained,
and her bombast was listened to for the sake of her young
charges; held half-yearly recitations, and also exhibitions of
the plain sewing, embroidery, knitting, knotting, ﬁligrees, tam-
bour, and lace work of her pupils ; and matrons proud of their
own daughters’ achievements seldom paused to reckon up the
tears, the headaches, the heartaches, the sore ﬁngers which
those minutely-stitched shirts, those ﬁne lace aprons and rufﬂes,
those pictures and samplers had cost. For Madame Broad-
bent, besides being a martinet rigid in her rule—having a
numbered rack for pattens and slippers, numbered pegs for
cloaks and hats, book-bags and work-bags, safe-guards (recep—
tacles for sewing, &c., like a huckster’s pocket) and slates, all
numbered likewise—was not of too mild a temper, and had a
penchant for pinching her pupils’ ears until the blood tinged her
nails; and stocks for the feet, backboards for the shoulders,
and dry bread diet were her prescriptions for the cure of such
delinquencies as an unauthorised word, an omitted curtsey, a
bag or garment on the wrong hook, a dropped stitch in knitting,
a blotted copy, a puckered seam; and work had to be done
and undone until stitches were almost invisible, and little eyes
almost blind. She had other peculiarities, had Madame Broad-
bent—but my portrait is growing too large for its frame, and
she was not a large personage at all.
It was to this delectable individual’s school (“establishments”

had not been invented then, or hers would have been one) that
Miss Augusta Ashton was consigned for conversion into a well-
behaved, well~informed, useful, and accomplished young lady.
Her cousins, the Misses Chadwick, had in their turn escaped
from this penitentiary for the manufacture of ladyhood. But
in Piccadilly was a school of a very different description, where
young ladies of talent and fortune went to qualify for wzfehcaa';
and here at this time Ellen Chadwick was ﬁnishing her education,
with many others, in learning the culinary art in all its branches.
How came it that Madame Broadbent’s school ﬂourished
and survived the decay of its neighbourhood, being in existence
when the writer of this was a child, and the other had died and
been forgotten, save by the antiquary, before she was born ?
To fetch Miss Ashton home from Madame Broadbent’s on
dark or stormy afternoons, was the understood duty of one or
other of the apprentices ; but Kit Townley, having no more
liking for wet weather than a cat, generally contrived to be out
of earshot when his services were required. \It devolved on
Jabez, therefore, to carry the grey duffel hooded cloak with
which to cover the dainty one of scarlet kerseymere, to tie the
pattens onthe tiny feet, to carry the school-bag, and hold the
brilliant blue gingham umbrella over the head elevated by the
pattens so much nearer to his shoulder, and to be thanked by
one of the sweetest voices in the world. ‘
It was dangerous work, though no one knew it, least of all
Jabez. True, she was only a child, but she was tall for her age.
And was he much more than a boy ? A boy let out from the
seclusion of an almost monastic institution, to whom her little
airs and graces, her petty vanities, her very waywardness and
caprice, only made her beauty more piquant.
Madame Broadbent’s infallibility being taken for granted, all
attempts to make known school troubles and grievances were
met with “Never tell tales out of school,” from Mrs. Ashton,
but they were poured fresh and warm into the ear of Jabez, as
she trotted.by his side; and he,,his school-days unforgotten,
listened with ready sympathy. And this went on as months
and years went by, adding to her stature, narrowing the space
between them ; and he still did duty as her humble escort, unless
when Kit Townley was especially told off for the service and went
reluctantly, grumbling at being made “ lackey to a school miss.”
Yet Kit Townley did not think it any degradation to play
practical jokes on Jabez, or on Kezia, leaving the younger ape
prentice to bear the blame. Billets of wood, scuttles of coal,

The Manchester Man. 10 3
pails of water brought in for her use by Jabez, were dexterously
removed to doorways and other unsuspected places, whefe
“cook ” was sure to stumble over them, and then cuff Jabez
for his carelessness or wilfulness, all protestations on his part
being disregarded. Creeping behind the settle where JabeZ’sat
watching, and perhaps basting the roast for the maSte'r’s table
for late dinners on company days, he would steal his sly arm
round the corner, himself unseen, and lifting the wheel of the
spit out of the smoke-jack chain, bring spit and all thereon into
the dripper, with a splash which brought the irate Kezia down
on astounded Jabez with whatsoever weapon of offence came
nearest to her hand, from the paste—pin to the basting-ladle, or
even a saucepan lid ; it was all one to Kezia.
From Kezia, however, these frequent chances and mischances
went to Kezia’s mistress ; and appearances being against him,
the very steadiness of denial, unaccompanied with any accusa-
tion of another (other waggeries of Kitv Townley in the ware-
house being also laid on his shoulder), Mrs. Ashton’s faith in
the youth was somewhat shaken, and he was conscious of being
under a cloud. But still he kept on his way and looked to the end.
The cloud dispersed after a while. Kit Townley was some-
thing of a glutton, with a very boy’s love of pastry and sweets.
It so happened that on a special occasion (rejoicing for peace
or something) Kezia had set aside in her roomy pantry, the
door of which fastened only with a button, a tray of tartlets,
custards, a triﬂe, moulds of jelly and blanc-mange, and other
dainties for a large party. Kit’s mouth watered to get at these
things. Often and often had he stolen the fruit from under a
pie-crust, and sat silent while Jabez bore the blame, but now .
he meditated a more sweeping raid. There wasa ﬁne retriever
in the yard. Watching Kezia out of the way, he crammed
mouth and pockets with the pastry, and made an inroad into
the triﬂe. Then he whistled to 'Nelson, raised the dog on his
hind feet, and printed the forepaws on the pantry-shelf, dishes,
and tart-tray, and round the button of the door.
But he was compelled to wait until bed-time to fairly enjoy
his spoil, and then could not manage it unknown to his corn-r
panion. Hoping to close the other’s mouth literally and
ﬁguratively, he offered him a share, but Jabez told him he was
not a receiver of stolen goods, and left him to digest that with
his feast. It was a harder morsel than even Jabez knew.
The next morning before breakfast they were in the ware-
house, when there was heard a terrible commotion in the

yard. From the back windows Kezia was seen belabouring
Nelson with a broomstick, her face redder than ordinary, whilst
the poor beast whined piteously.
Jabez ran down to interpose, and the infuriated woman
turned on him, then ran in her rage to fetch her mistress to
witness the damage done, and the footprints of the depredator,
and to own that punishment was just.
But as Mrs. Ashton ascended the warehouse stairs that
afternoon, she heard Jabez and Kit loud in altercation, and
before they were aware she possessed a clue to much that had
gone before.
Something Jabez had said was answered by a loud guffaw
from Kit, and the words——
“Let them laugh that win. I call it a deuced good
joke.”
“And I call it cowardly and dishonourable to let the poor
beast suffer for your greediness,” Jabez answered, indignantly.
“Now don’t you put in your oar, young yellow-skirt. I’ll
let no charity—boy hector over me,” blustered Kit.
Jabez put down a bundle of umbrella whalebones he had
I on his shoulder, to confront the other, then counting
ferules into dozens. Umbrellas used to have brass ferules,
like elongated thimbles, on the sticks.
“Look you, Kit, I’ve borne many a scurvy trick of yours
without saying a word, but I will not even give the sanction
of silence to dishonesty, and will not see a noble animal ill~
used to screen a coward.”
“Won’t you?” sneered Kit, “then we’ll see whose word
weighs heaviest.“
Mrs. Ashton came into the room.
“Townley,” said she, “your word will not weigh down a
feather henceforth,” adding in the same digniﬁed tone, “Are
those ferules counted ? Jackson is waiting for them.”
No further notice was taken, but Jabez soon found he
stood on a ﬁrmer footing in house and warehouse. Mrs.
Ashton remarked to her husband, as she ﬁnished dressing for
their dinner-party—
“It was a slight circumstance, William, but straws show
which way the wind blows.” '
And he tapped his silver snuff-box, and said “Just so ;”
then courteously offering his hand to his ﬁne-looking wife, led
her from the room, her purple velvet robe trailing after her, the
plumes on her head nodding as they went.

CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.‘
IN WAR AND PEACE.
CLAP of thunder burst over Europe, and the great war
eagle ﬂapped his monstrous wings again. Napoleon had
escaped from Elba ere crops had had time to grow on his
trampled battle-ﬁelds ; yet crops of men rose ripe for the
sickle, and home expectations were dashed to the ground.
How many an anxious parent, how many a longing, love-sick
maiden, looked for her warrior back from Canada or the Conti-
nent, if only on furlough 0r sick-leave ! How many a weary
soldier, sated with blood, looked for discharge with pension or
reward, and thirsted for the fountain of home joys !
And from how many lips was the cup of delight dashed when
the cry “ To arms l” rang out from mount to vale, from peak to
peak, from town to town, and the sheathed sword ﬂashed forth
to light, and forges belched forth ﬂame through day and night,
preparing for fresh holocausts in the new carnival of blood !
Trade centres at all such times are most convulsed, as being
also centres of humanity—depots whence fresh relays are
drafted from the ranks or men whose peaceful work is at a
sudden standstill. But that war blast came like a ﬁery‘ﬂash,
and commerce, only then a feeble convalescent, sank crushed
and hopeless. '
Mr. Chadwick felt it keenly, and, but that his more cautious
and wealthy brother-in-law came to his help with hand as open
as his snuff-box, his credit must have gone. His two eldest
sons had gone from him, drawn away by the phantom Glory.
One, Richard, was a midshipman upon Collingwood’s ship; the
other, Herbert, a lieutenant in the 72nd, or Manchester Volun—
teers, had departed with his regiment to ﬁght in the Peninsular.
A third son, John, had been left to do his quiet duty in the
counting-house, but Death had laid its clutches on him soon
after his sister Charlotte’s marriage, and Ellen alone kept the
house from utter desolation.

106 The Manchester Man.
She was a girl of strong feelings and quick impulses, but
pursued her way with so little show or pretence, she was hardly
accredited with all the comfort she brought to the hearth ; and
scarcely her mother even suspected how that hidden heart of
hers could throb—how intense were her emotions.
. Her love for every member of the family was deep, but when
her brother John died, after the ﬁrst terrible outburst of grief
she dried her tears, and by mere force of will set herself to
soothe those who had lost a son. The prolonged absence of
the others had been fruitful of pain, and the glad prospect
of Herbert’s return now blighted came to her, as to father
and mother, with a shock like a stab.
There was another hearth we have ere-while visited—a
hearth which, thanks to Jabez, and a few months’ regular
employment for the batting—rods and the tanner’s plunger,
was less poverty-stricken than it had been—~and where Hope
had held out delusive banners to herald a soldier’s return,
only to furl them again for another march, before eye could
meet eye, or lip meet lip.
Thirteen years had come and gone since last Tom Hulme
and Bessy Clegg had looked woefully upon each other——
thirteen years of unrecorded trial and suffering—yet still they
were apart. The home in which he had known her ﬁrst,
Tanner’s Bridge, on which he had ﬁrst made love to her,
had been swept away to make room for Ducie Bridge and
a new high-road; and the best years of her womanhood were
passing too. Would he ever come back whilst grey-haired
Simon could bless their union? Would he ever come back
againR Tears fell on Bess’s batting; and Simon had not one
word of comfort to give her. Even Matt Cooper, who had
long since resigned himself to his widowhood, was magnani-
mous enough to be sorry.
The new war between the “Corsican Vampire” and allied
Europe was fortunately of short duration; but how much of
carnage and misery was compressed into that campaign which
had its brilliant close at Waterloo l
In the onset of that terrible conﬂict, Herbert Chadwick and
a cousin, ﬁghting side by side, fell in a storm of grape-shot
like green corn under an untimely shower of hail, and their
blood went to fertilise the Belgian farmer’s future crops of
wheat.
Herbert was his father’s favourite son. Not a mail-morning
passed but the old man made one of the crowd hurrying down

the narrow way called Market-street-lane to the Exchange, to
catch a sight of whatever bulletins might be posted up ; and,
his own mind relieved, sent an apprentice from the F ountain-
street warehouse with the words, “ All’s well 1” to cheer up
those at home. That dreadful morning when his fearful eye
ran down the black list of the killed at Waterloo, and rested
on Lieutenant Chadwick’s name, the letters seemed to turn
blood-red : he shrivelled up like a maple-leaf in a blighting
wind ,- his face and limbs began to twitch, and he fell forward
into the arms of a bystander, in a ﬁt.
He was carried by compassionate hands to the nearest
house, that of John Shaw, the saddler. A merchant on
’Change (Mr. Aspinall) undertook to break the doubly»
calamitous intelligence to Mrs. Chadwick. Dr. Hardie, whom
the general excitement had drawn to the spot, was with him in
an instant, his white neckcloth was loosened, and, whipping out
a lancet, the doctor bled him in the arm without delay. He
rallied sufﬁciently to bear lifting into a carriage, kindly placed
at the doctor’s disposal to convey him home.
Dr. Hull was already in waiting. All that their united skill
could suggest was tried. His recovery was slow and imperfect;
he dragged his right leg after him ; he was paralysed for life.
He was not a young man, and the supreme shook, coming as
it did above a pressure of commercial difﬁculties, had been too
much for him.
It was an overwhelming disaster; but in anxiety and active
care for the stricken one, whose life was in imminent peril, the
sharp edge of the keener stroke was blunted for Ellen and her
mother.
The Ashtons were, as ever, kind and thoughtful.
“William,” said Mrs. Ashton, meditatively to her husband
over the tea-urn, the day after Mr. Chadwick’s attack, “we
must not forget that if John is not related to us, Sarah ” (Mrs.
Chadwick) “and Ellen are. ‘Blood is thicker than water 5’
and it will not do, for their sakes, to let John’s business go tov
rack and ruin for want of supervision.”
“Just so, just so,” he replied, reflectively, taking his snuff-
box out of his pocket mechanically, and putting it back again
unopened, as contrary to tea-table propriety; “I have been
thinking the same myself. I will go round to the warehouse
to-morrow, and see how matters stand ; we must keep things
ship-shape somehow- till John is himself again.”
And he was as good as his word, though he had really never

thought about it until prompted by his clear-headed wife. He
had a habit of thus falling in with her suggestions, though had
any one hinted that he followed the lead of a woman, so much
younger than himself too, he would have rejected the imputa-
tion with scorn. With returning peace came joyful restorations
to many homes, humble as well as lofty.
Before the time of their extreme privation, before even
Simon was out of work, he had taken one of the smallest of
the garden-plots on the higher ground on the opposite side of
the Irk, and cultivated it in what little leisure he had, Bess
giving him a helping hand occasionally. And by the sale of
penny posies to Sunday ramblers from the town, and herbs and
salad to the market women in Smithy door, he did his best to
beat back the gaunt wolf when the wolf came.
Bess had laid by her batting-wands, put a turf in the grate to
kindle up a handful of cinders and slack to boil their supper-
porridge, for, though Autumn was striding on, they could not
waste fuel on a mid-day ﬁre ; Simon was away working in his
garden, whilst the daylight held 3 and she sat, as she frequently
did now, on a low stool in front of the grate, her elbows on
her knees, and her head on her hands, watching, in a kind of
hazy dream, the red glow creeping through the heart of the
turf, when a footstep on the threshold caused her to turn
round.
Like a picture framed by the doorway, stood the tall ﬁgure
of a bronzed soldier, with his left arm in a sling. Before the
sharp cry of joy had well left her lips, his other arm was
around her—both hers around his neck; their lips met in a
long kiss, which told of pain and trouble past, and love‘
through all; and then her head fell on his shoulder in a ﬁt of
convulsive sobbing such as had not shook her frame for years.
Sorrow and joy have both their baptism of tears !
It was a glad sight for Simon to see them sitting, with their
hands locked in each other’s, side by side on an old box,
which served them for a seat—all Simon’s lost furniture had
not come back—silent from excess of happiness, yet radiant as
though the glow of youth were returning in the Midsummer of
their lives.
In the roughest war-time the common requirements of life
have to be satisﬁed, and peaceful trades and arts are of
necessity carried on, albeit they ﬂourish not. And the farther
from the seat of war, and the less private interest is involved,
the less business and household retinue is infringed on.

Thus Mr. Ashton, whose large capital had enabled him to
hide the issues of the Continental and American stoppage of
trade, and who had no nearer relatives in danger than his
wife’s nephews, pursued his way in comparative quiet. Indeed,
he was an easy-going man, with much less vigour of character
than his wife; and she bore little resemblance to her own
sister.
So we may carry our readers away from the poorly-fumished
room in a fetid Long Millgate-yard, leaving the re-united
lovers to the enjoyment of the present and their reminiscences
of the past, and look in upon the Ashtons in their cosy tea-
room before Waterloo cast a black shadow over the family.
It was a spacious apartment (as were most of the rooms in
that habitation), the walls above the surbase (a wooden mould-
ing some two feet above the skirting-board) were painted a
warm dove colour, the surbase and all below in two shades of
light blue. The window-tax—a result of war—laid an embargo
on light, by restricting size and number, so the house, like
most in the neighbourhood, having been built subsequently to
“ Billy Pitt’s ” obnoxious impost, there were only two windows,
and those were narrow. They were draped with heavy
curtains, and festooned valances of dove-coloured moreen,
trimmed with blue orris-lace, and worsted-bullion fringe, with
spiral silken droplets here and there to shimmer in the
rays of sun or chandelier. For there was a chandelier, of
fanciful device, pendent from the wonderfully moulded ceiling,
a septenary of lacquered serpents, whose interlaced and
twisted tails met upwards, separated below in graceful coils,
and branching out their seven heads, turned up their gaping
jaws to close them on wax-lights. The chandelier was no
misnomer ,- but the ﬁery serpents kept their ﬂames for state
occasions, when the serpent branches on each side the long
Venetian looking-glass, between the windows, were on duty
likewise. There was another Venetian glass above the high-
painted chimney-piece, so elaborately carved, but here the
serpent candelabra lit the room for common use, and were
supplemented with lights in tall silver candlesticks upon the
centre table.
Spanish mahogany alike were chairs, and table, and Miss
Augusta’s grand piano—ranged against the wall from the
door, so that the window light should fall upon the keys—
and chairs and tables were alike club-footed, massive, and
plain; there were two folded card tables, a cellaret, and a

work-table, all with tapering legs and club-feet; and there
was a ponderous sofa on the ﬂower-besprent Brussels carpet,
which, without the adventitious aid of artiﬁcial steel springs,
was elastic and soft, and wooed the weary to rest aching
limbs or aching head upon its cushions. There were no anti-
macassars hair-seating did not soil readily.
The air was odorous with rose, lavender, and jessamine, for
the windows were both open, and what little air there was
stirring swept over a large summer nosegay in a china vase
between the windows. The mahogany teaboard was set with
miniature unhandled cups and saucers of china, more precious
than the fragrant decoction they were designed to hold; the
brass tea-urn hissed and spluttered ,' Mrs. Ashton in a rich
dress sat at the table to infuse the tea; Mr. Ashton had
drawn his softly-cushioned easy-chair nearer; it was past ﬁve
by the tall clock in the hall, and Miss Augusta had not pre-
sented herself.
As a thorough business woman, Mrs. Ashton was punctu-
ality itself. She expected her family to be punctual also.
Five o’clock, the Manchester hour for tea, and no Augusta 2
“James l” (to the footman), “inquire for Miss Ashton ; she
is not kept in at school—it is a holiday.”
As the man retired, Augusta, in a white cambric frock heavy
with tambour—work, tripped in at the door, her diaper pinafore
not so clean as it might have been, her hands full of some-
thing which she set down on a side table.
“It is past ﬁve o’clock, Augusta; where have you been
until now? And how came Cicily to send you in to tea with
a soiled pinafore P” asked Mrs. Ashton, with the quiet dignity
which seldom relaxed.
“Is it? I did not hear the clock strike, I was so busy;
and Cicily has not seen my pinafore,” was Augusta’s light
consecutive reply.
“So busy !—Cicily not seen you i” her mother exclaimed in
surprise. “Let me look at your hands. I am shocked,
Augusta! What would Mrs. Broadbent say?” (The hands
were worse than the pinatore.) “Have I not told you re-
peatedly that ‘ cleanliness is next to godliness P’ Go to Cicily
and be washed immediately, or you can have no tea.”
Augusta pouted.
“ Must I, papa?”
The management of this child was the only point on which
Mr. and Mrs. Ashton differed.

“Well, my dear, your mamma says so ; but I think for this
once it may be overlooked, if you will be more careful another
time,” said he, willing to excuse and temp'orise.
“‘Only this once,’ William, ‘is the parent of thrice,’ ” re-
sponded Mrs. Ashton, gravely, as she poured out the tea,
giving something like milk-and-water to Miss Augusta. “You
will spoil that child; and if you spoil her to-day, she will
spoil herself to-morrow. However, as you are inclined to
tolerate that which I think disrespectful to us, and wanting in
self-respect on the child’s part, I can say no more;”
Thus Mrs. Ashton yielded against her judgment; Mr.
Ashton took out his snuff-box, to put it back like a culprit;
and Miss Augusta sat down to the table, not knowing
whether to be more pleased or sorry that she had got her
own way.
To turn the subject, Mr. Ashton asked—
“What is that you put on the card-table, my dear P”
“Oh! I’ll show you,” and away the young lady was run-
ning, only to be recalled by her mother’s decided—
“After tea, Augusta.”
So after tea it was that Miss Augusta brought her treasure
to her father—sundry sheets of paper, on which scraps of
variously-coloured leather had been arranged and pasted in
ornamental patterns, ﬂoral and geometrical, aided by the
stamps employed in piercing brace-ends for the embroiderers,
and in cutting stars to cover the umbrella-wheels inside.
“ Who did those?” asked mother and father in a breath.
“Jabez Clegg, in the warehouse. Aren’t they pretty P” was
Augusta’s ready reply, as she looked admirineg on her curious
pictures.
“Oh! then that accounts for your being late, and in that
condition at the tea-table,” said Mrs. Ashton, as she glanced
from the rich designs before her to the sullied hands and
pinafore.
“ And so Jabez Clegg has been wasting our leather to make
playthings for you?” remarked Mr. Ashton interrogatively, in
a not unkindly tone of voice.
“ No, he hasn’t!” answered little miss, briskly. “ He only
used the waste tiny bits. I wanted to take a big piece to make
a housewife ” (a case for thread and needles), “ and he would
not let me have it. He said he had no right to give it, and I
had no right to take it. Was be right, mamma?” i

“mamma” had come over from France to supersede our
more sterling “father” and “mother,” with other reﬁJgees
from the Revolution]
“Yes, my dear, quite right; but I wish my little daughter
would not run so much into the kitchen and warehouse among
the apprentices,” said the mother, kindly, smoothing down the
light brown hair, in which the sunbeams seemed to weave
golden threads. “It is not becoming in a young lady.”
Mr. Ashton, who had been all the while examining the
glowing devices before him, interrupted her with—
“ I think I have discovered a new faculty in our apprentice.
I shall buy Jabez Clegg a box of colours to-morrow. We are
sadly in want of fresh patterns, and I think he can make
them,” and Mr. Ashton took a large pinch of snuff on the
strength of his discovery.
And Jabez, for the ﬁrst time in his life the possessor of
paints and brushes, became valuable to his master.

CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.
IN THE WAREHOUSE.
UTABILITY is the epitaph of worlds. Change alone
is changeless. People drop out of the history of
a life as of a land, though their work or their inﬂuence re-
mains. A passing word may sufﬁce to dismiss such from our
pages.
The Reverend John Gresswell had been taken by Death
from the Chetham College school-room before more than half
the term of Jabez Clegg’s pupilage had run. Dr. Stone’s
resignation of his librarianship followed close on his discovery
of the half-drowned boy on the dairy-steps. After a long en-
gagement with a young lady who refused many eligible offers,
and withstood much parental persuasion for his sake, he—the
curate of St. John’s Church—accepted the ﬁrst vacant living
in the gift of the college whereof he was fellow. A bridal
closed their almost Jacob’s courtship, and the constant couple
retired to the seclusion of Wooton Rivers, where his learning
and eloquence had seldom more appreciative auditory than
smock-{rocked Wiltshire rustics and their families.
About the same time, or not long after, old Brookes was
missed from the Packhorse, and the Ring-o’-Bells, and the
Apple-Tree, and the Sun Inn—the breeches-maker and his
neighbours ceased to hear his foul and offensive maunderings
and imprecations as he staggered past to his son’s home, there
to test his endurance. He had gone home to his mother-earth,
sober and silent for evermore. And Parson Brookes, left to
his books and his pigeons, sent in his resignation, and the
Grammar School knew him no more as a master. So the
boys felt themselves free to take greater liberties with him
than ever, and kept his hot blood for ever on the simmer.
As all these changes preceded the change which converted
Jabez trom a Blue-coat boy into Mr. 'Ashton’s apprentice, so

were they anterior to the changes wrought by war in the homes
of the Chadwicks and the Cleggs—changes differing even more
widely than did the two homes.
Poverty had made sad havoc amongst Simon Clegg’s house-
hold goods; but Torn Hulme had not come home empty-
handed, and soon their furniture came back, or was replaced,
and the three rooms brightened up wonderfully. Though
Simon’s ﬂowers brought pence to his pocket as well as the
other produce of his garden, he had always a spare posy for
the broken jug on window-sill or mantelshelf; and Bess, full-
hearted if not full of work, sent her voice quivering through
that unmusical yard in songs of gladness and rejoicing.
Very little fresh wooing was necessary. To people who had
been so stinted as they in common with others had been,
Tom’s pension seemed more than it was ; and no sooner was
be able to discard his sling than he talked of immediate
marriage, and was wonderfully sanguine about obtaining work
as soon as his left arm regained its old power—which it never
did. It was no use setting up a loom; he could no longer
throw the shuttle back. He would have to seek some other
employment. But thousands of other men were seeking em-
ployment too—men with the full use of all their limbs—men
who had not disqualiﬁed themselves for peaceful arts by
“going soldiering ;” and Tom Hulme stood little chance. Mr.
Clough would have taken him on as a timekeeper, but lack of
penmanship was a barrier in the way.
Lamenting this in the presence of Jabez, the youth offered
to be his instructor; and with the permission of Mr. Ashton,
who granted leave of absence, set him copies and gave him
lessons on Sunday afternoons, at ﬁrst on an old slate, to save
the cost of paper, which was clear. And then, at Mr.
Ashton’s suggestion, Jabez superadded arithmetic, thus keeping
himself in practice, besides helping one dear to those who had
helped him.
Of course, a weekly or fortnightly lesson was not much;
but the disabled soldier was a persevering pupil, and brought a
clear head and an eager desire to his task. The maintenance
of a better home for Bess depended on it.
About this time, a matter transpired at the Ashtons’ which
had a material inﬂuence on the fortunes of the Cleggs.
Though the house of Mr. Ashton was in Mosley Street, the
premises extended as far as Back Mosley Street, where was the
warehouse door. The workpeople entered at a side door under a

The Mamﬁesier Man. 115
gateway which led to the stable, gig-house, and courtyard
between house and warehouse, guarded by the black retriever,
Nelson.
You may look in vain for house and warehouse now. A
magniﬁcent block of stone warehouses, having threefold front-
age, occupies the site.
More than once, Jabez Clegg, frequently entrusted with out-
door business requiring promptitude and accuracy, came upon
Kit Townley, and one or other of the tassel-makers or fringe
weavers, in close conference under the dim gateway at closing-
time on Saturdays, or in the still darker doorway at the stair-
foot of the workmen’s entrance. The ﬁrst time they moved
aside to let him pass, afterwards they separated hastily ,' but not
before Jabez, who had quick ears, caught the chink of money
as it passed from one to the other.
On the ﬁrst of these occasions, his attention was barely
arrested ,' it was the repetition and the avoidance which struck
him with its air of secrecy, and set him pondering what busi-
ness his fellow-apprentice could have with the hands out of
proper place and time. He knew him to be not over—scrupulous.
He had seen him at Knott-Mill Fair and Dirt Fair (so called
from its being held in muddy November), or Kersall Moor
Races, with more money to spend in pop, nuts, and ginger
bread, shows and merry-go-rounds, ﬂying boats and ﬂying
boxes, ﬁghting cocks and ﬁghting men, than he could possibly
have saved out of the sum his father allowed him for pocket-
money, even if he had been of the saving kind; and, coupling
all these things together, Jabez was far from satisﬁed. He was
aware that of late years stock-taking had been productive of
much uneasiness to both Mr. and Mrs. Ashton. There were
deﬁciences of raw material in more than one department, for
which it was impossible to account, save that the quantity
accredited to “waste” was far out of reasonable proportion.
Mr. Ashton, suspecting systematic peculation or embezzle-
ment (of which many masters were complaining), had privately
communicated with Joseph Nadin, the deputy constable, a
gnarled graft from Bow Street, who bore the ofﬁcial character
of extraordinary vigilance and smartness. He was supposed to
set a watch on workpeople and others, but nothing came to
light. Perhaps he was too busy manufacturing political
offences, or hunting down political offenders, to look after the
interests of private manufacturers. Sure it is that silk, worsted,
webs, and gingham once gone were not to be traced. Jabez

was also aware that a shade rested on the establishment of
which he was an item, and felt that it behoved him to clear it
away for his own sake, if possible.
Since the discovery of his faculty for design, much of his
time had been occupied at a desk with pencils and colours,
making patterns for the wood-turner, the mould-coverer, the
tassel-maker, the fringe-weaver; for bell-ropes, brace-webs,
carpet and furniture bindings; and although some of these
things admitted but of little variety, there was plenty found for
him to do.
This was well-pleasing enough to Jabez, but the College
ofﬁcials, who never lose sight of the boys they apprentice,
demurred. His indentures provided that he should learn
small—ware-manufacturing in all its branches; and pattern-
designing, if part and parcel, was only one branch. Mr. Ash-
ton was too just not to assent, and Jabez went to his active
employment again. But he had a love for his new art, and an
interest in his master’s interest, which prompted him to say—-
“If it would be all the same to you, sir, I could draw
patterns before breakfast, or in the dinner-hour, or in an even-
ing, if Kezia had someone else to wait on her.”
The inevitable snuff-box came out, Mr. Ashton’s head went
ﬁrst on one side, then on the other, as he took a long pinch
before he answered.
“No, my lad, it won’t be all the same to me, nor to you
either,” he said, at length, and Jabez began to look rueful.
“ You’re a lad of uncommon parts, and I’m willing enough to
ﬁnd them employment. But if you work extra hours, appren-
tice or no apprentice, you must have extra pay. So you see,
Jabez, it won’t be the same to either of us. You shall have
the little room at the end of the lobby to yourself, and there
you may earn all you can for your own friends and for me.”
“Oh, thank you, master!” interjected Jabez, his thoughts
ﬂying at once to the old yard in Long Millgate.
“And let Kezia wait upon herself if there are no other idle
folk about,” concluded Mr. Ashton, and the business was
settled.
This was about the time Jabez ﬁrst began to suspect Kit
Townley of unfair dealing; and being once more in frequent
contact with him in the warehouse, he could not shut his eyes
or his ears. '
Kit was then assistant putter-out in the fringe and tassel de-
partment, counted out the moulds, weighed out silk and

worsted, and called out the quantities each hand took away, for
a young booking-clerk to enter.
' Jabez was still in the brace and umbrella room, but there was
a wide door of communication between the two, and he had
frequently to pass through the former with ﬁnished goods for
the ware and show-rooms on the lower floors, and had to go
cautiously past the large scale, lest he should tilt the beam
with his ungainly burdens. Now and then it occurred to him
that the bulk of silk or worsted in the scale was large in pro-
portion to the weight, as called out by Kit Townley, and once
he was moved to say— i
“ Is that balance true P or have you made a mistake,
Townley P ” ,
“Mind your own business, Clegg, and don’t hinder mine.
Naught ails the scales, and I know better than make mis-
takes.”
“ Well, I only thought,” persisted Jabez.
“ I wish you’d think and keep those umbrellas clear of the
beam. You’re are always thrutching past with great loads on
your shoulder when I am weighing out,” interrupted Kit,
testily, and Jabez held his peace.
But if he went on his way quietly, he was equally observant,
and saw the same thing happen again too often to be the result
of accident. Moreover, from the window of the little room
where he had a broad desk for designing, he saw Kit meet the
same men and women stealthily after hours under the opposite
gateway.
“Kit,” said he, one night, when they went to their attic,
“what do you meet Jackson, Bradley, and Mary Taylor under
the gateway for so often?”
Kit, arrested with his warehouse jacket half on and half off,
asked sharply—
“Who says I meet them under the gateway?”
“ I say so. I have seen you myself.”
“ And what if you have P ” Kit retorted, snappishly.
“There’s no harm in saying a civil word to poor folk that I
know of.”
“ N0 harm, if that were all,” returned Jabez, seriously, sitting
down on the edge of his truckle-bed to take off his blue
worsted stockings (knitted by himself), “but I have seen them
give you money.”
“And what of that, you Blue-coat spy ! If they’re kind
enough to call at old mother Clowes’s shop for toﬁ'y and hum-

bugs for me, and give me the change back, what’s that to
you?” he blustered, coming up to Jabez with a deﬁant air.
“ I know you’ve a sweet tooth, Townley,” replied Jabez, un~
moved, “but I fear nothing half so good as Mrs. Clowes’ toffy
takes you there so stealthily.”
“Perhaps, Mr. Wiseacre, you know my business better than
,myself P ” returned Kit, bold as brass, though he did begin to
feel qualmish. ,
“Perhaps I do, for I suspect you of double~dealing, and I
know what the end of that must be; and I warn you that I
cannot stand by and see our good master robbed. I should
be as bad as you if I did.” .
Townley, enraged, struck at him, and there was a scuﬂie in
the dark, the bit of candle in their horn lantern having burnt
out.
Kezia, who slept in the adjoining attic, rated them soundly
the next morning for the disturbance they had made, threaten-
ing to tell Mrs. Ashton. Had she done so, inquiry would have
followed. 1
Jabez, troubled and perplexed, the very next Sunday, con-
sulted old Simon Clegg as to the course he should pursue, being
alike unwilling to tell tales on suspicion, or to see his kind
master wronged. .
“ Eh, lad,” quoth Simon, rubbing down his knees as he sat,
“aw’ve manny a toime bin i’ just sich a ‘ strait atween two ;’
but aw allas steered moi coorse by you big book, and tha’ mun
do t’ seame. Thah munnot think what thah loikes, or what
thah dunnot loike 3 but thah mun do reef, chuse what comes or
goes. It is na reet to steeal ; and to look on an’ consent to a
thief is to be a thief. Thi ﬁrst duty’s to thi God, an’ thi next
to thi payrents (if tha’ had anny), an’ thi next to thi measter.
Thah’s gi’en the chap fair warnin’, an’ if he wunnot tak’ it th’
faut’s noan thoine.”
It so happened that the “ putter-out ” in the brace and um-
brella—room was an old man named Christopher, who had been
in the employment of the Ashtons (father and son) for thirty
years. He professed to be very pious and very conscientious,
but lamented that increasing years brought with it many ail-
ments and inﬁrmities, such, for instance, as headaches, dizzi-v
ness, sudden weakness of the limbs, and attacks of spasms,
for the cure of which he kept a bottle of peppermint in a
corner cupboard.
It was into this room Augusta used to come dancing, to

coax old Christopher out of bits of waste leather, and other
odds and ends, for which onlya child could ﬁnd use. She
was fond of cutting and snipping, and, with an eye to his own
advantage, the cunning old fellow had taught her how to use
the stamps, so that she might amuse herself by helping him.
Then he bespoke her compassion for his aches and pains, and
often, on holiday-afternoons, was troubled with one or other
ailment, which a pull at the bottle and a nap on the bundles of
leather, or gingham, alone could relieve—“ if Miss Augusta
would be so obleeging an’ so koind as to stamp out a few tabs
or straps for him, or count out umbrella ferules, or wheels, or
handles,” for him.
And she, full of the superabundant energy of youth, did it,
nothing loth; though as her own years increased, and with
them her ability to help, came a sharp sense that old Christo-
pher was a hypocrite—knowledge she conﬁded to Jabez one
day, when the sanctimonious putter-out was resting his aching
head and uncertain legs, as usual; and in order to convince
him she drew a bottle of gin, not peppermint, from under a pile
of white kid.
Jabez, too, had been sorry for the old fellow, and often added
agood part of Christopher’s work to his own, to relieve him.
It was this fact which brought both Christophers to book. The
old cant was so grievoust afflicted on the Monday afternoon,
that Jabez, seeing him quite incapable of doing his work
properly (he' was putting out umbrellas), undertook to do it for
him, though it was no business of his—and so Mrs. Ashton
would have told him, had she been there.
He measured off what he knew to be sufﬁcient gingham for
two dozen umbrellas (a workwoman standing by in waiting),
and was about to cut off the length when the woman arrested
his hand.
“Yo’re furgettin’ th’ weaste, mi lad; Mester Christopher
' allus alleaws fur weaste.”
He looked at the woman, conscious there could be no waste
in cutting umbrella-gores. She winked at him.
“Oh,” said Jabez, conscious he was learning something not
down in his indentures. “ And how much does he allow P”
“ Abeawut a yard an’ a hauve th’ dozen,” she replied.
“ And how do you contrive to waste it P” Jabez asked.
She winked again.
“ Eh, but yo’re a young yorney. Yo’d best ax Mester Chris-
topher that.”

“ I think I’d best ask Mrs. Ashton that, if she’s in the ware-
house,” rejoined he, sending his scissors through the gingham
at the proper place.
“ Yo’d better not, or yo’n cut off yo’r nose to spite yo’r own
feace 5” and the woman nodded her head knowingly. “T’other
’prentice knows whatn weaste means if thah dunnot 3 an’
manny’s th’ breet shillin’ it’s put in his breeches pocket, my
lad.” '
“ Oh, that’s it, is it P” said Jabez, whilst he was counting over
the already bundled up whalebone sticks, &c., to complete the
umbrella ﬁttings. “ As our mistress would say, ‘ We may live
and learn.’ ”
He found that whalebone, ferules, handles, leathers, wheels,
were all in excess. An extra umbrella might be made from the
superabundant materials. Thereupon he wakened Christopher '
to do his own work, simply remarking that he thought the
bundles of sticks, &c., had been miscounted.
“Oh, no, Clegg, they’re a’ reet; we’re obleeged to put in
moore fur fear some on ’em shouldn’ split in makkin’ 00p,”
said old Christopher, cunningly, as if for his information.
Jabez took no further notice then, but shouldering a great
bundle of large umbrellas, carried them through the fringe
room. and there noticed that, despite the caution he had given,
his fellow-apprentice was dexteriously manipulating silk and
scales to falsify the weights he called out.

CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.
EASTER MONDAY.
HAT evening Jabez, a clear-eyed, open-browed youth in
his seventeenth year, upright, well-knit, and ﬁrmly built
for his age, knocked at the parlour-door after Miss Augusta
had been sent to bed. There was some trouble on his coun-
tenance, as though he was bent on an errand utterly repugnant
to him. He was truly sorry to be the means, however re-
motely, of bringing disgrace on both an old man and a young
one; but Simon had led him to the conclusion that if there
was little honour in turning informer, there would be absolute
dishonesty in keeping silence whilst he saw his master robbed.
Yet he hesitated, and lingered with his hand on the handle
of the door, after the clear voice of Mr. Ashton had twice
invited him to “ come in.”
Mr. Ashton therefore opened the door, and saw Jabez with
a design for a bell-rope tassel in his hand.
“Well, Jabez, what is it? Something special you have to
show us?”
“ No, sir ; I only brought this lest any of the servants
should be curious about my errand here."
Mrs. Ashton, who was reading a romance from Mrs. Edge’s
circulating library in King Street, lifted up her head at this;
and Jabez came in, closing the door.
“Then what is the errand which needs such precaution P”
asked Mr. Ashton, resuming his seat and looking up at the
clear face of Jabez.
“I think, sir "—and he laid an emphasis on the “think "—
“I have found out how you are being robbed, and who it is
that robs you.”
“ You—what?” exclaimed Mr. Ashton, placing his hand on
the elbows of his chair, and bending forward inquiringly.


## p. 122 (#134) ############################################

122 The Manehesz‘er Man.
Jabez repeated his statement, adding, “I think, sir, some
of your putters-out and work-people are in league to defraud
you.”
Out came Mr. Ashton’s snuff-box, down went Mrs. Ashton’s
romance, whilst Jabez told succinctly how his suspicions had
been ﬁrst aroused, and how they had been conﬁrmed that day.
“I did not tell my suspicions to Christopher, sir, thinking
I had best not interfere, or put the—the—them on their
guard until I had spoken to you. I feared lest I should defeat
your plans,” said Jabez, modestly.
“Just so, Jabez, just so ,' you were quite right, Jabez,” said
his master, whilst a shower of snuff fell on neckcloth ends and
shirt frills.
“Yes, quite right!” assented Mrs. Ashton, with customary
dignity. “ ‘ A still tongue shows a wise head 5’ but we seldom
see an old head on such young shoulders.”
No active steps were taken for a few days, but Mrs. Ashton
was in the warehouse, and doubly observant ; and Mr. Ashton
was also on the alert. They saw enough to convince them
that Jabez was correct, and, acting on ﬁrst impulses, Nadin
was again communicated with.
From the window of Jabez Clegg’s little room, Kit Townley
was seen to receive payment from a fringe-weaver for his share
of the spoil; and then Nadin, who knew all about it quite
well enough before, followed up the clue to a waste-dealer’s
who bought at his own price workpeople’s “ waste” (lie, warp,
weft, silk, &c., remaining after work was completed), and found
tradespeople willing enough to repurchase, well knowing that
commodities so varied, and so far below market value, were
not honestly come by.
Nadin, big and blustering when there was nothing to be
gained by silence, was for hauling the whole lot off to prison
—the two Kits, the waste dealer, and sundry workpeople—and
the criminal code was a very terrible dispensation then.
But Mr. Ashton was more merciful ; he was for milder
measures. Besides, Mr. Townley was an old friend of his,
and for the sake of the father he forbore to drag the son into a
court of justice; and unless he prosecuted all, he could not
prosecute any.
The sight of Nadin and his rough men, in their red-cuffed,
red-collared brown coats, with their staves and handcuffs ready
for use was sufﬁciently terrifying. The distress of old Mr.
Townley was painful to witness. As for Kit himself, he seemed

The Manchesien Man. 123
less conscious of his guilt than ashamed of being found out,
openly declaring that he “did no mere than was customary,”
and no more than old Christopher, who had led him into it,
had done for years.
That old hypocrite went down on his knees with many
whining protestations of his innocence ; but, ﬁnding proof too
strong, he made a clean breast of it, and on learning that
through the generosity of his employer he was about to escape
prosecution, which would have led to transportation, he begged
piteously to be allowed to retain the situation he had held for
so many years.
“ N 0, Kit,” said Mrs. Ashton 3 “ ‘there is no rogue like an
old rogue ," you have not only robbed us yourself, but taught
others the trick. Think well you have escaped the New
Bailey ” (the Manchester and Salford prison).
At that period the constable who apprehended a criminal
received a bonus on each conviction, called “blood-money ”
so large a proportion of felons were executed; and Nadin,
gruff and uncourteous even to his superiors, was disposed to
resist Mr. Ashton’s amiable “interference with the course of
justice.” A liberal douceur from the elder Mr. Townley’s well-
stocked purse was potent to allay his zeal. His runners were
dismissed, and his friend the waste-dealer had a longer lease.
The clearance of rogues paved the way for honest men,
besides suggesting measures to prevent like embezzlement in
future. The Ashtons rightly thought that the best way to
reward Jabez was to serve his friends. A situation as
putter-out to the weavers was offered to Tom Hulme, Mr.
Ashton having had his eye on him for some time; and old
Simon, being sent for, went home delighted with commenda-
tions of Jabez, and the consciousness that the only barrier to-
Bess’s marriage was now removed, and that through the
foundling’s instrumentality.
The only bar, that is, save the double fees of Lent, and
the “ill-luck” supposed to follow a couple united during
the penitential forty days. Tom put up the banns, however,
and Easter Monday was chosen as the day of days for the
ceremony. Tom Hulme’s parents had been married on an
Easter Monday, Simon. had been tied to his wife on an
Easter Monday, Jabez had been made a Blue-coat boy on
an Easter Monday, and apprenticed on an Easter Monday;
it was consequently an anniversary to be observed and respected.
Early marriages prevail amongst the class made early self-

dependent by earning their own living. Matt Cooper had
long been a grandfather, Molly and his two eldest boys had
been married and settled. A brisk young butcher coming to
the tannery with hides had met Martha, the other girl, bearing
her father’s dinner, and been so taken with her sharp, active
gait, and saucy answers, that he proposed to transfer her to his
shop beyond Ancoats Lane Canal-bridge, and to make his offer
more palatable, suggested an amalgamation of the two house-
holds, and to take the youngest lad—Matthew, aged fourteen
—as his apprentice.
So ardent and promising a lover was not to be despised.
Martha did not say “No,” and Matt, beginning to stoop in
the shoulders, rejoiced at the prospective haven for his declin<
ing years.
It was arranged that they should be married along with Bess
and Tom Hulme; and so Matthew Cooper went with the
Cleggs to church, not as a gallant bridegroom, but, more suit-
ably, to give away a bride.
And now how shall I describe the scene at the Old Church
on Easter Monday, to convey anything like an idea to modern
readers, unacquainted with the locality, the period, and the
habits of the people?
It must be borne in mind that registrars’ ofﬁces did not
exist; that there was no marrying at dissenting chapels; that
few, if any, churches were licensed for the solemnisation 0t
matrimony; and that the collegiate parish church of Man-
chester was the nucleus towards which the marriageable in-
habitants of all the surrounding townships and villages turned
at the most important epoch of their lives.
The venerable pile (now being doctored by restorers) was
set, as it were, in a ring-fence of old houses, with an inner ring
of low wall encircling the churchyard, which, as grave-stones
testiﬁed, had once extended to the very house-steps. As I have
elsewhere said, the path between this wall and the houses was
known as Half Street, a portion of which, containing Mrs.
Clowes’s old shop, still remains ; and did I enumerate all the
public-houses in this ring-fence which offered accommodation
to wedding and christening parties, only a future generation of
antiquaries would thank me; and even they might doubt the
facts set down in a work of ﬁction.
Nevertheless on Easter Monday not one of these hostelries
had a spare foot of room. Every window and every door
stood wide open. Men and women, gaily dressed as their own

means or friendly wardrobes would allow, went in and out,
ﬁlled rooms and passages, leaned from the windows with
ribbons ﬂying loose, or with pipes and ale-pots in their hands,
calling to their friends below, whilst rival ﬁddlers (almost every
party having its own) scraped away in anything but harmony.
Horses and carts blocked up every avenue, and the churchyard
itself was thronged with an excited crowd.
Only the parties immediately interested were admitted into
the sacred ediﬁce, but to reach the doors they had to force
their way, and could only return in couples through a dense
avenue of humanity, amid a shower of jests, many not the most
seemly.
Bess wore only a white cambric gown, and a straw bonnet
crossed with white ribbon, both of which Mrs. Ashton had
provided ; but somewhere in Tom’s Peninsular campaigns he
had picked up a bright-coloured scarf, which made her glorious
to behold, and the envy of many a country bride. His old
uniform had been kept for the occasion, and they looked grand
together, but the quiet content on Bess’s face was better than
the grandeur.
Nat Bradshaw, the butcher-bridegroom, was of a jovial turn,
and nothing would do but the whole double wedding-party,
Jabez included, should turn into the Ring-o’-Bells to drink
health and happiness to the brides, and give them spirit to go
through the ceremony beﬁttingly. Bess and Martha hung back
blushing like peonies ; but Nathaniel was not to be gainsaid,
and in they went : and whilst the brides sipped, he quaffed,
and pressed the others to do likewise. '
At length Jabez, who had been brought up temperately,
cried out they would be too late—Parson Brookes had been
gone into the church half-an-hour.
There was a general rush from the room, and in the scramble
to get ﬁrst the party got separated ; Matthew pulling his
daughter along and leaving the bridegroom to follow. They
elbowed their way into the church, and reached the choir just
as Joshua pronounced the benediction over some twenty
couples closely packed around the altar. Then there was a
jostle and a scramble for “ﬁrst kisses,” amidst which rose the
rough voice of the chaplain.
“ Now clear out, clear out ! Do your kissing outside.
There are other folks waiting to be wed. Do you think I want
to be kept here all day tying up fools P ”
That instalment of the married having been hustled away to

sign the church backs, with their attendant witnesses, Joshua
called out impatiently to the waiting couples, amongst which
were Bess and Tom—
“ Come, come I How long do you mean to keep me stand-
ing here? Do you intend to be married or not? Oh, it’s
thee, is it? [to Bess] Well, thah’s waited long enough—See
that you make her a good husband [to Tom]. Kneel down
here,” and he placed them, not roughly, almost in the centre
of the altar, pulling others to their knees beside them, with
scant ceremony.
“ What do yau want here P ” in his harshest tones he asked a
very youthful-looking couple.
“ To be wed,” was the prompt answer of the young man.
“ Ugh l” grunted the Parson, “what’s the world coming to?
I used to marry men and women—now I marry children !
Here, you silly babies, take your places.”
Another ﬁle of candidates for matrimony being ranged (after
some pushing and pulling) in pairs around the altar, Joshua took
his book and the service began. '
So long as it was general, all we t tolerably smoothly—
women and men alike were too bashfu and confused to know
much what was said, or what they responded, and certainly
they rarely looked in each other’s faces. At length there was
a slight stir and a whispering from the quarter where Matt
Cooper stood beside his daughter.
“ Silence there ! ” roared Joshua, in a voice which set a row
of hearts in a ﬂutter, and there was silence.
But he had come to the troth-plight, and again the same
commotion was apparent as he approached the Coopers.
“ What’s wrong here? ” he demanded, pausing before
Martha, who was all in a tremble.
“ Moi lass is waitin’ fur her mon,” answered Matthew from
behind.
“ Ugh I I can’t wait for laggards.—Here, you, [addressing
Torn Hulme,] answer for him.—What’s his name P ” [to

Martha].
“ Nathaniel,” she; faltered.
“I, Nathaniel, take thee, Martha, to be my ” he went
on, insisting on thelresponse of Tom, who looked aghast at
the prospect of marrying the wrong woman, and being told “ to
pair as they went out,” as Joshua had summarily adjusted at
like mistake heretofore; or what was worse, of being saddled
with two wives.

The Manchester Man. 12 7
On imperturbable Joshua went with the ceremony, bent on a
marriage by proxy. His experience having taught him that
women of the working class as a_rule took charge of their wed-
ding-rings, he asked Martha for hers, which was duly produced,
and without further ado he directed Tom Hulme to place it on
Martha’s ﬁnger, as he had previously put one on Bess’s, and
with the same formula.
They had got as far as “ With this ring I thee wed,” when
the missing bridegroom came in hot haste through the side
door into the chancel, closely followed by Jabez, who had been
in quest of him.
He was ﬂushed with ale and excitement, but was clear-
headed enough to perceive what was going forward, and to the
chaplain’s chagrin, plucked the young woman back from the
altar and his proxy, and the ring rolled to the ground.
Then ensued an altercation between the butcher and Joshua
Brookes, the latter insisting that what was good enough for
princes might be good enough for him, and refusing to go over
the ceremony again. But an apparitor drew the tardy bride-
groom aside, and whispered to him a few mollifying words,
whilst Joshua concluded the ceremonial, and then hurried from
the altar with hardly a look at either Jabez on Simon as he
passed out of the chancel, chafed and angry. Another clergy-
man took his place, and in the next group Nat Bradshaw and
the half-married Martha took theirs. The lost ring had a sub-
stitute provided by the clerk for such emergencies; and this
time they were as surely married as Bess and Tom had been.
Jabez had found the truant bridegroom at the “ Ring-01
Bells,” oblivious of the ﬂight of time, or of his party. The
story having got wind, there was a general rush in their direc
tron.
‘ " Here’s th’ mon wur too late to be wed l ”—“ Tak’ care thi
woife hasna two husbants ! ”—“ Hoo’s getten two husbants
o’ready l ”——“ See thah’s tied oop gradely, lass ! ”—“ Thah’rt a
pratty fellow !” and much more which might have provoked a
man less good-humoured in his cups.
As it was the new brides clung to their husbands, narf afraid
of those noisy demonstrations, and were not sorry to get clear
of the crowd, and thread their way to Ancoats Lane, where the
thriving butcher, assisted by Mrs.'_ Ashton, Mrs. Clowes, and
Mrs. Clough, had prepared a dinner which bore no proportion
to the “ short commons” of every-day fare.

CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.
PETERLOO.
' EOPLE had been naturally sanguine that the conclusion
of peace would inaugurate prosperity, that commerce
would ﬂourish with the ﬂourish of pens on the parchments of a
treaty. But the war had been of too long continuance, too
universal, too destructive of life and property and crops, When
grounds lie untilled for years ; when swords reap harvests that
should have been left for the sickle ,' when cattle are slaughtered
wholesale for unproductive soldiery, or for lack of provender ;
when orchards and vineyards which have taken years to mature
are given to the ﬂames, there can be no sudden re-adjustment
of commercial matters. Food-products are the staple of trade,
which is only a system of exchange facilitated by coin and
paper.
What could a food-producing continent, down-trod by the
iron hoof of war, have to offer in exchange for our textile fa-
brics and hardware?
Trade could not revive, until there was food to sustain it.
Yet the mass of the people in 1816, still further impoverished
‘by a deﬁcient home harvest,_imputed the evil to defective legis-
lation, and the exclusion of foreign corn save at famine prices ;
and discontent became universal.
Strangely enough, the agricultural districts which the Corn
Laws were supposed to protect, were the ﬁrst to cry out against
them, and to break out into ri’ot—not Manchester, Oldham,
Nottingham, and the manufacturing centres.
This year closed on a popular demand for Parliamentary re-
form, but not a riotous one. Sunday schools had created
readers on humble hearths, and William Cobbett supplied
them with books and pamphlets bearing on their own rights
and wrongs. They were read with avidity, and he became a
power. He counselled peaceful persistence, not armed resist-

ance. Hampden Clubs were formed all over the country, in
which the political questions of the day were discussed with as
much freedom as stringent law permitted. Public speakers
and poets, of whom Samuel Bamford was one, arose from the
ranks of the working classes; and the men banded together
under such leadership called themselves Radical Reformers, a
title which soon degenerated into Radicals.
The members of these rapidly-spreading clubs subscribed a
penny a week each. Delegates were sent to meet and debate
together ; and on the 4th November, 1816, a large meeting was
held in St. Peter’s Field, Manchester (strangely enough, the
site of the present Free Trade Hall), “to take into considera-
tion the distressed state of the country.”
Other meetings were held by the Reformers and their
delegates; and on the 13th January, 1817, their political
opponents held a counter-meeting, to consider the “ necessity
of adopting measures for the maintenance of the public
peace ;” for certainly the meeting of large masses of disaffected
people, however peacefully disposed in the outset, and indi-
vidually, becomes threatening in the aggregate. No one cares
much for a grain of gunpowder; but mass the grains into
pounds, and the pounds into tons, and there is certainly need
of precaution in dealing with it. _
Amongst the precautionary measures deemed necessary for
the protection of the peace, and the suppression of seditious
meetings, were the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and
the enrolment of the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry
Cavalry, under the command of Sir T. J. Traﬂ'ord ; Laurence
Aspinall, Ben Travis, and John Walmsley joining the corps.
On the 24th of March—since known as Blanket Monday—a
large number of men assembled in St. Peter’s Field, with
blankets upon their shoulders, with the openly-expressed
design of walking to London, to lay their grievances before
George, the Prince Regent, in person. The blankets were
intended for coverlets on the wayside beds Mother Earth
alone would spread for them. The meeting was dispersed by
military, the newly-formed Yeomanry distinguishing themselves
by trapping a number of the Blanketeers who had prematurely
set out, and who had not got farther than Stockport.
This was the signal for widespread alarm, and for Joseph
Nadin to prove his discrimination and vigilance by scenting
out imaginary plots, and arresting suspected plotters, whom
be tied together, handcuffed, ill-used, and hauled to prison, or

before magistrates (whether for acquittal or conviction), for
little other reason than the dangerous power given by the sus-
pension of the Habeas Corpus. He was a big, blustering,
overbearing fellow, with a large grizzled head, closely set on
strong broad shoulders, with overhanging brows drawn close,
and a sallow skin _; and his ofﬁcious zeal in arresting such
persons as Samuel Bamford the weaver-poet, Thomas Walker,
and the amateur actors he laid hands on at a publichouse in
Ancoats-lane, laying to their charge plots which had their origin
in his own brain, did more to embitter the people against their
rulers than those dust-blinded rulers suspected.
The Radical agitation reached its climax in 1819, when our
friend Jabez was a well-formed, well-favoured young man of
twenty, high in the estimation of his master and mistress.
Popular rights had found a fresh champion in Henry Hunt, the
son of a well-descended Wiltshire yeoman, a man of gentle-
manlike bearing and attire, agreeable features mobile in ex»
pression, and dull grey eyes which lit like ﬁery stars when in ,
the fervour of his speech his soul shone out of them.
“ Orator Hunt,” as he was ironically dubbed by those who
loved him not, was the very man to move the people as he
himself was moved; his energy and fervid eloquence carried
his hearers with him, and as he was wont to lash himself to a
fury which streaked his pale eyes with blood, and forced them
forward in their sockets, no wonder the Manchester magnates
were afraid of his inﬂuence on the multitude, or that the
Prince Regent should issue a proclamation against seditious
meetings and writings, or the military drilling of the populace,
then carried on with so fervid an orator to inﬂame them.
When Henry Hunt made a public entry into Manchester,
and attended the theatre the same evening, a disturbance en-
sued, and he was expelled, and the next evening the theatre
was closed, to preserve peace. Then a Watch-and-Ward, com-
‘ posed of the chief inhabitants, was established ; a meeting
called by the Radicals was prohibited; but that did not deter
the calling of another on St. Peter’s Field, on the 16th of
August, when a couple of large waggons were boarded over to
serve as temporary hustings, whence Orator Hunt from- the
midst of his friends might address the assembled multitude.
Augusta Ashton had just passed her ﬁfteenth birthday. She
was slim, graceful, and tall beyond her age, and was surpassing
lovely. She was still under Mrs. Broadbent’s care, and went
to school that morning as usual, other meetings having passed

off quietly, and no apprehension of disorder being entertained
until long after nine o’clock.
About that hour the people began to assemble from all
quarters on the open ground near St. Peter’s Church—not
bloodthirsty roughs, but men, women, and children, drawn
thither for a sight of a holiday spectacle. ,True, of the collec-
tive eighty thousand, though there were many thousands of
earnest, thinking men whe went to grapple wtth important
questions, yet no such mighty gathering could be without its
leaven of savagery and mischief.
But those who went from the mills and the workshops, the
hills and the valleys around Manchester, walking in procession,
with bugles playing and gay banners ﬂying, though they might
look haggard” pinched and careworn, made no attempt to look
deplorable, or excite compassion. They wore their Sunday
suits and clean neckties ; and by the side of fustian and cor-
duroy walked the coloured prints and stuffs of wives and sweet-
hearts, who went as for a gala-day, to break the dull monotony
of their lives, and to serve as a guarantee of peaceable
intention. ,
Such at least was the main body, marshalled in Middleton
by stalwart, stout hearted Samuel Bamford, which passed in
marching order, ﬁve abreast, down Newton Lane, through Old-
ham Street, skirted the Inﬁrmary Gardens, and along Mosley
Street, each leader with a sprig of peaceful laurel in his hat.
Women and little ones preceded them, or ran on the footway,
singing, dancing, shouting gleefully in the bright sunshine, as
at any other pageant to which the music of the bugle gave life
and spirit, and waving ﬂags gave colour.
Such too were the bands which, with banners and music, fell
in with them on their route, and together parted the dense
multitude as a wedge, on their way to the decorated platform.
Thence Samuel Bamford observed that other leaders had been
less temperate. There were to be seen black banners and
placards inscribed with seditious mottoes and emblems: caps
of liberty, skull and crossbones, “Bread or Blood,” “ Liberty
or Death,” “Equal Representation or Death ,- ” this last with
an obverse of clasped hands and heart, and the sine word
“ Love,” but all of the same funereal black and white.
But ere he could well note or deplore this, the scattered
bands struck up “God save the King,” and “ Rule, Britannia,”
deafening shouts rent the air, and Henry Hunt, drawn in an
open barouche by white horses, made his way slowly to the

hustings amidst the enthusiastic cheering of the multitude. A
Mrs. Fildes, arrayed in white, with a cap of liberty on her head,
and a red cap borne on a pole before her, sat on the box-seat.
It is said she had been hoisted there from the crowd. Be
this as it may, she paid dearly for her temerity before the day
was out. _
Barely had Henry Hunt ascended the platform, taken off his
white hat, and begun to address his attentive auditory, when
there was a startling cry, “The soldiers are upon us! ” and the
I 5th Hussars, galloping round a corner, came with their spare
jackets ﬂying loose, their sabres drawn, and threw themselves
men and horse, upon the closely-packed mass, without a note
of warning. All had been preconcerted, pre-arranged.
From the early morning, magistrates had been sitting in
conclave at the ‘\‘ Star Inn,” and there Hugh Birley, a cotton-
spinner, was said to have regaled too freely the ofﬁcers and
men of his yeomanry corps, so soon to be let loose on the
“ swinish multitude,” as they called them.
A cordon of military and yeomanry had been drawn round
St Peter’s Field, like a horde of wolves round a ﬂock of sheep.
The boroughreeve and other magistrates issued their orders
from a house at the corner of Mount Street, which overlooked
the scene; and thence (not from a central position, where he
could be properly seen and heard) a clerical magistrate read
the Riot Act from a window in an inaudible voice.
Then Nadin, the cowardly bully, having a warrant to appre~
bend the ringleaders—although he had a line of constables
thence to the hustings,—declared he dared not serve it without
the support of the military.
His plea was heard; and thus, through the blindness, the
incapacity, the cowardice, or the self-importance of this one man,
soldiery hardened in the battle-ﬁeld, yeomanry ﬁred with drink,
were let loose like'barbarians on a closely-wedged mass of un-
armed people, and one of the most atrocious massacres in
history was the result. '
Amid the shouts and shrieks of men and women, cries of
“ Shame l shame !” “ Break l break ! ” “They are killing them
in front ! ” “Break ! break !” hussars, infantry, yeomanry
rushed on the defenceless people. They were sabred, stabbed,
shot, pressed down, trampled down by horse and infantry ; and
in less than ten minutes, the actual ﬁeld was cleared of all but
mounds of dead and dying, severed limbs, torn garments, pools
of blood, pawing steeds and panting heroes (P). Men and

maidens, mothers and babes, had been butchered by their own
countrymen for no crime. .
Hunt had been taken, Bamford had escaped—to be arrested
afterwards—and Mrs. Fildes, hanging suspended by a nail in
the platform which had caught her white dress, was slashed
across her exposed body by one of the brave cavalry.
But the butchery and the panic had spread from the deserted
Aceldama over the whole town 3 and the roar of cannon began
to add its thunder to the terrors of the day. As the ﬁrst
shrieking fugitives rushed for their lives down Mosley Street,
with the Manchester and- Cheshire Yeomanry in swift pursuit,
Mrsl Ashton, for the ﬁrst time alarmed for the safety of
Augusta, hurried through the warehouse in search of Mr. Ash-
ton, who was nowhere to be found. On the stairs she met
Jabez in a state of equal excitement. '
“ Miss Augusta ! Is she at school P Had I not
better ”
“ Oh, yes ! Run ! run 1” cried the mother, anticipating him.
“ Go through the back streets, and take her to her aunt’s. It
is not safe to bring her home.”
He was gone before she concluded. (His master’s daughter
was the very light of his young eyes). From Back Mosley
Street he tore down Rook Street and Meal Street, into Foun—
tain Street, across Market Street—already in a ferment—and
onward down High Street without a pause.
By good fortune he met the young girl and a school-fellow,
on their usual homeward route, at the corner of Church Street,
almost afraid to proceed, the distant ﬁring had so scared
them.
“ This way, this way, Miss Ashton ! ” was his impetuous cry,
as he hurried them from the main thoroughfare (into which a
stream of terror-stricken people was ﬂowing), through by-streets,
and a long entry to the back door of Mr. Chadwick’s house,
which they found unfastened; and then he thanked God in
his heart of hearts that she at least was safe.
Upstairs rushed Augusta, followed by her friend, in search
of her aunt and cousin, whom she found in the drawing-room
in a state of the greatest trepidation and alarm.
Dolly, a stout woman-servant, had gone to Fountain Street,
as was her custom, to assist her paralysed master home to
dinner. From the windows they had seen men, women, and
children ﬂying along, hatless, bonnetless, shoeless, their clothes
' rent, their faces livid and ghastly, cut and bleeding, shnekrng

in pain and terror as they ran or dropped in the path of pursu-
ing troopers ; and their hearts throbbed wildly with affright as
they pictured that helpless old man caught in that whirlpool of
horror and destruction with only a woman’s arm to protect
him.
“Jabez will go and meet them,” cried Augusta; “he is
below !”
“Jabez l” exclaimed Ellen, starting to her feet, her white
face ﬂushed for a brief moment. “ Oh, no !”
But without waiting to hear her cousin’s exclamation, or to
note her change of colour, Augusta had run downstairs to
Jabez, waiting in the long kitchen, and communicated her
aunt’s fears to him.
Personal danger was unthought of when Augusta Ashton
pointed to needful service. The lobby door closed after him
with a bang before she had well explained her wishes; and
when Augusta re-appeared in the drawing-room, Ellen Chad-
wick’s head was stretched from the window, watching the
sturdy young man stem the on-rushing tide of humanity—the
only one in all that crowd with his face turned towards the
danger from which the rest ﬂed in desperation.
The sights and sounds that met her eyes and ears were
terrible: gashed faces and mained limbs; appeals and impre-
cations mingled with the roar of a surging crowd ; the dropping
ﬁre of musketry; the coarse shouts of the yeomanry, drunk
with wine and blood ! i
As her fearful eyes followed Jabez, a man rushed past whOse
hand had been chopped off at the wrist. With the remaining
hand he held his hat to catch the vital stream which gushed
from the bleeding stump ; and as he ran, he cried, “ Blood for
blood ! blood for blood !” in a tone which made her shudder.
Faint and sick, she drew back her head; but open appre-
hension for her dear father, and secret fear for the apprentice
who had gone so readily to pilot him through that surging
human sea, caused her to look forth once more. Augusta and
her friend, with blanched cheeks and lips, were also at the
window, fascinated as it were with that which chilled them.
Jabez turned the corner into Piccadilly, where one or two
good houses had been converted into shops without lowering
the ﬂoors, or removing the original palisades, which enclosed
bold ﬂights of steps leading to doors with good shop-windows
on each side. A confectioner of some standing named
Mabbott occupied the second of these. He and his neigh-

hour were hurriedly putting up their shutters as Jabez, crushing
his way through the thickening crowd, saw Molly and Mr.
Chadwick jammed up against the palisades, a young mounted
yeomanry ofﬁcer, in all his pride of blue and silver, brandish-
ing his sabre, urging his unwilling steed upon them, and
shouting—
“ Move on, you rebels, move on ! or I’ll cut you down I”
Strong of nerve and will, Jabez thrust the impending throng
aside, and grasped the horse’s reins to force it back, crying as
he did so—
“Shame, you coward! to attack a woman and a paralysed
man ! ”
“ Come in here, quick, Mr. Chadwick i” cried Mr. Mabbott
at that instant, opening his closed gate and drawing the feeble
gentleman and his attendant within, as the sabre, raised either
to terrify or strike the old man, came down on the outstretched
arm of Jabez, gashing it frightfully.
Another of the corps riding past, with his eyes full upon
them, stopped his horse at the gallop as if to interpose, but he
was too late.
“ My God I Aspinall, what have you done ? ” he exclaimed,
and throwing his own reins over the palisades, he dismounted
hastily, caught at Jabez, who had staggered back, and drew
him too within the iron screen, and helped- him also into the
confectioner’s, as the other, with a derisive laugh which ill-be-
came his handsome face, turned at a hand-gallop up Oldham
Street, where he overtook a amfrere, and with him sneered at
“that soft-hearted Ben Travis.”
Ellen and Augusta had not lost sight of Jabez many minutes
when two of the Manchester Yeomanry, their dripping sabres
ﬂashing in the August sun, wheeled their panting chargers
round, and rode (heedless of the shrinking wretches beneath
their hoofs) across the footway, and made the brute beasts rear
and plunge against the area-rails.
“ Shut your windows, or we’ll ﬁre upon you !” they shouted.
Nothing daunted, Ellen called back indignantly—
“John Walmsley, I’m ashamed of you 1”
Not sober enough to distinguish friends from foes, again the
pair launched their threat, “ Shut the window, or we ﬁre 1”
and Ellen, seeing pistols advanced, drew the window down,
Mrs. Chadwick in much trepidation closing the other.
“ Who was that handsome ofﬁcer with John P ” asked
Augusta, as they drew back, “ he’s a perfect Adonis.” (Augusta

dipped surreptitiously into Mrs. Edge’s novels at times, and a.
handsome man in uniform was, of course, a hero in her eyes).
“Oh, Augusta, how can you talk of handsome ofﬁcers at
such a fearful time?” remonstrated Ellen. “I think them
hideous, every one! ”
“ But who is he? Do you know him P” she asked, even
through the tears drawn by the scenes she beheld.
“Oh, yes; know him? yes. He’s a friend of John
Walmsley. He’s too wild to please either Charlotte or me 1—
Oh, mother! I do wish father had come home!” and Ellen
turned a worried look towards Mrs. Chadwick, whose rigid face
and clasped hands betrayed the anxiety which kept her silent.
Augusta, though not naturally void of feeling, longed to
know more of the handsome yeomanry ofﬁcer who had so cap-
tivated her young fancy ; but that was not the season for such
inquiries, and she was conscious of it.
“Hark! what is that?” burst from Mrs. Chadwick, some-
half-hour later, as the sound of feet was heard from below; and
Ellen, rushing to the stairs, came back followed by her father
leaning on the arm of a big muscular man, in the blue and
silver uniform of the yeomanry cavalry, a red cord down his
pantaloons, hessian boots, and, to make assurance sure,
M.Y.C. upon the shako which his height compelled him to
doﬁ' ere he entered the doorway.
“Where is Jabez Clegg P” faltered Ellen, as she pressed to
her father’s side, led him to his chair, and placed his cushions
to his liking, Augusta bringing a buffet on which to rest his
foot.
The stalwart young fellow’s eyes followed the attentive
daughter, as he answered——
“ We have left Jabez Clegg at Mr. Mabbott’s, Miss Chad-
wic ,” with an inclination of his head. “He was afraid you
would be anxious for your father’s safety, and I offered to see
Mr. Chadwick home in his stead.”
Ellen’s black eyes expanded questioningly, and Mrs. Chad-
wick’s mild voice, in accents indicative of some fear, asked—
“ I hope not of necessity, sir?”
I “Well, yes, madam; and I must hasten back ; he has
received a sabre-cut on Eh, dear I ” '
Ben Travis, for he it was, darted forward to catch Ellen
Chadwick, just as he had previously caught Jabez at Mabbott’s
gate :—Aspinall’s sabre had wounded two instead of one—Ellen
Chadwick, who that day had seen what sabre-cuts meant, had

fainted. Ben Travis bore her to the sofa, Mr. Chadwick
pulled the bell-rope, Augusta ran for water, Mrs. Chadwick
called for vinegar and burnt feathers, and in the midst of the
commotion Mr. Ashton burst into the room in a state of excite-
ment very foreign to his nature, which was tolerably easy-
gomg.
“Thank God, Augusta, you are here l” he exclaimed.
“Your mother is almost distracted about you—Why, what is
the matter with Ellen? The whole world seems gone mad to
day—or hell has set its demons loose. I’ve just seen our
friend Captain Hindley’s horse take fright in Mosley Street at
the ﬁring, and dash with him against those half-built houses at
the corner of Tib Street. He was pitched off amongst the
bricks and scaffolding, and the horse dropped. Old Simon
Clegg happened to be there, and he helped me and another
to raise Hindley, who had fared better than his horse, for it
was stone~dead, and he is only badly hurt.”
' He had gone on talking, though hardly anyone had listened
to him. Ellen’s fainting ﬁt engrossed feminine attention, and
the yeoman, seeing her revive, was saying to Mr. Chadwick,
“You will excuse me now, sir. I must look after our poor
friend Jabez.”
“ Eh what l Jabez? You don’t mean to say anything has
happened to Jabez Clegg?” exclaimed Mr. Ashton, pausing
in the act of drawing forth his snuff-box.
Travis was gone, but Mr. Chadwick, whose tongue now was
none of the readiest, stammered out——
“Yes, William, w~we left him at Mab-bott the confectioner’s.
In try-ying to-o save me he got b-badly w-wounded. I’m
v-very s-sorry, for he is a n-noble y-young man.”
“The wretches! I’d almost as soon they’d wounded me!
Stay here, Augusta ;” and with that Mr. Ashton was off after
Ben Travis. The main streets were unsafe, so he also took
the back way, and across Back-Piccadilly to Mr. Mabbott’s,
with a celerity scarcely to have been expected, for he was not
a young man. But his apprentice had won upon him not only
by his integrity and business qualiﬁcations, but by his manifest
interest in the family he served, especially the daughter. Let
me not be misunderstood. Augusta was the cynosure of Mr.
Ashton’s eyes ; the homage of the apprentice to the school-
girl, he estimated as the homage of an apprentice merely, and
was gratiﬁed thereby, but his imagination never travelled
beyond.

He found Jabez on a chintz-covered couch in Mr. Mabbott’s
sitting-room, his arm bound tightly with a towel, through which
the blood would force its way. He was pale and exhausted
from excessive haemorrhage, but seemed more concerned about
the fate of the multitude outside than for his own.
Ben Travis, discovering that no one had dared to venture in
quest of a doctor, .threw himself across his horse, which he
found where he had left it, and was off up Mosley Street and
thence back to Piccadilly, intent on bringing either Dr. Hull or
Dr. Hardie. His uniform was a protection, and so the doctors
told him; Dr. Hardie plainly saying that black cloth. was not
plate-armour, and that his friend, whosoever he might he, must
wait until the tumult had somewhat subsided.
But Jabez was only a few hours without attention. There
were hundreds wounded that day, who had to skulk into holes
and corners to hide themselves and their agony as best they
might, afraid of seeking surgical aid, lest Nadin and his
myrmidons should pounce upon them, and haul them to prison
as rebels. ~

CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH.*
ACTION AND RE—ACTION.
HE August sun had looked down in its noontide
splendour when the events I have attempted to de-
scribe took place ,' but the tide of terror and destruction swept
beyond the limits I have covered, and after the ﬁrst ﬁerce on-
slaught, as if the carnage had been insufﬁcient, artillery went
rattling and thundering through the streets, to awe the peaceful
and terriﬁed inhabitants. As the ﬂying crowd, dispersing, left
bare St. Peter’s Field, pressing outward and onwards through
all accessible ramiﬁcations, the main thoroughfares thinned,
. ﬁnd the scene of action took a wider radius.
Still the gallant hussars and yeomanry went prancing
through these thoroughfares, dashing hither and thither, slash-
ing at stragglers, shouting to the rebels, and to each other, to
“clear the way ” ; driving curious and anxious spectators
from doors and windows, and ﬁring at refractory outstretched
heads.
To clear the streets more effectually, cannon were planted at
the entrances of the leading outlets from the town, and, as if
that were not enough, the artillery had orders to ﬁre.
At New Cross two of these guns (which went rattling up Old~
ham Street, to the dismay of Augusta and the Chadwicks, as
well as their neighbours) were posted, one with its hard iron
mouth directed up Newton Lane, the other set to sweep An-
coats Lane, not then so wide as at present.
Nathaniel Bradshaw’s butcher’s shop was situated at the
narrowest part of Ancoats Lane, a little beyond the canal
bridge. The shutters had been closed precipitately on the
ﬁrst alarm, but Martha Bradshaw and her young brother
Matthew opened the window of the room above, and had their
heads stretched out to watch and question the white-faced
people scurrying past in disorder, when Matt Cooper, who

lived with his genial son-in-law, came hurriedly home for
dinner. His route from the tannery lay in a straight line up
Miller’s Lane, past Shude Hill Pits, and the New Cross, into
Ancoats Lane, which he crossed the Market to reach only just
before the cannon lumbered up.
His clogs had rattled as swiftly over the pavement as his
stiﬂ‘ening, hide-bound, long legs would carry them, and observ-
ing the heads of Martha and Matthew advanced from the
window he waved his hand in gesticulation for them to with-
. draw from a post so fraught with peril. But youth is wilful,
and woman curious. They either did not understand, or did
not heed his warning. They did not know all he had seen at
New Cross, or how narrow an escape he had had from
Aspinall’s ﬂashing sabre.
“Do goo in, childer!” he cried, as he drew near, “if yo’
wantn to kep the yeads on yo’r shoulders. Wenches an’ lads
shouldna look on sich soights.”
“ Han yo’ seen Nat? ” the wife asked, anxiously.
“Nawe.”
“ He’s gone t’ see what 0’ th’ mob an’ feightin’s abeawt. Aw
wish he wur whoam.”
Matt wished the same, but went in at the unfastened door,
and passed on to the room beyond, where he found the un-
tended lobscouse boiling over into the ﬁre. He took the lid
off the pot ; then went to the stair~foot, and called “ Martha!”
There being no answer, he strode back through the shop,
saying as he went—~—
“ Dang it, hoo’ll not be content till hoo’s hurt ! ”
He stepped out on the rough pavement, and, looking up,
called out—
“ Do put yo’r yeads in ; yo’ll
A musket-shot, splintering a corner of the stone window-sill
on which they leaned, was more effective than his adjuration.
The cannon boomed simultaneously—a shriek recalled the
hastily-withdrawn heads; and there, on the rough sun-baked
ground before their eyes, lay weltering in blood, a doubled-up
form, which a minute before had been their father, Matt
Cooper, the tanner, the preserver of Jabez, the friend of Simon
and Bess.
This harrowing event was the last of the painful incidents
of that fatal day coming within the scope of this history, which
isolated as they are, the writer knows to be true, even though
they may not be chronicled elsewhere.

The streets grew silent and deserted, save by the military
and medical men, as the day and the night advanced: but with-
in the houses of poor and rich there were loud complaints and
groans, and murmurings, which did not sink to silence with the
day that called them forth.
The town was, as it were, in a state of siege; and men of
business, whether Tories or Radicals, alike felt the stoppage of
trade and commerce in their pockets, whether they felt the
cruelty and injustice to the injured in their hearts or not.
But chieﬂy those who had friends wounded by design or
accident in the melee were loud in their denunciation of the
whole proceedings; and of these neither Mr. Chadwick nor
Mr. Ashton was the least prominent, even though the one was
paralysed, and they were of contrary shades of politics, the
former being what he himself called “ a staunch and true out-
and-out Tory,” the latter having a leaning towards Liberal—
not to say Radical—opinions, and at county elections voting
with the Whigs.
The stiff “ Church and King” man, whose sons had
distinguished themselves in the Army and Navy, and whose
son-in-law, Walmsley, might also be said to have distinguished
himself in the loyal Manchester Yeomanry—he who had been a
member of John Shaw’s Club in the Market Place, and called
for his P or his Q bowl of punch even before the aroma of
Jacobinism ceased to ﬂavour the delectable compound, and
while yet John Shaw himself lived to draw his silver spoon
from its particular pocket to concoct the same, and (inexorable
autocrat that he was) could crack his whip in his poky bar-
parlour in the ears of even noble customers who lingered after
his imperative “ Eight o’clock gentlemen; eight o’clock !” or
summon his sturdy factotum, Molly, with mop and pail, to
drive thence with wetted feet those whom the whip had failed
to inﬂuence—he who had stuck to the club even after John
Shaw, Molly, and the punch-house itself had gone to the dust
—he, Charles Chadwick, whose Toryism had grown with his
growth, was foremost in condemning the proceedings of Peter-
100.
In his own person he had witnessed how the actual breakers
of the peace were those commissioned to preserve it. In the
wanton attack on himself, an unarmed, defenceless, disabled
old man, be recognised the general characteristics of the whole
affair, and entered his protest against so lawless an exposition
of the law. He was himself a peaceable man, a loyal subject,

going quietly about his own business when Jabez intercepted
to his own hurt, the sabre destined for his grey head.
Matthew Cooper, his tenant’s son-in-law, was as peaceable and
well-disposed; and if so, might not the bulk of the so-called
rebels have been the same ? In his gratitude to Jabez he de-
nounced the mounted yeoman who had sabred him as “a
drunken, blood-thirsty miscreant,” though in the hurry, excite-
ment, and agitation attending his own withdrawal from the press
by Mr. Mabbott, he had failed to identify his pursuer with John
Walmsley’s dashing friend, and the exclamation of Ben Travis I;
had not reached his ear in the confusion. '_
Easy-going Mr. Ashton also seemed transformed by the _
event. He had certainly lost the valuable services of his
apprentice for some time to come; but that was the very
least ingredient in the cup of his wrath. By faithful intelli-
gent service; by persevering industry, by a thousand little
actions which had shown his interest in his employers, and
his devotion to his old friends, Jabez had won a place in his
master’s esteem and affection no other apprentice of any grade
had ever attained.
And now that Jabez had risked the dangers of the soldier-
ridden street to bear his beloved daughter to a place of
safety, and had braved the storm of foot and horse, and ﬁre
and steel, to rescue his brother-in-law by endangering his own
life or limbs, his admiration and gratitude rose to their highest,
and in proportion his denunciation of an outrage which called
for such a sacriﬁce was strong and vehement—all the more
that he sympathised with the objects of the meeting.
When he and Simon Clegg (who had been drawn to the
scene in his dinner-hour with others, like moths to a candle)
picked up his cavalry friend, Robert Hindley, from amongst
the building materials, and disengaged him from his dead
horse, he could not refrain from telling the disabled warrior,
with all a friend’s frankness, that “it served him right i”
Open expression of private opinion on the conduct of rulers
was dangerous at that period, as may be supposed; but private
opinion became public opinion, too strong and too universal
to be put in fetters.
Mr. Tyas, the Times reporter, had been taken prisoner on
the hustings, and it was imagined that only a one-sided
account—forwarded by the magistracy in justiﬁcation of their
conduct—would reach London. But other intelligent reporters
were at large, the garbled statements sent to the Government
Rig:

press were confuted by the truth-telling narratives of Messrs.
Archibald Prentice and John Edward Taylor, which appeared
the following day, and roused the indignation of the realm.
These statements being more than substantiated by the Times
reporter on his liberation, national indignation rose to a
ferment.
This alarmed the Manchester magistrates; a meeting was
hurriedly arranged to take place on Thursday, the 19th (the
third day from Peterloo), at the Police Station; thence
adjourned to the “Star Inn,” in Deansgate; and, as though
the meeting had been a public one, resolutions were passed
thanking magistrates and soldiers for their services on the
previous Monday.
Then Manchester rose, as it were, en masse, to vindicate its
own honour, and reject participation in a disgraceful deed;
“A declaration,” says one historian, was issued, protesting
against the ‘ Star Inn’ resolutions, which in the course of two
or three days received close upon ﬁve thousand signatures,”
in obtaining which none were more active than Mr. Ashton
and (despite his paralysis) Mr. Chadwick. Old Mrs. Clowes '
talked her customers into signing, and Parson Brookes 'was
not idle. Mr. William Clough, whose old servant Matthew
Cooper had been shot down at his own door, gave the tanners
a holiday, that they might inﬂuence their fellows ; and Simon
Clegg, T om Hulme, and Nathaniel Bradshaw seemed
ubiquitous, they went to work with such determined zeal.
Hey did not feel “ thankful ” to the magistrates for the blood
shed on Peterloo Monday.
Neither did the bulk of the inhabitants; and an energetic
protest against the proceedings and representations of the
magistracy was the result.
To counteract this, the Prince Re'gent, through his mouth-
piece Lord Sidmouth, sent his thanks to the magistrates and
the military leaders for “their prompt, decisive, and efﬁcient
measures.” But this, instead of calming, lashed the public
mind to frenzy. Meetings to remonstrate with the Regent and
to petition'for inquiry were held in all the large towns, Sir
Francis Burdett presiding at one held in Westminster.
Subscriptions were also got up for the relief of such wounded
and disabled persons a_,- had crept into holes and corners to

Inﬁrmary ; and Parson Brookes, to the disgust of some of his
clerical brethren, lent his aid in ferreting out the miserables, if
he did not ostentatiously ﬂourish his subscription in‘ their
service ; and I rather think a certain “J.S.” in the subscription-
list represented the mite of the Grammar School head-master,
but I could not take an aﬂidavit on the subject. But when
the wounded, as far as ascertained, amounted to six-hundred
irrespective of the killed, subscriptions had need to be many
and ample.
Another token of the change in public sentiment was shown
in the satires and pasquinades which appeared on the walls, or
were distributed from hand to hand. Previously to Peterloo
a set of anonymous verses in ridicule of the popular leader had
been distributed. They began and were headed as follows :—
ORATOR HUNT.
I.
Blithe Harry Hunt was an orator bold—
Talked away bravely and blunt;
And Rome in her glory, and Athens of old,
With all their loud talkers, of whom we are told,
Couldn’t match Orator Hunt !
II.
Blithe Harry Hunt was a sightly man—
Somethirig ’twixt giant and runt :
His paunch was a large one, his visage was wan,
And to hear his long speeches vast multitudes ran.
0 rare Orator Hunt !
' VI.
Orator Hunt was the man for a riot—
Bully in language and front—
And thought when a nation had troubles to sigh at,
’Twas quite unbecoming to sit cool and quiet.
O rare Orator Hunt !
VIII.
How Orator Hunt’s many speeches will close—
Tedious, bombastic, and blunt—
In a halter or diadem, God only knows : '
The sequel might well an arch-conjurer pose. "
, O rare Orator Hunt ! :.=

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.
WOUNDED.
T the extreme end of Mr. Mabbott’s long double-
countered shop was an expansive archway, closed in
general by folding doors, through which entrance was
afforded to a narrow sitting-room, the length of which was
just by so much less than the width of the shop as was re-
quired for a passage and staircase. Once a year the open
archway revealed a shimmering mass of snowy sugar-work,
the towers and turrets of a castle on a rock, or the illumi-
nated windows of a magniﬁcent palace, ﬁt for any princess
of fairyland, with pleasure-gardens and lake, or fountain and
pond, wherein stately swans ﬂoated, and were overlooked
by darnes and cavaliers created by the confectioner and his
satellites.
For the ﬁfty other weeks it was simply a snug parlour,
comfortably furnished according to the fashion of the time.
And it was in this room we left Jabez, whilst good-
natured Ben Travis, leaving his more patriotic comrades to
“hack and hew” at their pleasure, galloped hither and
thither in search of a surgeon to dress the wounded arm.
Every doctor in the Inﬁrmary had his hands full; Dr.
Hull, from his windows in Mosley Street, and Dr. Hardie
from his in Piccadilly, had been satisﬁed that if they ven-
tured forth they might soon need doctoring themselves—
and they both pleaded “medical etiquette” in excuse for
their lukewarmness. They were “physicians, not surgeons.”
He bethought himself of Mr. Huertley, in Oldham Street,
but even he had more than one wounded patient in his
surgery, and was 10th to encounter the danger outside.
Ben Travis, however, would take no denial. He waited
‘until sundry gaping wounds were closed, cuts plaistered and
bandaged, a broken limb set, and a bullet extracted, even

lending a hand himself where unskilled help could be avail-
able, being less bemused with liquor than many of his
cavalry corps. Then, although they were almost within a
stone’s throw of their destination—as Oldham Street was not
safe for a civilian to cross on foot, with loaded cannon in
such close proximity—Travis mounted the surgeon behind
him, the latter not sorry to have the yeoman’s capacious
body in its conspicuous uniform for a shield, as they clashed
across into Back-Piccadilly t0 Mabbott’s back door.
As they passed Chadwick’s the younger man cast a sharp
glance of scrutiny at the drawing-room windows, and bowed
low in recognition of the face for which he was looking—
the face he had seen so pale and pitiful, bending over an
afﬂicted father, and so shocked to hear of even an appren-
tice wounded in that father’sbehalf.
Ben Travis had a big body and a big heart, but he had
little knowledge of the hearts of womankind, or he might have
found another solution for Ellen Chadwick’s fainting ﬁt. He
did not know how she had trembled for another on seeing
him dismount at Mr. Huertley’s door, nor how she had
watched, too sick and sad to descend to the dining-room, when
the spoiled dinner was at length set on the table—watched
eagerly and anxiously, her heart’s pulsations counting each
second a minute, as hours elapsed before she saw them
mount and away, and noted the direction they took. And she
saw no admiration in the low bow of the ﬁne soldierly young
gentleman—only the polite salutation of a stranger introduced
casually by the untoward events of the day, albeit, having
rendered her father a service, and professed himself the friend
of Jabez, she was bound to recognise him as he passed.
To Jabez himself, lying faint and exhausted with loss of
blood, on kind Mr. Mabbott’s chintz-covered squab-sofa, every-
thing was a haze, and the people around him little more than
voices. He was perfectly conscious when Mr. Mabbott hastily
cutaway the sleeve of his jacket, and bound the wounded arm
as tightly as towels could bind. When Mr. Ashton put his
troubled face into the confectioner’s small parlour, Mr.
Mabbott was in the act of reaching from a corner cupboard a
small square spirit decanter, and an engraved wine-glass, in
order to administer a dose of brandy to the young man, then
rapidly sinking into unconsciousness.
Under its inﬂuence he revived for awhile; but, as the blood
gradually soaked through the towelling, he grew fainter, in spite

of brandy, and by the time Ben Travis (who had surely kept
the promise made in school-boy days) brought Dr. Huertley to
his aid he had lapsed into a stupor from which the manipula-
tions of the surgeon barely aroused him.
“You should have tied a ligature tightly as possible round
the arm above the wound, ﬁrst thing,” said the surgeon, ad-
dressing those around him—“a bit of tape, a strip of linen, a
garter—anything narrow, to stop the haemorrhage. Had this
been done, there would have been less effusion of blood, and
our patient would not have been so utterly prostrated.”
“Just so, just so,” assented Mr. Ashton, adding, “ but Mr.
Mabbott had ”
“ Done his best—-no doubt,” interrupted the surgeon, “ or
our young friend might have bled to death. But the tight,
narrow ligature would have been better ; and many a valuable
life may have been saved or lost this day through that bit of
knowledge or~the want of it.” ’
Mr. Ashton’s “Just so, just so; I daresay you are right,”
was followed up by “Shall we be able to remove him to-night,
, Mr. Huertley? He is my apprentice, and has been injured
whilst bravely protecting your opposite neighbour, Mr. Chad-
wick, my brother-in-law. I should like to get him home, to be
under Mrs. Ashton’s care, as well as to relieve Mr. Mabbott, to
whom, I am sure, we all feel greatly indebted.”
“ Don’t name it, I beg; at fearful times like this,” said Mr.
Mabbott, with a shudder, “ it does not do to think of trouble
or of ceremony. But I do not imagine the doctor would
counsel the young man’s removal to-night, even if the road
were clear and safe. ” _ '
“ Certainly not,” replied Mr. Huertley, as he packed up his
lint and instruments. “And in my opinion, if you remove
him to-morrow you must do it carefully on every account, and
will have to smuggle him away in a hackney-coach, lest he
should be pounced upon as a wounded rebel.” ’
“ Two days, however, elapsed before Mr. Mabbott’s sofa
lost its occupant, and even then the strong arm of Tom
Hulme and the loving care of Bess were needed to help Jabez,
feeble and wan, to the hackney-carriage brought up to the back
door, which bore him slowly away, avoiding the main streets,
until they passed under the arched gateway in Back Mosley
Street whence he had last emerged at a headlong pace to pre-
vent Miss Augusta getting into danger.
Some remembrance of this ﬂashed through the brain of

Jabez as the coach stopped in the court-yard, and on the house
door-steps he beheld Mrs. Ashton, Augusta, and Ellen Chad-
wick, all three waiting to receive him as if he had been a
wounded relative returning from far-off victories to his own
hearth. Nay, the very servants hovered in the back-ground,-
even cross Kezia pressing to have a ﬁrst look at him.
Mrs. Ashton herself, with the graceful dignity which sat so
well upon her, went down the steps to lead him up and into the
house, and as she touched his left hand and unwounded arm,
she said impressively,
“Jabez Clegg, I understand we owe our brother’s life to
your self-abnegation, if not that of our daughter also. I regret
that your noble intervention should have cost you so clear; but
I thank you most truly, and shall not forget it.”
The stately lady’s eyes were humid as she led Jabez into
their common parlour (the room in which Augusta had dis-
played his specimens of incipient artistry) and there placed him
on the large soft sofa,‘already prepared with pillows for his
reception. The attention touched him to the heart ; the
humble apprentice, feeling himself honoured, raised the lady’s
hand to his lips as gracefully and reverently as ever did knight
of old romance.
And then he would have closed his eyes for very weariness
but a little soft warm hand stole into his feeble one, and thrill-
ing through him, a faint tinge chased the deathly pallor from
his face as Augusta’s voice, full of commiseration, said apolo-
getically, “ I had no idea, Jabez, that I was sending you into
danger when I asked you to look for Uncle Chadwick; I am
so sorry you have been hurt.”
He held the little hand of his master’s daughter for one or
two delicious minutes, while he answered feebly—“ Never
mind, Miss Ashton ; I was only too glad to be there in time ; ”
and lapsed into so ethereal a dream as he released it, that the
low, broken grateful thanks of Ellen Chadwick left but the im-
pression on his mind that she was very much in earnest and had
called him Mr. Clegg.
Mr. Clegg ! When had the College-boy—the Blue-coat ap-
prentice—been anything but jabez Clegg? Mr. Clegg ! It
was from such lips social recognition, and so blent strangely
with his dream. Ah ! could he but have known how much of
latent tenderness was embodied in those incoherent expressions
of a daughter’s gratitude, or that the speaker dared not trust
her faltering tongue with his Christian name !

150 The Manchester Man.
Mrs. Ashton called the young ladies away.
“ My dears, you had better resume your occupations, and
leave Jabez to repose ; it is not well to crowd about an invalid
on so sultry a day as this.”
So Miss Chadwick went, with her tatting-shuttle, back to her
seat by the one window where the friendly shade of the dove-
coloured curtains screened from observation any glances which
might chance to stray from the tatting to the sofa; and Miss
Ashton went back to her music-stool, where the sunbeams,
falling through the other window, lit up her lovely proﬁle, shot
a glint of gold through her hair, and showed the dimples in
her white shoulder to the halfsshut, dreaming eyes of Jabez,
who listened, entranced, as she practised scales and battle-
pieces, waltzes and quadrilles, totally unconscious that she was
feeding a fever in the soul of the apprentice more to be feared
than the stroke of Aspinall’s sabre, though it had cut into the
bone. ' -
Not that she was a simple school-girl, and ignorant of the
power of beauty. She was pretty well as romantic as any
girl of that romantic age who, being ﬁfteen, looked a year
older, and learned the art of fascination from the four-volume
novels of the period. Mrs. Ashton herself subscribed to the
fashionable circulating library of the town, but she was some'
what choice in her reading, and had Miss Augusta stopped
where her mother did she would have done well. But it so
happened that, after feasting on the wholesome peas her
mother provided, she fell with avidity on husks obtained
surreptitiously elsewhere. Kisses from Augusta could always
coax coins from papa, and as a Miss Bohanna kept open a well-
known, well-stocked circulating library in Shudehill, albeit in a
cellar, its contiguity to Bradshaw Street and Mrs. Broadbent’s
enabled Miss Ashton (or Cicely for her) to smuggle in amongst
her school-books other ﬁctions, such as Elizabeth Helme and
Anna Maria Roche used to concoct, and Samuel Richardson
provided, to delight our grandmothers with.
So Miss Ashton was quite prepared to be admired and play
the heroine prematurely ; but she had been reared in the same
house with Jabez, had been caressed and waited upon by him
as a child, and anything so absurd as her father’s apprentice
falling in love with her had never dawned upon her apprehen-
sion. Then not even his wounded arm could make him hand-
some enough for a hero, so she plunged through the “ Battle
of Prague,” and “Lodoiska,” and glided into the “Copen_

hagen Waltz,” with no suspicion of a listener more than
ordinary.
Mrs. vAshton‘, who was back-stitching a shirt-wristband
(family linen was then made at home), imagined that Jabez
was dozing, and, unwilling to disturb him, only spoke when a
false note, or a passage out of time, called for a low-voiced
hint to her daughter, or when she found occasion to make
some slight observation to the equally silent Ellen.
Presently the clock in the hall proclaimed “ﬁve.” Miss
Ashton closed music-books and piano; Miss Chadwick com-
pleted a loop, then put her tatting away in a small, oblong, red
morocco reticule 5 Mrs. Ashton laid the wristband in her work-
basket, which she put out of sight in a panelled cupboard with-
in the wall, sheathed the scissors hanging from her girdle,
folded up the leather housewife containing her cut skeins of
thread, 810. ; James brought in the tea-board, with its genuine
China tea—service, plates with cake and bread-and-butter, and
whilst he went back to Kezia for the tea-urn, in walked Mr.
Ashton, and with him the Rev. Joshua Brookes.
One might have supposed his ﬁrst salutation would have
been to the lady of the house. Nothing of the kind! With
a passing nod to Mrs. Ashton, who had extended her hand,
he marched straight to the sofa, and greeted its occupant
with-
“Well, young Cheat-the~ﬁshes, so you’ve been in the wars
again.”
“Yes, sir,” said Jabez, attempting to rise.
“ Lie still, lad ! And so you thought a velveteen jacket de-
fensive armour against sharpened steel?”
“ I never thought about it, sir.”
“ Ugh I Then I suppose you reckoned a young man’s arm
worth less than an old man’s head ! Eh ”
Jabez smiled.
“Certainly, sir.”
“Humph! I thought as much!” Then darting a keen
inquisitive glance from under his shaggy eyebrows at the
prostrate young fellow, he added in his very raspiest tones,
“And I daresay you’ve no notion whose sabre carved the wing
of the goose so cleverly?”
What little blood was left in his body seemed to mount to
the face of Jabez, the old scar on his brow—which every year
made less conspicuous—purpled and grew livid. Old Joshua
needed no more.


## p. 152 (#164) ############################################

152 The Manchester Man.
“ Ah, I see you do ! Well, are you inclined to forgive the
fellow this time P ”
All ears were on the alert. Jabez caught the quick turn of
his kind master’s head. He hesitated, paled, and ﬂushed
again. Joshua Brookes waited. There was some indecision
in the reply when it did come.
“ I am not sure, sir. But he was very drunk. I don’t think
he would have done it if he had been sober.”
“ Just so, Jabez—just so ! ” assented Mr. Ashton with
evident satisfaction and a tap on his snuff-box-lid.
Ben Travis had revealed the name of Mr. Chadwick’s
assailant to the manufacturer, and he to the chaplain.
“ Oh ! that’s your opinion, is it?” cried the latter, crustily,
wheeling sharply round to disguise a smile.—-—“ Here, madam,
let’s have a cup of sober tea after that l ”
“ I think, Mr. Brookes,” said Mrs. Ashton, as she seated
herself, “ with all due deference to you—I think you ask too
much from Jabez. I do not consider drunkenness any excuse
for brutality.” -
“ No excuse for the brute, madam, certainly; but a reason
why a reasoning man should forgive the brute incapable of
reason.”
“Just so, Parson !” chimed in Mr. Ashton laying his
Barcelona handkerchief across his knee.
“ I don’t see it, sir,” argued Mrs. Ashton, handing a willow-
patterned cup and saucer, with his tea, to her interlocutor 3 “ a
man who is abrute when intoxicated should keep sober. For
my own part, I should be loth to let the same stick beat me
twice. Our apprentice has borne quite too much from that
fellow ” (she waxed indignant), “and there is a limit to for-
giveness.”
“Yes, madam,” answered the Parson snappishly, “there is
a limit to forgiveness; but the limit is ‘not seven times, but
seventy times seven l ’ ”
There was no more to be said. The rough chaplain spoke
with authority, and from experience, and Jabez knew it.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.
MR. CLEGG!
OWEVER grateful Mrs. Ashton might be she never lost
sight of her personal dignity, and had no idea of ad
mitting Jabez on terms of equality after that ﬁrst reception.
In his helpless condition he required attention, which she
could not condescend to render personally ; yet she was as.
little inclined to delegate the .duty to Kezia, who was never
over well-disposed towards him, and who might have resented
the call to “wait on a ’prentice lad,” or to Cicily, who was too
young to have the run of a young man’s chamber. It was like
herself to hit on the happy mean, and invite Bess Hulme at
once to satisfy her own longings, and meet the requirements of
the case, by waiting on her foster-child in his helplessness,
bringing with her her own boy, now two years old, to be com-
mitted to willing Cicily’s care when the mother was herself en-
gaged.
Yet the apprentice never again sank into the old ruts. His
bed in the attic was turned over to his successor. From that
parlour where he had lain and listened to Augusta’s music, and
Parson Brookes’s dictum,- where Mrs. Ashton had placed his
pillows, and Ellen Chadwick had supplied his wants with such
intuitive perception at tea-time; from that room he went to a
chamber on an upper ﬂoor, furnished neatly but plainly, with
due regard to comfort.
There was a mahogany camp-bedstead, draped with chintz of
most extraordinary device. The bed was of feathers—not
ﬂock. An oak chest of drawers, which did duty for a dressing-
table, stood by the window, which itself overlooked the yard,
and on the top stood a small oval swing looking-glass. There
were small strips of carpet along the two sides of the bed, which
did not touch the wall ; an almost triangular washstand in one
corner, and near the middle of the room a rush-bottom chair

and a tripod table. There was also a cushioned easy-chair,
which had a suggestiveness of being there for that special
occasion only; and Jabez, who, on his ﬁrst glance around
began to speculate whether the whole would not vanish with
his convalescence, was reassured when he saw that his wooden
box had been brought from the attic and stood against the
wall.
The six-foot, bronzed, bearded man of forty remains a child
to the mother who bore him, or the woman who nursed him.
And as she had laid him in his cradle when a baby, Bess helped
Jabez to his new bed, fed him with the beef-tea which Kezia
had prepared (for a wonder, without a grumble), gave him the
cooling draught Mr. Huertley had sent in, smoothed his pillows
for repose, and kissed his brow, with a “God bless thee!”
much as she had done when he was an ailing child, but with all
the access of motherliness her own maternity had given.
Nevertheless he did not sleep readily. Neither Bessy’s
soothing hand nor the soft bed superinduced slumber. He
was modest, and “ Mr. Clegg” haunted him. He could not
see the connection between his impulsive rush forward to check
the yoeman’s plunging steed, and his employer’s recognition of
the service rendered.
“ I only did my duty,” he debated with himself, as he lay
there, with a mere streak of light from the glimmering rush-
light showing between the closely drawn-curtains—~“ I only did
my duty. Anyone else would have done the same in my place.
If I had once thought of consequences and grasped the reins
deliberately, there would have been some bravery in ﬁnd. But
I never thought of the sword, not I. I only thought of poor
old Mr. Chadwick and Molly; and I’m sure Mr. Mabbott’s
ready hand did as good service as mine. Only I happened to
get hurt. Yes, that’s it! And they are sorry for me. I won-
der if that rufﬁanly fellow did know whom he was striking at P I
hardly think he did, he was so very tipsy. If I fancied he did, I
——but he could not. He was just blind drunk. What a pity, for
such a handsome fellow, not older than I am, and agentleman’s
son too ! Forgive him ! I don’t think I’ve much to forgive. I’d
hear the pain twice over for all the kind things that have been
said and done since ! Tea in the parlour with Parson Brookes
and all! And. this handsome bed-room [handsome only in
untutored eyes]. And all the thanks I have had for so little.
And, oh ! the bliss of holding Augusta’s delicate hand in mine,
and hearing the music those white ﬁngers made. It’s worth


## p. 155 (#167) ############################################

the pain three times over. And Mr. Clegg too l .Mr. Clegg!
' How like a gentleman it does sound ! Will anybody call me
Mr. Clegg besides Miss Chadwick? How fond she must be of
her father, from the way she thanked me !”
(Ah Jabez ! what ovculist can cure blindness such as thine ?)
If less consecutive, still in some such current ran the young
man’s thoughts, until chaos came, and his closed eyes saw in—
numerable Mr. Cleggs written on walls, and ﬂoor, and curtains,
and a delicious symphony seemed to chorus the words, and
“lap him in Elysium.” ' i ,,
After that, once each day, Mrs. Ashton paid him a brief
visit of inspection and inquiry,vgenerally timed so as to meet
the surgeon. Mr. Ashton, with less of ceremony, dropped in
occasionally, to bring hiin a'neWspaper, book, or pamphlet to
beguile the hours, and was not .above loitering for a pleasant
chat on matters indoors and out, the state of political feeling,
and of business, in a manner so friendly Jabez was at a loss to
account for it. Once or twiceAu-gusta tapped at the door, to
ask if Jabez was better, and to “hope he would soon be well,”
and the simple words ran'through his brain with a thousand
chimerical meanings.
Joshua Brookes paid him a couple of visits, brought him
papers of sweetmeats and messages from Mrs. Clowes, and a
Latin Testament and a worn fEneid from his own stores, as a
little light reading. Mrs. Chadwick, too, made her appearance
at his bedside, with kindly and grateful words from her hus-
band; and amongst them he was in a fair way of becoming
elevated into a hero to his own hurt.
Simon Clegg (who pulled off his thick Sunday shoes in the
kitchen, and went up-stairs in his stocking feet, lest he should
make a clatter, and spoil the carpets) counteracted the mis-
chief, and somewhat clipped the pinions of soaring imagina-
‘tion.
Jabez, his arm bandaged and sustained by a sling, lay with
his head against the straight, high back of his padded chair,
between the window and the ﬁreplace, which glowed, not with
live coals, but a beau~pot of sunﬂowers and hollyhocks from
Simon’s garden. At his feet lay little Sam, fast asleep, with
his fat arms round the neck of Nelson, the black retriever,
which had somehow contrived to sneak past Kezia with his tail
between his legs, and to follow Bess up-stairs, where he had es-
tablished himself in perfect content. ~
Simon greeted his foster-son with bated breath, awed no

doubt by the lamp-bearing statues in hall and staircase, and
hardly raised his voice above a whisper while he stayed. He
had much to tell which the reader already knows, but he took
his leave with quite a long oration, impressed no doubt by the
comfort in that chamber, as well as by the grandeur in rooms
of which he had caught a glimpse through open doors. Jabez
himself, being still feeble, had spoken but little.
“ Moi lad,” said be, “this is a grand place, but dunnot yo’
let it mak’ yo preawd ; an’ aw hope as yo’re thankful yo’han
'fallen among sich koind folk.”
“ Indeed I am.”
“ Yo’ did nowt but whatn wur ye’r duty, moi lad, as aw trust
thah allays wilt ,' and thah’s getten a mester and missis i’ ten
theawsand, to mak’ so mich on a cut in a ’prentice’s arm—ay,
tho it wur got i’ savin’ one 0’ theer own kin ! Luk yo’, Jabez :

wi’ the ruck, an’ came off better than some folk. So thenk God
it’s no waur, an’ bear no malice ; an’ thenk God as sent yo’ theer
i’ the nick 0’ time.”
In little more than a fortnight Jabez was downstairs again,
although his arm, not being thoroughly healed, yet needed sup-
port, and he was not hurried into the warehouse. Neither was
he again invited to join the family, Mrs. Ashton having objected
to Mr. Ashton’s propOsition.
“ It would lift the young man out of his sphere, William, and
do him more harm than good. Only very strong heads can
stand sudden elevation ; and it is well to make no more haste
than good speed.”
But Mr. Ashton’s “Just so ” was less deﬁnite than ordinary,
and he took a second pinch of snuff unawares, with a prolonged
emphasis, which supplied the place of words. To the obser-
vant, Mr. Ashton’s snuff-box contained as much eloquence as
did Lord Burleigh’s celebrated wig. He had taken a liking to
the lad from the ﬁrst, paid very little deference to Mrs. Grundy,
and gave Jabez credit for a stronger head than did his more
cautious and philosophic lady.

Yet Jabez, to his surprise, found that his little room down-
stairs had undergone a transformation. It was no longer a
bare ofﬁce, ﬁtted only with a desk and stool. Desk and stool
were there still, but a carpet, hanging shelves, a few useful
books, and other furniture had been introduced, the result
being a compact parlour. Mrs. Ashton had her own way of
showing goodwill.
His previous application to work in that room, when his
fellow-apprentices in over-hours were cracking jokes on the
kitchen settle, lounging about the yard, tormenting or being
tormented by Kezia, had served somewhat to isolate and lift
him above them, albeit he. took his meals in the kitchen with
the rest. This separation was now conﬁrmed by orders Kezia
received to “ serve Clegg’s dinner in his own room 3” orders
which Kezia resented with asperity, and at least three days’
ill-humour, and which James declined to execute. He was
“ not goin’ to disgrace his cloth by waitin’ on ’prentice lads!”
Ready-handed Cicily came to the rescue, and took the ofﬁce on
herself, amid the banter of the kitchen, which the quick-witted
maid returned with right good will and right good temper.
Permission to receive his friends in his own room occasion-
ally had been graciously accorded by Mrs Ashton herself, with
the characteristic observation——
“ They are worthy people, Jabez Clegg, and you owe them a
son’s duty; besides, you need some relaxation—‘ The over-
strained bow is apt to snap,’ and ‘ All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy.”’
Altogether he was more than satisﬁed. He was not demon-
strative, but his heart swelled as he felt within himself that all
these little things were stepping stones upwards 3 and he
mentally resolved to mount them fairly. He recognised that
he was rising, and ere the week was out he found that others
recognised it also.
His blood-stained garments had been removed, whither he
knew not, and he had had to fall back on his grey frieze Sunday
suit. Be sure he began to calculate the chances of getting a
fresh one.
As he was able to go out, he was employed on out-door busi-
ness until his arm should regain its full vitality, and one of his
errands was with a note to Mr. Chadwick’s tailor, in King Street.
At ﬁrst he thought there was some mistake when the fraction
of a man proceeded without more ado to take his measure.
Saturday night proved there had been no mistake. On his '

bed, accompanied by a very kind note from Mr. Chadwick
(written with his left hand), lay not only a well-cut, well-made
suit of clothes, but a hat, white linen shirts, neck-cloths, and
hose.
Did ever young girl turn up her back hair, or young man
assume his ﬁrst coat indifferently? To Jabez—the foundling
V—the Blue-coat apprentice, this was not merely a ﬁrst coat,
not merely a badge of approaching manhood. The whole out-
ﬁt, provided as it was by his master’s brother-in-law, seemed a
recognition of the station he was henceforth to ﬁll. No clerk
in the counting-house was so well equipped as he, when he
stood before his oval swing-glass for the ﬁrst time far too
small), and endeavoured to survey himself therein, that ﬁne
September Sunday morning.
- I will. not presume to say that he looked the conventional
gentleman in that suit of glossy brown broadcloth, and beaver
hat; I will not say that he did not feel stiff in them. Only
use gives ease 3 but this I will say, that a more manly ﬁgure
never gave shape to garments, or a more noble head to a hat,
albeit there was more of strength than beauty in the thee it
shaded.
His forehead was broad and well developed; the reﬂective
as well as the perceptive faculties were there. There was just a
slight defensive rise on the else straight nose; the eyebrows
were full save where a scar broke the line of one. Firm but
pleasant were mouth and dimpled chin, and the lower jaw was
somewhat massive ; but his full grey eyes, dark almost to black-
ness, and standing far apart, were clear and deep as wells
where truth lay hid, though deep emotion had power to kindle
them with the luminosity of stars.
I am afraid he was not the only one on whom Parson Gat-
liffe’s eloquence was thrown away that Sabbath morning. If
he looked up at the Blue-coat boys in the Chetham Gallery
with their quaint blue robes and neat bands, to throw memory
back and imagination forward, others were doing likewise, from
old Simon in his free seat to his envious fellow-’prentices in the
pew, whose mocking grimaces drew upon them the sharp
censure of the beadle.
Party spirit was then at a white heat. Had Peterloo been
written on his forehead it could not have marked him out for
curious eyes more surely than his sling.
Greetings, not altogether congratulatory, followed him
through the churchyard. But old Simon caught his left‘ hand

in a tremulous grasp, his eyes moist with proud emotion. Tom
Hulme beamed upon him, and Mrs. Clowes, energetic as ever,
overtook them a few yards from the chapter-house, just as
Joshua Brookes emerged from the door.
“ Well, my lad, I’m glad to see you at church again !” she
exclaimed, shaking him warmly by the left hand. “I hardly
knew you in your ﬁne clothes- They’ve made quite a gentle-
man of you. We shall have to call you Mr. Clegg now, I
reckon.”
“ Now, Mother Clowes, don’t you give Jabez humhug of that
sort ; it’s sweet, but not wholesome. ‘ Fine feathers make ﬁne
birds.’ He’s as proud as a peacock already. Mr. Clegg, in-
deed !—and him a ’prentice lad not out of his time ! Let him
stick to the name we gave him at his baptism—it’s worth all
your ﬁne Misters.” Andv Joshua turned off, muttering, “ Mr.
Clegg, indeed ! ” as he went away.
Neither the old woman in her antiquated gown and kerchief-
covered mutch, nor the old parson in his cassock and square
cap, modulated their loud voices. Jabez blushed painfully.
Both had touched sensitive chords.
But others had heard the “ Mr. Clegg,” and he heard it
again, from Kezia and the apprentices in every tone of mockery
and derision. Thence it travelled into the warehouse. He
bore it with set teeth through many a painful week, until- the
Litle stuck to him, and the taunt was forgotten in the force of
abit.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD?“
IN THE THEATRE ROYAL.
T has been said that Madame Broadbent had various
subtle ways of advertising her “Academy” (as the direc-
tory has it), by which she generally contrived to “ kill two birds
with one stone.” One of these would scarcely have been prac-
ticable in any but a theatrical town like Manchester, where not
even the ﬁerceness of party politics could close the theatre
doors. She was particularly fond of a good play, and as
particularly careful of her own pocket. So she watched
for such occasions as a special beneﬁt or “ Bespea"’
night, to engage one of the dress-boxes, and take tickets
for a select party of her pupils. The young ladies—apart
from all natural love of amusement and display—were taught
to regard their admission to Mrs. Broadbent’s train as a high
honour—a mark of exceeding distinction; and few were the
parents so stern or so niggardly as to refuse the four shillings
for a box-ticket when Madame invited and Miss pleaded.
The then Theatre Royal, in Fountain Street, which was
opened in 1807, under Macready’s management, and brought
to the ground by ﬁre in 1844, was, in 1820, a building so
capacious—so solidly built—it might not fear comparison with
Drury Lane. Stage, scene-rooms, dressing-rooms, were all on
an extensive scale. There were three tiers of boxes, alarge pit,
and an immense gallery breaking the line of the third tier.
With the exception of the large side boxes, which were
partially on the stage, all these boxes were open to the view,
having only a divisional barrier the height of the parapet, light
iron pillars supporting the weight above. There were no
chairs—only narrow, baize-covered benches, innocent of backs.
And the theatre was lighted by sperm-oil lamps, those round
the auditorium being suspended by cords over pulleys, so as to

be lowered for lighting, trimming, &c. But the glory of that
theatre, of which it was shorn at a later date, was its box-lobby,
a lofty, open promenade, wide as a street, and long in propor-
tion, for its one grand entrance was in Fountain Street, the
other in Back Mosley Street. Only for the step or two at either
end, carriages might have driven through, or depositing their
living loads within at the saloon doors, have turned easily and
driven back.
This lobby was naturally a lounge, as well as a waiting-place
for servants and others with wraps and pattens, neither carriage
nor hackney-coaches being numerous, and the streets being—
well, not quite so clean or well-paved as at present.
The ten days’ trial of Henry Hunt and his compatriots at
York had, as is well known, resulted in sentence of imprison-
ment for different terms, to the discomﬁture of one party, the
exultation of the other. Close upon the promulgation of this
sentence came Easter week, at the beginning of April, 1820,
when Jabez had little more than a month to serve of his
apprenticeship. Edmund Kean was then playing at the
Theatre Royal, supported by Sophia M‘Gibbon—daughter of
Woodfall, the memorable printer of “ Junius”-—a favourite on
the Manchester “boards.”
Either to mark their satisfaction at the result of the trial, or
their admiration of the great tragedian, the ofﬁcers of the
Manchester Yeomanry Cavalry bespoke “ Othello ” for the
Wednesday evening, and Mrs. Broadbent made the most of the
glorious opportunity. She engaged a box close to the centre of
the dress-circle, on terms well understood, and as small people
take less room than large ones, and her front row was very
juvenile, she contrived to make it a proﬁtable investment
even though she took a teacher with her (at a lower rate). The
young ladies assembled at the school, and made quite a proces-
sion to the theatre, where Mrs. Broadbent’s own maid took
charge of hats and cloaks, and waited drearily in the saloon.
Then, duly niarshalled by Madame Broadbent and Miss
Nuttall, they ﬁled into the box decorously, and took their seats,
, the youngest in the van—the whole programme having been
rehearsed and re-rehearsed for a day or two beforehand.
A bouquet of white rosebuds they might have been called,
white muslin was so general ; but one young lady blushed in
pink gauze, and Augusta Ashton’s lovely head and shoulders
were set off by delicate blue crape. There were round neck-
laces of coral or pearl, long loose gloves of cambric or kid, and

every damsel in her teens had her fan. But of fans, commend
me to Madame Broadbent’s. It was no light trifle of ivory or
sandal-wood, but of strong green paper, spotted with gold, with
ribs and frame of ebony, and it measured half-a-yard when
closed. Her well-saved, long-waisted, stiff brocaded robe and
petticoat might have been her wedding-dress kept for state
occasions ; but that fan, slung by a ribbon from her wrist, was
part of her individuality—the symbol of her authority insepa-
rable from her w'alking self. A relic of her younger days, she
employed it—citing Queen Charlotte as her exemplar—to
arrest attention, to admonish, to chastise 5 and woe to the luck-
less little lady on whom it came in admonition!
The box was ﬁlled to the very door, where Miss Nuttall kept
guard. Madame Broadbent displayed her own important
person on the third row above the curly heads of the smaller
fry, and to Augusta Ashton—being a proﬁtable pupil, of whom
she had reason to be proud—was allotted a seat next to herself.
The house was full and fashionable, both stage-boxes being
Occupied by members of the Manchester Yeomanry, resplendent
in silver and blue. Laurence Aspinall, John Walmsley, and
Ben Travis were of the party. In the pit were the critics,
pressing as closely as possible to the stage. Nods and smiles
from friends in different quarters of the theatre greeted the com~
ponent parts of Madame Broadbent’s bevy of innocents, and
smiles responded. '
Then rose the green curtain upon Edmund Kean’s Othello,
and Mrs. M‘Gibbon’s Desdemona. The audience was
enthralled. Act by act the players kept attention ﬁxed, and all
went well until the last scene. But, as Othello pressed the
murderous pillow down, one of Madame Broadbent’s white-
frocked misses in the front row, with whose relatives Desde-
mona lodged when she was not Desdemona, started up, and
cried out piteously—
“ He’s killing Mrs. M‘Gibbon ! He’s killing Mrs.
M‘Gibbon ! ”
The clear voice rang through the house, to the consternation
of the actors, the amusement of some, and the annoyance of
the audience. Some of the oﬂ‘icers laughed outright in the
very face of the tragic Moor; but Madame Broadbent was
furious, all the more that she was bound to suppress her
passion then and there.
For the credit of her “Academy,” she, however, felt bound
to resent so ﬂagrant a breach of decorum. Tapping the tear-

ful culprit on the shoulder with her ready fan, in a stern
whisper, scarcely less audible than the child’s impulsive tribute
to the great tragedian, she asked, “ How can you bemean
yourself so far, miss, to the disgrace of the school?” and
beckoning the child forth, she was passed to Miss Nuttall at
the very back of the box, sobbing more for Mrs. M‘Gibbon
than for Mrs. Broadbent.
This caused a change of places, which brought Miss Ashton
more prominently into view. Laurence Aspinall, an ardent
admirer of beauty, put his hand on the shoulder of the ofﬁcer
before him, and said—“ Good heavens, Walmsley ! Do you see
that lovely creature in Mother Broadbent’s box P”
“ Which?” was the obtuse answer,
“Which!” (contemptuously echoed.) “ The divine beauty
in celestial blue. Who is she?” And his admiring gaze
brought a conscious blush to the young lady’s forehead,
although the querist was beyond her hearing.
“ In blue?” And Walmsley lazily scanned the group.
“ Oh! that’s Charlotte’s cousin, Augusta'Ashton ! Yes, she is
rather pretty ;” and the married man turned away to the stage.
“ Rather pretty ! She’s an angel! You must introduce me!”
“ Well, well!” answered the other testily, anxious to end a
colloquy which distracted his attention from the tragedy, “ I’ll
see. But she’s only a school-girl—not yet sixteen !”
“Egad! but she looks seventeen, and she’ll mend 'of that
disqualiﬁcation every day ;” and still he kept his eyes on
Augusta in a manner extremely disconcerting, though her
romantic little heart ﬂuttered, for in him she recognised the
“ Adonis ” who had reared his horse so threateningly in front of
her Uncle Chadwick’s house.
The green curtain came down amid universal plaudits.
Ladies rose to rest themselves and chat, as was the custom.
Gentlemen quitted their seats to join friends elsewhere, to
lounge in saloon or box~lobby, or to take a hasty glass at the
“ Garrick’s Head” adjoining.
Amongst the latter were Walmsley and Aspinall; but they
did not return when the prompter’s bell rang the curtain up.
There was a pas de deux of Tyrolean peasants by the chief
dancers of the company. Then followed an interlude, and
then a comic song, all before the last piece ; but the comrades
did not return; and Augusta found herself wondering whether
the handsome ofﬁcer, with the rich copper-coloured hair, would
come back at all.

They did make their appearance during the progress of the
drama (Monk Lewis’s “ Castle Spectre,” in which Mrs.
M‘Gibbon gave ocular demonstration that she was not killed),
both seemingly exhilarated, but they left again before the
' drama concluded.
Well drilled as were Madame Broadbent’s pupils, they could
not quit their box in the same order they entered it——big people
so seldom recognise the right of little ones to precedence.
They straggled into the saloon, separated by the crowd. There
Madame Broadbent, assisted by Miss Nuttall, collected her
brood, and passing on to the box-lobby, they looked around for
their respective attendants.
There was one—a ﬁne young man, in height some ﬁve feet
ten—who sprang forward with shawl and calesh for Miss
Ashton, at the same time bowing deferentially to the pompous
dame with the big fan. He proceeded to adjust the shawl
round the dimpled shoulders so very precious to him, and
said—-
“ I hope you have had a pleasant evening, Miss Augusta.”
Then bowing again to Mrs. Broadbent, he offered his hand
respectfully to the young lady, to conduct her home.
On the instant they were intercepted by Aspinall and Walms-
ley, neither so sober as he might have been.
“ Augusta, here’s my friend, Aspinall ; deuced good fellow——
quite struck with you,” was Captain Walmsley’s unceremonious
introduction—at a time, too, when introductions were some-
what formal.
“Quite, Miss Ashton,” he assented. “ ’Pon my soul, I am !
Your charming face has quite captivated me, and those eyes
pierce my heart like bullets. Permit me to escort you home.”
There was an amusing consciousness of his own attractions
in this free expression of his admiration. A woman of the
world, with her weapons ready, might have dismissed him
either with hauteur, badinage, or cool indifference ; but to
Augusta Ashton, almost a child in years, it was bewildering and
disconcerting. I
Her eyes fell—her colour rose. She stood silent, abashed,
and confused. Native modesty took alarm.
Jabez came to her relief.
“Miss Ashton is under my protection, sir; she requires no
other escort.”
The words were cool as those of a man who, having his
temper well under control, did not choose to quarrel, though his

The [Manchester Man. 16 5
pulses were beating like drums. With cool eﬁ‘rontery his old
antagonist looked him full in the face.
“So it’s you again, yellow-skirt ! A nice fellow to protect a
pretty girl : a fellow without skill to defend himself, or spirit to
resent an insult ;” and the speaker’s red lips curled with
derision.
The eyes of Jabez kindled and his teeth set. There was no
lack of spirit, but not the spirit of which common brawls are
made. He was anxious to get the trembling Augusta away
from the gathering crowd.
Madame Broadbent, shorn of half her pretty train, came up
aghast. ‘
“ Young lady! Miss Ashton ! What is ”
A wave of the silver-braided sleeve set her aside, chafed and
indignant at the freedom and impertinence.
“ Keep out of the way, Mother Broadbent. Look after the
rest of your lambkins. Miss Ashton’s cousin and I propose to
see your pupil home.”
“ All right, Augusta,” said Walmsley, thickly ; “ we’ll see you
home.”
But she clung in dismay to the arm of Jabez ; and not
Hercules himself could have torn her from him. Ignoring the
coarse taunt of Lieutenant Aspinall, he endeavoured to lead
her past them, simply saying to Captain Walmsley——
“Mr. Ashton committed his daughter to my care. I am
answerable for her safety.”
Aspinall, mistaking his calmness for pusillanimity, again in-
tercepted their passage, and would have taken Augusta’s hand.
But a will strong as his own~an arm strengthened by lifting
and carrying heavy burdens—was opposed to him. Jabez
struck no blow : he thrust out an arm with muscles like leather,
swept the offensive lieutenant aside, and down he went on the
stone pavement of the lobby.
“ Bravo, Clegg l” exclaimed a voice from the rear ; and the
burly form of Ben Travis parted the curious crowd, as levia-
than parts the waves, before the infuriated Aspinall could rise,
or Walmsley interpose ; “that’s right ; take the young lady
away, and leave these gallant bucks to me. I’ll guard the
honour of our corps.”
The terriﬁed young lady and the inebriated young bully were
alike in sure hands. But consequential Madame Broadbent,
ignored, forgotten, had received a blow to her importance she
was not likely to forget or overlook. '

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH.
MADAME BROADBENT’S FAN.
HEY had made their exit from the Fountain Street end
of the box-lobby, to avoid the rush from the gallery
door in Back Mosley Street, which somewhat lengthened the
short distance Jabez had to convey his precious charge,>who
appeared more apprehensive of offending Madame Broadbent
by scant and unceremonious leave-taking than troubled by the
impertinence of the young ofﬁcers.
Truth to tell, the whole adventure had a savour of Miss
Bohanna’s circulating library about it, and she felt herself ele-
vated into a heroine by the occurrence. But her appearance
before Madame Broadbent in the morning would be very real
and unromantic, that lady resenting nothing so much as
disrespect.
“ You see, Jabez, I did not even make acurtsey to her as we
came away. I am afraid she will be displeased.”
“ If you think so, Miss Ashton,” he replied, respectfully, “ I
will hasten back as soon as I have seen you safely home, and
hear your apologies to Madame Broadbent. She may not have
left the theatre. Besides, I feel that I also owe an apology for
leaving a lady of her age unprotected in the midst of such a
scene. It was very remiss on my part,” he added ,- “but, in-
deed, at the time I thought only of placing you beyond reach
of further insult ;” and Augusta could hear him mutter between
his teeth, “ The impertinent puppy l”
The distance even from Fountain Street was very incon-
siderable, and they had reached the broad steps of the door in
Mosley Street, and his hand was on the lion'headed knocker
when this ejaculation escaped him.
Service from Jabez was so much a matter of course that
Augusta regarded his care for herself, and his proffer to run
back at her bidding, only in the light of apprentice-duty ,' but
that muttered exclamation spoke of smothered passion; and
before James was roused from his doze in front of the far-away

The [Manchester Man. 167
kitchen ﬁre by that peal on the knocker, and sleepily opened
the door, she had added a caution as an addendum to her
message to Madame Broadbent.
“I hope, Jabez, you are not going back to—to interfere or
quarrel with Mr. Walmsley and the other ofﬁcer. If they are
not quite sober, you must remember they are gentlemen.”
“I will forget nothing I should remember, Miss Ashton,”
said he, as James unclosed the door for her entrance, and he
darted off, the emphasis she had laid on her closing words
having stung him keenly with a sense of his social inferiority
in her sight. “ She evidently thinks the apprentice College-boy
has no right to raise his hand against gentility in uniform, how-
ever drunk or disorderly it may be,” he thought, as he ran along,
spurred by a manly desire to show that it was not cowardice
which had caused him to leave his prostrate enemy in the
hands of a deputy.
He was not three minutes more in reaching the box-entrance
in Back Mosley Street ,- but for all that, the short walk home,
and the brief delay caused by sleepy-headed James, had given
ample time to empty and close the theatre, from which more
than half the audience had dispersed before they left. Even
the oil lamps over the doors were extinguished ; and though a
few stragglers loitered about—the natural hangers-on to his-
trionic skirts—and there were brawlers in the neighbourhood,
he saw none of those he went to seek.
The fact was, Captain Travis had hauled Lieutenant Aspinall
from the ground with little ceremony, and, with a sharp reproof
for “the disgrace he was bringing on their corps by insulting a
young lady in a public place, as if sufﬁcient odium did not
attach to the Yeomanry already,” forced him into a waiting
hackney-coach, giving the driver orders to bear him home to
his father’s house on Ardwick Green, heedless of the young
ofﬁcer’s remonstrance to the contrary. But Jehu, who knew
his fare, drove him instead to the “ George and Dragon ” on
the opposite side of the'Green, and Mr. Aspinall saw nothing
of his hopeful son that night.
Nor would Charlotte Walmsley have seen much more of her
husband, had not kind-hearted Ben gone far out of his own way
to land John safely at home. Perhaps it would be hardly fair
to calculate too nicely how far he was inﬂuenced to that‘by the
relation of the Walmsleys to Ellen Chadwick, since the secret
springs of action often lie too far down even for self-know-
ledge.

168 The Manchester Man.
As for Madame Broadbent, no sooner had Miss Nuttall
disposed of the last of the budding misses than she hid her
indignation in the deep shadow of her large calesh, and, with
an access of importance, left the theatre, slightly in advance of
her humble dependants, and made her fearless way through
Fountain Street and High street, with a step which augured
unpleasantness for all beneath her roof if her supper were not
done to a turn and served to a nicety.
Augusta was somewhat 10th to leave her pillow in the morn-
ing, after the night’s unusual dissipation, and was still more
reluctant to encounter her lessons and Mrs. Broadbent; and
she for the ﬁrst time remarked to Cicily that she thought she
was “quite too old to go to school.” As if the world was not
one huge school, wherein the dunces get punished most
severely, and even the best and brightest do not escape the
rod. But Augusta Ashton, buoyant, blooming, cherished,
admired, adored, could not see that her real schooling would
begin when Madame Broadbent’s reign ceased.
No doubt Mr. Ashton would have been coaxed into granting
an extension of his darling daughter’s Easter holiday, and
suffered her to remain at home that Thursday morning, but
he was at Whaley-Bridge ; and mamma met her request with :--
“No, my dear, you have had quite holiday enough. It
would be setting a bad example to infringe Madame Broad-
bent’s rules. Go, my dear, and g0 cheerfully. I will send
Cicily for you at noon. The streets will be rather rough this
week.”
She went, though not cheerfully, and Cicily was duly de-
spatched to bring her home; but neither Cicily nor Miss Ash-
ton had returned when dinner was put upon the table at half-
part twelve o’clock. Then Mrs. Ashton recalled her own words
respecting the rough streets, and the insult offered as un—
welcome tribute to Augusta’s beauty over-night; and, though
by no means a nervous woman, the mother grew restless and
apprehensive—a lovely daughter who is an only child is so very
anxious a charge. As she sat down to her solitary meal,
another thought crossed her mind.
“James, ask Mr. Clegg to oblige me by stepping this way.”
Mr. Clegg was with her in an instant: the summons was
unusual.
“Jabez, I’ll thank you to ascertain why Miss Ashton has
not returned from school at the usual time. Cicily has been
gone almost an hour. Should Madame be keeping her in for

any breach of etiquette last night, pray offer an apology for me
and my daughter also, but at the same time politely insist on
Miss Ashton’s immediate return to dinner."
“I believe I owe Madame Broadbent an apology myself,”
answered Jabez, smiling. “ I shall be glad of an opportunity
to discharge the debt.”
at: a as a as as
The school-room door was midway down the dark, narrow,
arched entry. Groups of girls, with slates and bags in their
hands, loitering on the pathway at the entrance and in the
passage, made way for him, with curious looks and whispers
among themselves (Jabez was not unknown to some of the
senior pupils). The school-room door stood ajar: the whole
place was in a commotion unprecedented in that precise
establishment.
Madame Broadbent, holding by the copy-slip axiom,
“ Familiarity breeds contempt,” preserved her dignity and that
of her high ofﬁce by avoiding personal contact with her pupils,
, save at stated hours. Her assistant-governesses were at their
posts from nine until twelve, from two until four ; but Madame
herself only sailed into the long room from the house-door
across the entry at eleven o’clock to receive reports, inspect
work, dispense rewards, or administer reproof and chastisement.
“Spare the rod and spoil the child ” had not been abolished
from the educational code ﬁfty-ﬁve years back.
The double shock her importance had received at the
theatre sent her home to quarrel with her supper; and as a
meal. dispatched in an ill-humour does not easily digest, Othello
and the Castle Spectre haunted her pillow, and broke her rest
with nightmares.
She rose late, and stepped into her schoolroom later than
usual, to visit her accumulation of disagreeables on minor
delinquents, as well as on the primary offenders.
Let us be just : Madame Broadbent had gracious smiles and
approving words to dispense to the ultra-good, and their very
rarity made them valuable. But if she rewarded any that day,
it was only that severity might stand out in contrast. Little
hearts beat, little ﬁngers plied industrious needles, little eyes
bent over work, when Madame’s step was heard in the entry;
but when her august presence fairly ﬁlled the room, every
little damsel rose simultaneously, and saluted her entrance with
a low, formal, deferential curtsey.
Two rooms had evidently been thrown into one to give

required space, the back portion being curiously lit by a narrow
small-paned window extending along the side, high above the
rows of racks and pegs. It was the writing end of the room.
Madame Broadbent occupied a seat in the front portion,
almost opposite to the door; and. as she marched towards it
with more than ordinary loftiness, and beat her fan on her table
with one peremptory tap, instead of a short rapid quiver, to
enforce her command, “ Attention, ladies l” the very youngest
of those ladies could interpret the signs portentously. Lucky
was the young lady whose work passed muster that morning ;
so many were condemned to stocks, backboard, columns of
spelling, recitations from the “Speaker ” and Thomson’s
“ Seasons,” lengths of open hem, back-stitching, or seaming !
At length Madame Broadbent, having dismissed ordinary
business, rapped her fan upon the table, and in a sharp per-
emptory tone called “ Miss Ashton ! ”—and Miss Ashton, who
had been expecting the summons all the morning, came forward
at her bidding, but not with the ordinary alacrity of pupilage.
She had left her childhood (I had almost said her girlhood)
behind her, in the box-lobby of the Theatre Royal.
“Miss Brookes l” cried the same sharp voice ; and with a
painful start the little girl who had committed such a terrible
breach of decorum before a whole theatre as to utter her
impr0mptu commentary on the tragedian’s art, rose, trembled,
burst into tears, but was too agitated to obey with sufﬁcient
promptitude. Her seat was on a low front form. Madame
took a step forward, stretched out her arm, and dragged the
child by the ear to the side of Augusta, then gave her a smart
cuff as an admonition to more prompt obedience another time.
Then with another rap of her fan on the table, which set all
hearts pa'lpitating, she began an inﬂated harangue to the mite
of. a child and the budding woman, in which she reproached
them both with bringing disgrace on the “Academy,” hitherto
so irreproachable. The one had drawn the attention of a
whole theatre to her ill-breeding and want of proper training ;
the other by “ boldness of look and manner had licensed the
free speech of loose men ; ” and, as if that were not enough,
had “been the cause of an unpardonable insult to herself.”
She, Madame Broadbent, so highly honoured and respected by
the chief people in the town, to be called “Mother Broad-
bent ! "—it was an outrage not to be endured !
' Her temper interrupted her oration; she shook Augusta.
Violently, and condemned her to remain in school until she

had learned one of Mrs. Chapone’s letters by heart. Then
she darted on the smaller M‘s; as the primary cause of all,
shook her till the little teeth chattered, and dragged her by the
lobe of the ear towards a dark closet, set apart for heinous
offenders.
Something akin to rebellion had been growing in Augusta’s
breast all the morning. She was a girl of quick impulses and
sympathies, and was not only struck by the disproportion of
punishment meted out, but by the terror on the little one’s
face. She threw herself in their path, and to the utter astonish-
ment alike of pupils and teachers laid hold of the child to re-
lease her, exclaiming as she did so, “You shall not lock her in
the dark! you will kill her with fright, you cruel Madame
Broadbent l ”
If Madame Broadbent had been wrathful before she was
furious now. Never in her long experience had she been so
braved. Without thought, without premeditation, she raised
her heavy fan and struck sharply at Augusta. The blow fell on
her beautiful bare neck, the collar-bone snapped, as it will do
with a very slight matter, and Augusta dropped !
Cicily, waiting outside at the time, heard Madame’s raised
voice and Augusta’s impetuous remonstrance ; then a thud, a
fall, and a suppressed scream from the girls; and without
pausing to knock, she pushed open the door, Cicily had been
too long the recipient of Augusta’s school-girl conﬁdence to
stand in much awe of Mrs. Broadbent at best of times. Now
she darted forward to raise her young mistress, whom she
almost worshipped, and certainly did not consult either
Madame’s feelings or dignity in the epithets she launched at
her.
No one had been more electriﬁed at the effect of that stroke
with the fan than Mrs. Broadbent’s self. She seemed petriﬁed,
and Cicily’s indignant outburst fell on deaf ears ; but as Miss
Nuttall ran for water, and Cicily cried out for a doctor, she
roused to self-consciousness, and closed the school-room door
as if to keep the outer world in ignorance of what was going
on inside.
A wide latitude was then allowed for school discipline ; but
even Madame Broadbent was sensible that the blow which had
felled Mr. Ashton’s only daughter was a blow to imperil her
seminary.
Augusta did not revive. Miss Nuttall suggested that the
school should be dismissed, and a doctor fetched ,' and, before

either could be effected, Jabez was on the spot. He took in
the scene at a glance ; Augusta, white as her frock, her hair all
in disorder, lay extended on a form, her head supported by the
kneeling Cicily, whilst excited girls and teachers ﬂocked help-
lessly around.
“Good heavens ! what is the matter P What has happened
to Miss Ashton ? ” was his hurried and agitated inquiry.
One said one thing, one another. Wrathful Cicily came
nearest to the mark. “ That old wretch has struck ar darlin’
wi’. her great fan. Aw’m afeared her neckbone’s brokken ! ”
“Impossible! She could not be so heartless!” he cried,
as the group made way for him to pass, and he knelt down
opposite to the sobbing Cicily, on the other side of the form,
and sprinkled the pallid face so dear to him with water some
one had brought in. .
There was no sign of revival. “ My God ! this is terrible !
Oh, madam, how could you do it? Mrs. Ashton will be dis—
tracted ! ” and he started to his feet, inexpressible anguish in
every feature. “But this is no time for revilings. Where is
the nearest doctor ? ”
“There is Mr. Campbell in Hanover Street—and——”
Brushing unceremoniously past his informant, he was with
the Scotch surgeon before Miss Nuttall had recovered from her
surprise, or Madame from her stupor. .
Mr. Campbell was quickly on his way to attend his new
patient, and Jabez speeding towards the top of Market Street.
There he hired a Hackney coach from the stand, close as he
was to home, and drove straight to Dr. Hull’s. He bore the
doctor from his unﬁnished dinner with impetuosity, brooking
no delay. They found Augusta Ashton faint, pale, but restored
to consciousness, in Madame’s own dingy parlour, where the
author of the mischief was doing her best to put a favourable
colour on the disaster.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH.
RETROSPECTIVE.
HE collar-bone was broken ; there was no mistake about
that; but Jabez, mindful of Mrs. Ashton’s protracted
anxiety, lingered no longer where 'he would fain have remained
than to see the surgeon prepare—under Dr. Hull’s supervision
—to reduce the fracture ; a delicate process, since to the collar-
bone no splints can be applied.
Augusta’s affection for her mother overcame her pain.
“You will be careful how you tell mamma, Jabez, I know ,'
do not frighten her more than you can help; she will be so
terribly distressed,” faintly murmured she, as he again departed.
With all his haste and care, so much time had been spent,
Mrs. Ashton’s fears had already conjured up all manner of
evils, all of course wide of the mark. That something was
wrong she felt assured, and he found her dressing to follow her
dilatory messengers. The stoppage of the coach and his evi-
dent agitation were conﬁrmatory ; but the absolute facts roused
as much indignation as grief.
Yet Mrs. Ashton never forgot herself; and though the wait-
ing coach bore her to Bradshaw Street, to add her maternal
reproaches to the wrathful utterances of Cicily, the rough re-
bukes of Dr. Hull, and the prickings of Madame Broadbent’s
own conscience, the natural dignity of her manner more over-
awed and impressed the resentful schoolmistress than all which
had gone before. She was as profuse in apologies as in ex-
tenuating pleas, but she was not prepared to combat Mrs. Ash-
ton’s proverbial argumentation.
“Facts are stubborn things, madam, and she who cannot
govern herself is not ﬁt to govern others.”
Neither coach-making nor road-making had reached the
acme of perfection, and Augusta’s removal home, without the
displacement of the bone, had to be considered.
A sedan chair—the last in the town—was still kept for in-
valid use at the Inﬁrmary. Jabez was aware of this, and be-

fore Dr. Hull could make the suggestion he had proposed to
go for it, and was back with the black, brass-nailed sedan long
before the doctors thought their patient ﬁt to be removed.
As the unfamiliar vehicle waited at the “Academy” door,
it attracted the notice not only of neighbours and returning
school-girls, but of passers-by, until Madame Broadbent was in
a fever. The reputation of her school was at stake, and she
felt that every extra moment that hand-carriage and wheel-
carriage remained standing there, the bruit of the lamentable
occurrence was spreading farther aﬁeld. _
There had been no cessation of afternoon school duties,
albeit the teachers alone presided, and discipline was some-
what relaxed. But when patient, doctors, friends, and vehicles ‘
had gone their way, and the school was soon after dismissed,
the harrassed, agitated, and prescient disciplinarian surrendered
herself to alternate ﬁts of hysteria, passion, lamentation, and
overweening assumption.
That ﬁrst outburst over, the self-important dame stood on
her “right to maintain discipline,” even when confronted by
Mr. Ashton, no longer the easy-going, pleasant parent of a
paying pupil, but the angry father of an injured only child,
who had posted from Whaley-bridge, on the ﬁrst intelligence of
the mischance, leaving his business incomplete.
Not alone to the inmates of the house in Mosley-street was
Augusta Ashton precious. Notwithstanding her sometime way-
wardness (the result of her father’s over-indulgence), she had
endeared herself, by her affectionate heart and winsome ways,
to a wide circle of friends; even Joshua Brookes was less grim
with Augusta 5 so no wonder Jabez was secretly devoted to her
heart and soul. Great and general was the sympathy ex-
pressed on the occasion.
Mrs. Chadwick and Ellen were with Mrs. Ashton before the
afternoon was out, and at Augusta’s eager desire her cousin
remained behind, not only for companionship, but as chief
nurse, an ofﬁce for which Ellen had that peculiar ﬁtness ob-
servable in some women, coupled with the deftness and
experience gained in long attendance on her father.
And now, leaving Augusta in the hands of love and skill,
with all that affection and wealth can lavish upon her in
furtherance of recovery, let us step backwards to the previous
September, when Peterloo was fresh, and Jabez yet wore his
left arm in a sling.
Whaley-bridge has been mentioned more than once, for in

The Mahehester Man. 175
that village, near the high road from Manchester to Buxton, Mr.
Ashton possessed a water-mill on the picturesque banks of the
river Goyt, which there divided the counties of Cheshire and
Derbyshire. It had been established in the previous century,
together with another in the contiguous vale of Taxal, by a
speculative ancestor of Mrs. Ashton, whose old hall was in the
locality. The two places had been chieﬂy colonised by his
workpeople, many of whom had been pauper apprentices from
Manchester and Warrington.
Besides the mill, Mr. Ashton owned the “ White Hart ”
Inn, close to the bridge, where the Buxton coaches stopped ;
and Carr Cottage, a long, low, rough-cast building, nestling
under the shadow of a ﬁne old farm—house which crowned the
elevated ridge of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley, lang-syne the Gothic
' stone Hall of the warlike Yeardsleys;
From this farm-house, Carr Cottage was separated by a
retired walk at the back, which, itself a wilderness of nettles,
gave access to the cellarage and a clear well, and led the ad-
venturer away up the hill between the cottage grounds and the
farmer’s tall high-banked hedges, which almost overtopped the
cottage roof. And on the left of the cottage (as viewed from
the high road) spread the granaries, stabling, and farmyard,
enclosed by remains of the ancient wall, and entered by a step
or two through an ancient Gothic doorway, over which ivy and
honeysuckle clambered in luxurious rivalry.
The cottage, which on each ﬂoor contained four capacious
rooms in its length, was on the ground divided in the middle
by a respectable lobby; the house-place and kitchen lying on
-the left, the parlours to the right as you entered. There were
two staircases, one at each end of the building, the one
running upwards in the kitchen itself, the other from a small
enclosed space at the back of a parlour, containing also a china
closet door, and lit by a low window close to the foot of the
staircase, from which it was possible to step out into the
garden, unseen by anyone in the house. Otherwise, both
chambers and parlours had doors of communication from end
to end of the building, the two middle chambers being only
accessible through the others.
The lower windows in the front—at least, those of the large
parlours—were brought close to the ground, and overlooked a
charming landscape ,- descending, at ﬁrst suddenly, from the
wide-spread ﬂower-garden (with its one great sycamore to the
right of the cottage for shade), then with a gradual slope to a

bean-ﬁeld below, to a meadow crossed by a narrow rill, then,
after a wider stretch of grass, the alder and hazel fringe of a
trout-stream, skirting the high road, on the far side of which
tall poplars waved, and in Autumn shed their leaves in the
wider waters of the Goyt fresh from the bridge, where the road
bends. Rivulets, road, and river ran parallel. And from the
road a broad wooden gate gave access (over a bridge across the
trout stream) to a wide, steep avenue between trim hedges,
which rose to the level of the cottage, in itself as delightful a
retreat as any wearied denizen of town could desire. To Mr.
Ashton it was necessary as an adjunct to his factory ; an occa-
sional home for his family in the summer, a lodge for himself
when a visit of inspection was desirable. '
Hearing that the general discontent was spreading amongst his
own work-people at Whaley-bridge, Mr. Ashton, without wait-
ing for the stage-coach, put himself into a long-skirted drab
overcoat, with high collar and small double cape, ordered re-
luctant James to “ ﬁnd another‘for Clegg,” and having stowed
away a carpet bag and a case of pistols, lest they should be
molested on the road, he mounted his high gig, with Jabez by
his side, and set off to “take the bull by the horns,” as Mrs.
Ashton had advised.
Away they went through the mild September air, up London
road (where houses had been growing in the years since we
scanned it last) and past Ardwick Green Pond, where a dash-
ing young buck, booted and spurred, lounged at the door of
the quaint “George and Dragon,” and followed them
curiously with his eyes ; yet not so swiftly but Jabez had time
to recognise with accelerated pulse his former assailant,
Laurence.
Longsight, Burnage, Fallowﬁeld left behind ,' Stockport-
bridge gained, they go walking by their horse’s head up the
steep hill, between frowning houses, to the “ Pack-Horse” in
the Market-place, where the beast was baited, and the travellers
dined at the same table, Jabez not for one moment forgetting
the social distance between his master and himself.
Again seated, they quickly left the smoke-begrimed, higgledy-
piggledy mass of brick and mortar called Stockport behind,
and were away on country roads, where yellow leaves were
blown into their faces, where brown-faced, White-headed cottage
children were stripping blackberries from the wayside brambles,
or ripe nuts from the luxuriant hazels which have since changed
the very name of the Bullock-Smithy through which they drove_
at a gallop to Hazelgrove.‘


## p. 177 (#189) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 177
It was a glorious treat for Jabez, was that drive, and Mr.
Ashton, conversing with him as they went, was surprised to dis-
cover his love of Nature, and his knowledge of her secrets.
This induced reminiscences of the early years of Jabez when
Simon took him pick-a-back in the ﬁelds on Sundays ; and Mr.
Ashton led him on to dilate on his childhood among his ﬁrst
friends, until he had a closer insight into the young man’s
heart than in all the years he had served them.
But the object of their journey had not been forgotten ; and
at Disley, hearing Mr. Ashton remark that they were but three
miles from Whaley-Bridge, Jabez ventured to suggest—
“ Do you not think, sir, as I am unknown in Whaley-Bridge,
I might make inquiries, and ascertain the feeling of the people
better if I went on foot, having no apparent connection with
you ? ”
“ That is a wise thought of yours, young man. Just so. I
will put you down at the next milestone. Here is a guinea for
your expenses at the ‘White Hart.’ But country people are
inquisitive ; what do you propose to be P”
“ Well, sir, I took the liberty to bring a sketch-book with me
——I don’t get many such opportunities—I could represent my-
self as an artist 3 or I could cram my pockets with plants and
roots as I went along, and say I was a botanist in search of
specimens.”
“Stick to the artist, Jabez; our country botanists would
soon ﬂoor you on their own ground—they know more of plants
than pencils, I’ll warrant.” And Mr. Ashton, handing the reins
to Jabez, took a pinch of snuff on the strength of it.
Mr. Ashton, putting up the collar of his coat, drove direct
to Carr, much to the surprise of his unprepared overlooker
and wife, who had charge of the cottage. He said nothing of
any companion ; and Jabez some twenty minutes later walked
into the bar of the “ White Hart,” dusty and weary, as if with
long walking; called for bread-and-cheese and ale ; intimated
his intention to remain the night, if he could have a bed ; talked
of the scenery, and led the host to tell of the best points for
sketching.
Professing fatigue, he kept his seat in the bar-parlour the
remainder of the day. The sling, not yet wholly discarded,
drew attention, as he expected it would. The incomers, eyeing
him askance, talked politics before him, and ﬁnding him less
glib than themselves, whispered that he was a refugee from
Peterloo, and, to show their sympathy with the party to'which

he was supposed to belong, freely discussed the political aspect
of the district before him.
He was young, free with his money, and they were not reti-
cent. He found that the overlooker had made himself, and
his master through himself, obnoxious to his weavers, and that
only prompt measures would prevent an outbreak.
The next morning Mr. Ashton put his head into the inn,
greeted “ Mr. Clegg ” as some one he was surprised to meet in
so remote a spot, and invited him to Carr Cottage.
Jabez accepted the invitation for the afternoon, saying he
could not spare the morning. Under pretence of sketching,
he took his way by the Goyt to the neighbourhood of the mill
with pencils and sketch-book ; women and children ﬂocked
inquisitively round him in their dinner-hour, and talked to him;
then he rested in a weaver’s cot, and when he found his way to
Carr in the afternoon, and sat with Mr. Ashton for privacy
under the dropping keys of the sycamore, he had brought with
him the key to the prevailing discontent.
Mr. Ashton listened, took an enormous quantity of snuff,
dropped an occasional “Just so,” and, knowing the sore,
set about healing it. He drove back to Manchester, leaving
Jabez as his temporary deputy—high honour for so young
a man—and the overlooker was required to render up his
accounts.
A fortnight later, as Jabez was midway up the avenue to
Carr in the afternoon, he turned, hearing the blithe bugle of
the coming Buxton coach, and watched its dashing progress
along the road. To his astonishment it stopped at the gate.
He himself reached the spot at a run.
His eyes had not played him false. Simon Clegg, in his
best clothes, was there on the box seat; Tom Hulme and
Bess and little Sim sat close behind him. Mr. Ashton was
himself an inside passenger.
In the bustle and confusion of alighting, and dragging boxes
from the boot and from the top, curiosity was kept on the stretch.
It was not until the entire party were under the roof of the
cottage that Jabez was enlightened. Tom Hulme was the
new overlooker, Bess the new caretaker of Carr Cottage, which
was henceforth their rural rent-free home; and to Simon, long
disqualiﬁed by rheumatism for the wet and slush of the tannery,
was given the charge of the garden, with a boy under him.
And of all the group old Simon and little Sim were most
delighted.

The Manchester Man. 179
Some eight months before, Sim (then about two years old)
had slipped on the frosty stones in the old Long Millgate Yard
and, rolling down its rugged declivity, was supposed to have
injured his spine, and he had been too delicate ever since to
run about freely. To the child, therefore, whose shoulders
seemed unnaturally high, the change from the stiﬂing court
was something too exuberant for expression. To Simon
Clegg, who, in losing his crony Matt, had felt the old haunts
oppressive, the bountiful expanse of nature before him, and
the comfortable fragrant home, were matters of deep thank-
fulness.
“Moi lad,” said he to Jabez, when the latter was about to
depart with Mr. Ashton, after they were fairly inducted, “ar
Bess said thah would be a Godsend to us, an’ thah has bin.
This Paradise 0’ posies has 0’ grown eawt o’ thy cradle. God
bless thee !” ' ‘
“ I think, my dear, the experiment will succeed. There is a
matronly air of respectability about Mrs. Hulme, that will help
to uphold her husband’s position amongst the workpeople, and
I (Elan trust his soldierly discipline for keeping the rebellious in
or er.” '
Thus said Mr. Ashton to his good lady, sitting by the ﬁre-
side after supper, the night of his return home. Then, after a
little pondering and triﬂing with his snuff-box, he added, as if
reﬂectively— -
“It is all very well, my dear, to serve the young man’s
friends and ourselves at the same time, but I should like to do
something for Jabez himself. It is entirely to his clear head
and his tact that we owe the preservation of peace at Whaley-
Bridge. I should like to give him a rise.”
“ My dear William, make no more haste than good speed,
and never do things in a hurry,” replied his calm proverbial
philosopher. “We must not excite the envy of his fellow-
clerks, or we shall surround him with enemies from the ﬁrst.
In removing his humble friends you have cleared one barrier
to his advancement.”
Mr. Ashton did not say “Just so 1” for a wonder; he turned
his gold box round and round in his ﬁngers, and at length
gave utterance to a thought which took Mrs. Ashton by sur-
prise.
“If we remove all the young man’s old associations, don’t
you think we ought to provide him with new ones P ”
“ I think. William, we ought to ‘leave well alone ,-

paths are slippery paths. The young man will be out of his
time in six months; you can then advance him if you think
proper—in the warehouse—but I do not feel disposed to open
our drawing-room to him if that is what you are driving at; ”
and she drew herself up as if her dignity had received a blow.
“We-ll no—-not exactly 1” and Mr. Ashton, unable to ex-
press what he did mean exactly, shufﬂed and ﬁdgeted till he
upset his snuff on the Brussels carpet.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH.
ON THE PORTICO STEPS.
ETWEEN that expedition to Whaley Bridge, with its
terminal connubial conversation, and the break-
age of Augusta Ashton’s collar-bone, rather more than six
months intervened—six months during which Mr. Clegg, as
his good master had anticipated, felt the solitary state of his
trim sitting-room somewhat oppressive, the permission to receive
his old friends becoming a nullity on their removal. He occu~
pied a position midway between parlour and kitchen—above
his old asso¢iates of the porringers, the ﬁreside settle, and the
sanded stone ﬂoor, and beneath the family seated round the
tea-urn, on cushioned chairs and Brussels carpet. Towards
the former he cast few backward looks of regret—he had put
his past behind him—but, oh! who shall tell his unuttered
longings for the “Open Sesame !” to that paradise of which
he had had one rapturous glimpse, and one only—that para-
dise where his master’s daughter, so high above him, moved
like a seraph, and ﬁlled the air with harmony !
I am afraid that at this time he brooded over his orphan-
hood, and that unknown father who had disappeared so mys-
teriously, and strained his soaring thoughts in their ﬂight
towards possibilities more than was good for him. He was
too much alone for one of his years, and there were times in
those long candle-lit winter evenings, when books and pencils
dropped from his wearied hands, and for lack of a companion
he held dreamy converse with the ﬁre.
Of course his library was restricted, and there were no
institutions in Manchester at that time where young men of
his class could meet for mutual improvement, or that mental
polish caused by the attrition of mind upon mind. Occasion-
ally, at long intervals, and at ﬁrst to the utter confusion of
James, Captain Travis had inquired for “ Mr. Clegg,” and been

shown into the little sitting-room, with a disregard to “caste ”
very creditable to both of them; and now and then Mr.
Chadwick and Mr. Ashton would drop in together for half-an—
hour’s chat, the gratitude of the former being deeper than the
surface.
But rarely did a feminine face save Cicily’s brighten up his
solitude, and she, devoted to her young mistress, had always
something to say about Augusta, if only what she wore or how
she looked, which sent him off into dreamland immediately.
Sunday was a very chequered day, when he missed his old
friends most. True, he followed the family to church, per-
haps carried Augusta’s prayer-book, exchanged a word of
kindly greeting with old Mrs. Clowes, and Parson Brookes,
who was not as hale as he had been; but there was no old
Simon to grip his hand, no Bess to give him a motherly smile,
and unless the weather was ﬁne enough for a ramble in the
ﬁelds with Nelson for companion, the rest of the day was very
dull indeed.
The fan which broke Augusta’s collar-bone broke down a
barrier for Jabez. No personal sacriﬁce attended the service
he rendered. He but went and came as an active messenger.
But he went and came with intelligence and promptitude, and
exercised for mother and daughter both the care and fore-
thought of a much older man.
In the father’s absence the father was not missed. What
came under Mrs. Ashton’s own eye Mrs. Ashton could appre-
ciate, and the commendation of Dr. Hull was not without its
weight. He had said,
“Capital fellow to send for a doctor, that messenger of
yours, Mrs. Ashton ! A determined, persistent fellow l Would
see me, and haul me off with only half a dinner, though I pro-
tested, and he had already got a surgeon there before me 1”
His thought about the sedan chair, which he had accom-
panied to Mosley Street to insure care on the part of the
chairmen, and had ordered into the very lobby of the house;
the cautious manner in which he had lifted Augusta thence,
and borne her to the ready couch, coupled with his protection
of her daughter in the theatre the night before, weighed down
the scale already trembling in the balance, and Mrs. Ashton’s
“Jabez, I am deeply indebted to you,” was not mere words.
He was her messenger to the Chadwicks, her amanuensis to
Mr. Ashton; and when Ellen and her mother arrived some-
where about tea-time, for the second time he was invited to

join their party; and one, if not two, pair of cheeks burned
as the invitation was given.
Then, the night Mr. Ashton returned home, to ﬁnd Augusta
an invalid, he was gratiﬁed to see,]abez again at the tea-table,
and after that at odd times, until the restraint upon him
gradually wore away, and he would read to Augusta and
Ellen, as the latter sat at work, and do his best to make the
time pass pleasantly.
Next Mr. Ashton took it into his head to teach him back-
gammon and cribbage, to help to make his own evenings at
home more lively.
And Mrs. Chadwick, who for some occult reason had re-
sisted her husband’s desire to show courtesy to his preserver,
could scarcely be less gracious than her grander sister, who
owed him so much less; so now the green-parlour door in
Oldham Street was opened to him, and as Jabez refreshed
his memory with Hogarth’s prints, he felt that he had made
another step up the ladder.
Those were halcyon days; while Augusta, too tall to be
robust, recovered so slowly, and was so much gratiﬁed by his
attempts to entertain her. Halcyon days for more than one.
Yet, ere Jabez was out of his apprenticeship, or Augusta
had left her pillowed sofa, a pebble was thrown into the
stream which broke the surface of the tranquil waters, and
disturbed them for ever.
Mr. Ashton was one of the original shareholders in the
Portico, a classic stone building erected in 1806 as a library
and reading-room, on the other side of Mosley Street, which,
with its pillaredfaeade and ﬂight of steps, like an Ionic temple,
looked down on the plain red-brick front of the Assembly
Rooms, though its opposite neighbour stood quite as high in
repute, and was equally exclusive in its constitution.
Mr. Aspinall, the Cannon Street cotton-merchant (who
dined with the Scramble Club, instituted by business men
whose homes were in the suburbs), was likewise a shareholder
in the Portico ,' and from constant meeting at the long tables
within the book-shelved, galleried walls of its lofty reading-
room, he and Mr. Ashton had a tolerably lengthy acquaint-
ance, although it had never ripened into intimacy—the men
were so dissimilar.
Charlotte Walmsley was naturally troubled by the result of
Madame Broadbent’s notions of discipline, and not unnaturally
(considering the condition in which Ben Travis had taken him

home) blamed her husband as the primary cause. As naturally
he shifted the onus to the shoulders of Laurence Aspinall, and,
taking him to task, plainly told him he ought to apologise.
Laurence snatched at the proposal.
“ My dear Jack, nothing would please me better ! I’ll make
a. thousand apologies, if you’ll only introduce me.”
John Walmsley had had quite enough of introductions ; be-
sides, he stood in some awe of Mrs. Ashton, and did not know
how she might take it, especially as his friend Aspinall had
ac uired the character of “a wild spar ” He emphatically
dec ined. But if Laurence Aspinall once set his mind on a.
thing he would attain it, if within the range of possibility,
whether by fair means or foul, whatever might be the con-
sequences.
For a few days he was on his best behaviour at home ; and
having won his father over by expressions of deep contrition,
and promises of reformation, and the assurance that he would
never again do anything “unbecoming a gentleman,” he pre-
vailed on him to introduce him to Mr. Ashton, with a view to
making his own apologies in person.
“Well, Laurence, you can go with me to the Portico to-
morrow morning, and if Mr. Ashton is there we will see what
can be done ; ” the tone in which this was said clearly implying,
“If we seek an introduction to the Ashton’s for the purpose of
making the amena’e honorable as beﬁts gentlemen, there can be
no doubt of its acceptance.
But when they met Mr. Ashton on the steps of the Portico
the following morning, the self-complacence of the lofty
gentleman received a slight but uncontemplated check.
Mr. Ashton nodded to Mr. Aspinall with a beaming face, and
would have passed his acquaintance with a mere “ Good morn-
ing,” but the other stopped, and after shaking hands, and
remarking that trade was slack, presented, with due formality,
the handsome, elegant six feet of dandyism who bore him
company.
“ Mr. Ashton, let me make you acquainted with my so“, sir
—Mr. Ashton, my son Laurence ; Laurence, Mr. Ashton,”
The young gentleman raised his stylish beaver from his rich'
coppery curls, and bowed with courtly grace in acknowledg-
ment of Mr. Ashton’s formal bow, whilst his father continued,
almost in the tone of one who confers an honour——
“The fact is, my son, sir, desires an opportunity of express-
ing to Miss Ashton his deep regret for the indiscretion of which

he was guilty in the lobby of the Theatre Royal, some ten days
back,”
The smile faded from the face of Mr. Ashton, who, with a
reserve very foreign to him, put his hand into his pocket for his
snuff-box instead of extending it to the young man, and, tapping
it with a little impatience, caught at his words.
“Indiscretion, sir? What you are pleased to call ‘indiscre-
tion ’ has placed my daughter in the doctors’ hands with a
broken collar-bone.”
Before Mr. Aspinall could reply, Laurence, better skilled to
temporise, interposed.
“ So, to my inﬁnite regret, my friend Mr. Walmsley has
already informed me, sir. And I assure you I take shame to
myself that any word or action of mine should have led to con-
sequences so lamentable. No one, sir, can deplore the injury
Miss Ashton has sustained, more than myself—the unhappy
cause. It is this, Mr. Ashton, which impels me to seek an
opportunity to express the sensibility of my grave offence, and
my extreme regret, to Mrs. Ashton and Miss Ashton in person.
I cannot rest until I have implored their pardon l”
The tones in which this apologetic speech was delivered were
at once so suave, remorseful, and sympathetic that Mr. Ashton,
whose sternness was seldom of long duration, was considerably
molliﬁed. He looked at the handsome, dashing blade before
him, whose blue eyes seemed full of gentleness and pity, and
felt as though the boy he had seen torturing old Brookes, and
the yeomanry officer who had slashed at Mr. Chadwick and
Jabez Clegg, could never be one and the same. He reverted
to the latter circumstance——
“ I think, young sir, you owe an apology to someone else
under my roof—the young man who received the sabre-cut you
designed for my brother-in-law, Mr. Chadwick.”
Aspinall’s handsome face ﬂushed. His father’s quick reply
gave him time to think.
“ You surely, Mr. Ashton, would not expect my son to apolo-
gise to an apprentice-lad, a mere College-boy.”
“Just so! I would expect him to apologise to anyone he
had injured, were it a beggar ! ”
Here the son interposed : “ My good sir, do not remind
me of the horrors of that dreadful day ! I shudder when I
recall it. We acted under orders, and I swear I was utterly
unconscious and irresponsible for my actions throughout the
whole affray.”

186 The Manchester Man.
And Laurence seemed desirous to wash his hands of the
responsibility.
“The fact is,” said Mr. Aspinall, coming to his son’s rescue,
“Laurence had taken more wine than his young head would
stand on both occasions. It takes years to season a cask, you
know, Mr. Ashton, and we must not be too hard on young
fellows, if they slip sometimes. We have all had some wild
oats to sow.”
This was a platitude of the period, but Mr. Ashton’s “ Just
so i” was not a cordial assent,- and Laurence, fearing the
conversation was taking an unfortunate turn, led it back to its
original request. But Mr. Ashton tapped his box, and, offer-
ing it to his interlocutors, took a pinch himself, and then a
second, before he came to a decision. It was evidently a de-
batable question.
“I will mention your request to Mrs. Ashton, young gentle-
man, and if I ﬁnd her agreeable to receive you, I can take you
across with me tomorrow morning, provided you meet me here.
Good day.”
Mr. Aspinall’s “Good day” was somewhat stiﬁ'. He had
held his head very high all his life, metaphorically as well as
physically, and was not disposed to be snubbed by one whose
status he considered scarcely on a par with his own. He was
disposed to look on his son’s peccadilloes as some of those
“ wild oats” which young gentlemen of spirit were expected to
sow, and considered his ﬁne ﬁgure and beautiful features, his
education, accomplishments, and prospects, passports to any
society ; and that Mr. Ashton should for one moment hesitate
to open his heart and his doors to his son, was an indignity not
to be borne.
“The fact is, Laurence, that, if you make an apology to those
people after this, you have less spirit than I take you to have !”
was his conclusion.
“Never you mind, father, I know what I’m about. I want
to get my foot in there,” answered subtle Laurence. And he
managed it. '
Mr. Ashton went home to dinner full of his conversation on
the Portico steps, and set his romantic daughter’s heart in a
ﬂutter by mooting the point at issue in her presence.
“ Oh, papa! do bring him ; I want to see him again, he is
so handsome 1 ”
“ ‘ Handsome is that handsome does,’ Augusta,” was Mrs.
Ashton’s commentary on that younglady’s impulsive exclamation.

“Charlotte says he is very wild,” remarked Ellen, “ and I
feel as if I should shudder at the sight of him, after his conduct
at Peterloo.”
“You don’t shudder when Captain Travis calls, and you
don’t shut the door in John Walmsley’s face, and they may
have done things just as bad, if you did but know it, Ellen,”
retorted Augusta, standing on the defensive for the absent
“Adonis.”
“Just so, my dear, so they might,” admitted Mr. Ashton,
whilst Ellen held her peace, silenced by something in her
cousin’s retort.
“Yes, William, but look on the poor bandaged neck and
shoulders of our child, and think of that rufﬁan’s cruelty to
Jabez and others when a schoolboy. I don’t think either John
Walmsley or Mr. Travis could have done anything so bad.”
“Well, but, mamma,” argued spoiled Augusta, “ Jabez for-
gave him ; and I think Madame Broadbent is more to blame
than Mr. Aspinall-he only offered to bring me home.”
Mrs. Ashton shook her head as she rose from table.
“ Besides, mamma, he says he only wants to apologise, and
you know you need not invite him again unless you like. It
would be so rude to refuse.
“Just so, just so,” assented Mr. Ashton, willing to humour
his pet in her invalid state, “and perhaps it might do the
young fellow good to see the consequences of his folly.
As usual, where Augusta enlisted her father on her side, Mrs.
Ashton’s dissent grew feebler.
The next day Mr. Ashton made at least one false step in his
life, and brought over his own threshold a blight.
Faultless were the curves of the stylish hat, faultless the ﬁt
of pantaloons, and coat, and Hessian boots, and York-tan
gloves ,- graceful the ﬁgure they adorned ; graceful the apology
tendered so adroitly—more to the mother than to the daughter-
—but if ever a graceless good-for-nothing cast a shadow on a
good man’s hearth, it was the wolf in sheep’s clothing whose
hungry jaws were watering for the pet lamb of the fold, and
who made so courtly an exit full in the sight of Jabez, as he
crossed the end of the hall to his solitary dinner in his own
room.

CHAPTER THE T WENTY-SEVENTH.
MANHOOD.
OUN G as he was, Laurence Aspinall was wont to say he
“ wouldn’t give a ﬁg for any man who could not be any-
thing in any society ; and the Laurence Aspinall of the cock-
pit, the ring, and the bar-parlour, was a very different being from
the Laurence Aspinall of the Assembly or drawing-room. He
could be a blackguard amongst blaekguards, a gentleman
amongst ladies.
Nature had done much for him, art had done more. Nature
had given him at twenty-one a symmetrical ﬁgure, and art
an easy carriage. Nature had given him the clear pink-and-
white complexion which so often accompanies ruddy hair, and
art had trained his early growth of whisker to counteract
effeminacy of skin. Nature had given him a lofty forehead,
art had clustered his bronze curls so as to hide how much that
brow receded. Nature had given an aquiline nose, eyes
of purest azure, ﬂexile lips with curves like Cupid’s bow ,' and
art had taught that eyes set so close, whose hue was so apt to
change as temper swayed him, and lips so cruelly thin, might
be tutored to obey volition, and contradict themselves, if so
their owner willed. To crown all, nature had gifted him with
a ﬂexible voice, and art had set it to music.
The Liverpool schoolmaster had obeyed Mr. Aspinall’s in-
structions to the letter; all that education and accomplishments
could do to polish and reﬁne the physical man into the gentle-
man, as the word was then understood, had been done for
him _; but under the stucco was the rough brickwork Bob the
groom had heaped together, and which no trained or loving
hand had removed.
Be sure Laurence Aspinall did not carry this analysis into
society, written on his forehead. - Instead, he had cultivated
the art of fascination 3 and in the brief space occupied by that

apologetic introductory visit in Mosley Street he not only con-
trived to dazzle the romance-beclouded eyes of Augusta, but,
what was almost as much to his purpose, to win over Mr. Ash-
ton, and to weaken the prejudice of Miss Augusta’s less pliant
mamma. Ellen Chadwick was the only one on whom he made
no impression, the only one who retained a previous opinion—
conﬁrmed. Possibly, as Charlotte Walmsley’s sister she knew
something of his life below the surface, and had imbibed that
sister’s notion that he “led John Walmsley away. Possibly,
too, as Charles Chadwick’s daughter, she contrasted the silken
speech of the drawing-room dandy with the hectoring, sword-
in-hand, yeomanry cavalry lieutenant who, in striking at her
father, had wounded Jabez his deliverer instead.
At all events, she met the enthusiastic admiration of Augusta
after his departure, the gratiﬁed encomiums of her uncle, and
the more subdued approbation of her aunt, with the unvarying
expression, “ He would have murdered my dear father but for
Jabez Clegg, and Mr. Clegg is worth a hundred of him.”
Mr. Laurence knew better than to presume on that introduc-
tion all at once. From their gardens and greenhouses at Ard-
wick and Fallowﬁeld, he sent small baskets of early ﬂowers and
fruit to Mrs. Ashton, for her daughter, with courteous in-
quiries,- but he allowed several days to elapse before he pre-
' sented himself in person, and then his call was of the briefest.
He knew he had prejudice to overcome, and worked his way
gradually. Meanwhile Augusta progressed favourably ,' and if
Aspinall grew in favour with the family, so did Jabez.
May, sweet-scented month of promise, brought to Jabez
Clegg in 1820 his natural and legal heritage—manhood and
manhood’s freedom. He was no longer an apprentice bound
to a master by the will of others. He had a right to think and
act for himself, subject only to the laws of God and of the
realm. True, that free agency brought with it a train of
responsibilities, but the new man was not the one to overlook
or ignore the fact. He had thought long and keenly of the
coming change, and all it might involve, months before it
came.
His ﬁxed wages as an indoor apprentice, according to inden-
ture, were no great matter ; but, supplemented by coin be ex-
tracted from his paint-box after business hours, he had found a
margin for saving, besides contributing to the humble wants of
his early fosterers. The latter duty he had never neglected,
but Simon was as sternly just as the lad had been gratefully

generous. and, even when poverty bit the hardest, would never
accept the whole of his earnings.
“ Si thi, Jabez, if thah dunnot keep summat fur thisel’ to put
by fur a nest-egg, thah’ll ne’er see the good 0’ thi own earnin’s,
an’ thah’ll lose heart in toime,” the old tanner had been wont
to say, when sturdily limiting the extent to which his foster-son
should open his small purse.
So Jabez, leading a steady, industrious life, spending little on
personal gratiﬁcation, save what he invested in books, had
quite a little store laid by—the result of very small savings—
against the time when he might have to shift for himself. Two 4
things had troubled him—the possibility of having to ﬁnd a ‘
situation elsewhere, Mr. Ashton having said no word of retain- ‘
ing him, though, on the contrary, he had said nothing of his
removal; and the necessity for quitting the house which had
been to him a home so long that even the grumbling cook and
the affectionate dog had welded themselves into his daily life,
how much more the kind master and mistress, and that beatiﬁc
vision, their beautiful, bewitching daughter, who had held him
in vassalage from the very day of his apprenticeship, and
tyrannised over him as only a wayward, spoiled beauty—child
0r woman—could. ‘
The bright morning of the ﬁfth of May set this at rest. He
was called into the inner counting-house, and passed the high
stools of inquisitive-eyed, quill- driving clerks with a palpitating
heart, conscious how much depended on the issue of that
interview.
As he opened the curtained glass door, to his surprise he
found himself confronted by not only Mr. Ashton, but Mr.
Chadwick, and Simon Clegg, who had been brought from
Whaley-Bridge for the occasion.
Business men, as a rule, are not demonstrative over business,
and after the ﬁrst salutations and surprised greetings, the con-
gratulations of the day were soon said, and the stereotyped
“ And now to business ” put sentiment to ﬂight. And yet
not entirely so, as will be seen.
There was nothing luxurious in that counting-house of the
past. Besides the high desk and stool, it contained an oilcloth-
topped hexagon table, with a deep rim of partitioned drawers,
three wooden chairs, a sort of ﬁre-guard fender, and a poker ;
but there was neither carpet nor oil-cloth on the ﬂoor, and the
walls had but a dim recollection of paint.
Mr. Ashton, snuff-box in hand, occupied one of these chairs ;

Mr. Chadwick, resting hands and chin on a stout walking-stick,
another ; the third, a little apart, had been assigned to old Simon
(now on the shady side of seventy). Jabez remained standing.
Mr. Ashton, as was his manner, tapping his ﬁngers on his
snuff-box lid whilst he spoke, opened ﬁre, “N o doubt, Jabez, you
have been expecting me to say something respecting your pros-
pects and position when your indentures are given up ?”
“ Well, sir,” answered Jabez with a frank smile, “ I believe I
have.” '
“Just so! I knew you would. It was but likely. And I
should have spoken to you some time since, but for brother
Chadwick here. Both Mrs. Ashton and myself have watched
your conduct and progress, during the whole term of your
apprenticeship, with entire satisfaction.”
Here a pinch of snuff emphasised the sentence, and both
Simon and Jabez felt their cheeks begin to glow.
' “ You have been unusually steady and persevering—have not
been merely obedient, but obliging, and your rectitude does full
credit to the ‘ honourable ’ name Parson Brookes gave to you.”
This was quite a long speech for Mr. Ashton ; he paused to
take breath ; and old Simon, proud of the young man as if he
had been his own son, feeling the encomium as some sort of
halo round his own grey head, exclaimed—
“ Aw’m downreet preawd to yer [hear] yo’ say it, sir. It’ll
mak’ ar Bess’s heart leap wi’ joy.”
But Jabez, blushing, half ashamed of hearing his own
praises rung out as from a belfry, could only stammer forth—
“ I’ve endeavoured to do my duty, that is all, sir.”
“ A—ll !” interjected Mr. Chadwick, in his imperfect speech,
“ Nelson sa—said du—u—ty was all Engla~and expected of
ev—ev’ry man, but it w—won the b—battle of Tr—Trafalgar l”
“ Duty wins the battle of life, brother,” put in Mrs. Ashton,
who had quietly entered the counting-house by the door be—
hind Jabez.
“Just so, just so I” assented Mr. Ashton, as he rose and
handed his chair to the lady whose stately presence seemed to
ﬁll the room ,- “and Jabez has only to continue doing his duty
to win his battle of life, I take it. But to our business—You
have hitherto served us well, Jabez, in the warehouse and out
of it ; you have been doubly useful to me as a designer and as
a detector of the roguery and mismanagement of others.
Then, to my daughter, who is far dearer than either warehouse
or trade, you have rendered more than one service.”

“Oh, sir, do not name it, I beg. It has been my highest
pleasure to serve Miss Ashton—or yourself,” Jabez exclaimed,
the two last words rising to his lips simultaneously with the
thought that his sudden outburst might fail of appreciation by
Miss Ashton’s wealthy relatives.
“Just so l but I must name it, Jabez, as a reason for my pro-
posal to retain you in my employ, and for assigning to you a
situation and salary higher than is usually accorded to an appren-
tice just out of his time. But as you have shown stability and
judgment beyond your years, and I know you to be honourable
in all respects, I feel I am justiﬁed in making the offer.”
Mr. Ashton then stated, with a little seasoning of snuff, the
salary he proposed to give the young man, and the duties he
required as an equivalent, if Jabez accepted his proposition.
The eyes of Jabez sparkled and his cheeks glowed. As for
Simon, he seemed dumb with delight and astonishment at the
good fortune of the foundling.
“ IF 1” cried Jabez, “there can be no ‘ if,’ sir ; you over-
power me with an offer so far above my deserts. I accept it
most gratefu ”
“Stay, Mr. Clegg,” interrupted Mrs. Ashton, as Mr. Chad-
wick raised his head from its rest on his hands and stick, and
made an ineffectual effort to speak. ‘ “ ‘ Think twice before you
speak once,’ my bro ”
“Oh, madam 1 there is no need,” Jabez began, but she
silenced him with a mere gesture of her raised hand ; and
Mrs. Ashton, acting as interpreter for her slow-tongued brother-
in-law, resumed—
“ You have done us some services, Mr. Clegg, but ‘ a man
will give all he possesses for his life,’ and Mr. Chadwick feels
that his debt to you is greater than ours.”
Jabez looked from one to another, bewildered.
Mr. Ashton took up the thread—“ Just so I and that brings
me to the point we have been driving at. You see, Jabez, Mr.
Chadwick is not so capable of managing his business as he
used to be 3 things go wrong he scarcely knows how, and he
is desirous to bring some one into his warehouse on whom he
can rely. He therefore offers to take you at a higher salary
than I think at all suitable for so young a man, and if you
prove your competence to take the management within a
reasonable time, to give it over into your hands, and ultimately
—it may be in a very few years—to give you a small partner-
ship interest in the concern.”

completely stunned.
“You must not look on this altogether as a testimony to
your business qualiﬁcations, Jabez, I think,” continued Mr.
Ashton, “but as the outﬂow of a' grateful heart, and the pro-
position of a man who has no son capable of keeping his trade
together. Is not that so ?”—turning to Mr. Chadwick.
“ Cer—certainly l”
Jabez looked from one to another, then to Simon, but no
help was forthcoming from that quarter.
Mrs. Ashton came to his relief : “I think, Mr. Clegg, you
had better ‘look before you leap.’ Whatever decision you
make will equally satisfy us. But I see you need time to con-
sider. Suppose you consult your foster—father, and give Mr.
Ashton your decision at the outcome—supper to-night.”
The hesitation of Jabez was only momentary. We are told
that all the marvels and glories of Paradise were revealed to
Mahomet before a single drop of water had time to ﬂow from
a pitcher overturned in his upward ﬂight; and even whilst
Mrs. Ashton spoke, Jabez had time to think.
“ Thank you, madam,” said he, “ but I need no delibera-
tion. I know not for whose kindness to be most grateful ; but
I' do know that I should be most ungrateful if I were to quit
the master and mistress to whom both myself and my dear
friends owe so very much, for the ﬁrst tempting offer made to
me. Mr. Chadwick overrates my service ,' Mr. Mabbott
rendered quite as efﬁcient aid; besides, I have no acquaint-
ance with the manufacture of piece-goods, and have no right to
take advantage of Mr. Chadwick’s extreme generOsity, know-
ing my own disqualiﬁcations. And pardon my saying so—if
Mr. Chadwick has no mercantile son, he may some day have a
son-in-law better ﬁtted in every way for the ofﬁce and promise
held out to me.—I trust, Mr. Chadwick, you will not consider
me ungracious in declining your liberal offer, but indeed I
have been trained to the small-ware manufacture, and here lies
my duty, for here I feel I may be able to render something of
a. guz'zlpro qua.”
Before anyone had time for reply, the Inﬁrmary clock struck
twelve; and as if simultaneously, there was a rush from the
warehouse into the yard, an outcry and a din, as if Babel had
broken loose, the sacred precincts of the counting house was in-
vaded, and Jabez was carried off vi et arr/21's.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.
ONCE IN A LIFE.
the apprentice is no longer the absolute bond-slave of
his master, release from the seven years bondage is now seldom
accompanied by the active and noisy demonstration which of
old marked that epoch of a tradesman’s or an artisan’s career.
But, if the sudden uproar which chased quiet from the pre-
cincts of Mr. Ashton’s warehouse and manufactory when the
Inﬁrmary clock told noon, broke prematurely upon the con-
ference in the counting-house, it was not unexpected. Every
apprentice had been similarly greeted at the same period of his
life. Until the clock proclaimed twelve, business routine had
been undisturbed, but those twelve beats of the timekeeper’s
hammer had been the signal for every apprentice and workman
on the premises to rush pell-‘mell into the yard, each bearing
with him some implement or symbol of his trade, anything which
w0uld clash or clang being preferred. Remnants of fringe,
bed-lace, and carpet-binding, waved and ﬂuttered like streamers
from the hands of the women ,' umbrella sticks were ﬂourished ,-
strings of waste ferrules, brass wheels, brace-buckles, button
and tassel-moulds, cops, and spindles were jingled and jangled ‘
together ; tin cans were beaten with picking-rods, punches,
hammers, leather stamps, and other tools, by apprentices and
men ; whilst Jabez himself, hoisted on the shoulders of the
two smallware-weavers who had seized and borne him from his
master’s presence, claiming him as one of their own body, a
recognised lawful member of their craft, was paraded round
and round that inner court-yard, with the crowd in extempor-
ised procession, amid shouts, hurrahs, songs, and that peculiar
instrumental accompaniment which was—noise, not—music.
The household servants had crowded to the scullery door ,
clerks stood aloof under the gateway, where Simon Clegg kept

them company in an ecstasy of satisfaction ; Mr. and Mrs.
Ashton and Mr. Chadwick surveyed the proceedings from the
counting house window, whilst even Ellen and Augusta were
curious enough to look on from those back~hall steps where
they had once before received the hero of that scene, wounded,
from a very different one.
More than six years had elapsed since the last indoor ap-
prentice had been borne in triumph round that yard (Kit
Townley’s indentures had been prematurely cancelled), and
Jabez may be pardoned if he contrasted the two occasions,
and construed the wilder excitement and enthusiasm of this
in his own favour, when his employers and their daughter
noticed it also.
“It is easy to tell what a favourite Jabez must be in the
warehouse, by the uproar. The last outcome, I remember, was
quite tame beside this.” I
“Well, Augusta,” answered Ellen, “I believe he deserves it.
I know my father thinks there is not such another young man
as Mr. Clegg in all Manchester.”
“Yes, he’s very kind, and obliging, and clever, and perserving,
and all that, and I like him very well; but then you know,
Ellen, he is not a gentleman, and he is not handsome by any
means,” responded Augusta, in quite a patronising tone.
Ellen looked grave.
“He is all that is good and noble, if he was not born a
gentleman ; and I think him handsome. He has a frank
open, expressive countenance, and a good ﬁgure, and good
manners, and what more would you have P”
Augusta turned her head sharply, and looked up archly in
her cousin’s face.
“ It’s well Captain Travis does not hear you, Ellen, or he
might be jealous of the prentice-knight,” she said, banteringly.
Ellen coloured painfully. -
“When shall I make you understand that Mr. Travis is no-
thing to me ? ” asked she.
“ When my cousin makes me understand that she is nothing
to Mr. Travis,” was the quick reply, as Jabez was being borne
past for the last time, and the young ladies once more waved
their handkerchiefs in salutation.
It may be very gratifying and very triumphant to be borne
aloft on other men’s shoulders, but it is neither digniﬁed, nor
graceful, nor comfortable ; and Jabez, being carried off bare—
headed, had neither hat nor cap to wave in return. He made

the best use of his right hand, his left being required to steady
himself, yet I am afraid he was more desirous to make a good
impression on the romantic young lady muﬁled in a shawl—to
hide the swathing bandages—than on his less-attractive and
elder champion by her side.
It was half-past twelve ; the dinner-bell rang, Jabez was
lowered to term ﬁrma, and there was a general rush to the
packing-room, which had been cleared out to receive tressels
and planks for tables, and an abundant supply of cold meat,
cheese, bread, and ale, provided by the master.
And then and there, before a mouthful was cut, Mr. Ashton,
standing at the head of the table, with Mr. Chadwick by his
side, and Simon Clegg close at hand, presented Jabez with his
indentures, with many expressions of his good will and his
good opinion, and an intimation to those assembled that Mr.
Clegg would in all probability continue in his employ, an
announcement which was received with loud acclaim; and
the hungry operatives set to at the collation with right good will.
This was the master’s feast ; that of the apprentice, for
which it was customary to save up long in advance, was at
night, and held at the neighbouring “ Concert-Hall Tavern ”
in York Street, opposite to the then “Gentleman’s Concert-
Hall.”
Prior to that, however, Mrs. Ashton had somewhat to say to
the young man, and she' chose his own sitting-room to say it in.
Of course, his apprenticeship over, it behoved him to shift his
quarters,- and he had looked forward to his abdication with
regret undreamed of by Mrs. Ashton, or she would certainly
have hesitated ere she made the proposal she did. ‘
As it was, she kindly and thoughtfully considered that Jabez
had no good parental home to return to; that she had no other
use for the rooms he occupied, so she proposed to him that he
should continue to occupy them whilst he thought ﬁt, since he
had elected to remain in their service.
He had already looked at lodgings in Charlotte Street, close
at hand ; but this unexpected proposal came like a reprieve to
an exile, and he was as prompt in his acceptance as he had
been in that previohs decision which had so thoroughly

eager “Oh, madam, you cannot mean it ! You overwhelm me
with kindness. Remain under this roof! It is a privilege I
had not anticipated, and I shall be proud to embrace it i”
sent Mrs. Ashton away well pleased.

It was doubly satisfactory to ﬁnd the comforts of their home
appreciated after seven years’ experience, and to be able to re-
fute Mr. Ashton’s theory that “all young men like to shake a
loose leg, and Jabez would be too glad to escape from grumbling
Kezia’s jurisdiction to accept the offer.”
Mr. Ashton, however, did not abandon the opinion he had
formed. “ I’ll wager my gold snuff-box against a button-
mould,” asserted he, “that Clegg only said ‘ Yes ’ because
gratitude would not let him say ‘ Nay ! ’ It’s not likely a young
man would care to be always under the eyes of a master or
mistress, however steady he may be.”
Ah, but neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ashton knew there was a mag-
net under their roof, stronger than all the ordinary induce—
ments which might otherwise have drawn him away—and per-
haps it was as well for him they did not.
Simon, who was present at the time, seemed literally over-
powered with gratitude for all the good which was falling into
the lap of the child of his adoption. He, however, took his
own views of the matter, views not calculated to puff Jabez up
in his own esteem, and when Mrs. Ashton was gone he broke
011t—
“Oh, Jabez, lad ! but thah’s lit on thi feet! Thah’s bin a
good lad, aw reckon, an’ thah’s sarved thi master grader ; but
thah sees many a lad does that as never gets a lift such as thah’s
getten. An’ aw canno’ but thenk it 0’ comes 0’ that prayer 0’
thy Israelite neamesake, as aw towt thee when thou wer no
bigger nor sixpenn’orth 0’ copper. Yo’ hanna furgetten it, aw
hope P ”
No, Jabez had not forgotten it I It would be strange if he
had. Nay, only that morning, in the ﬂush of success he had
carried from the counting-house, with the buoyant presumption
of youth, a conviction that it was not so much a prayer as a
prophecy nearing fulﬁlment.
Simon brought his soaring pinions down from their Icarian
ﬂi ht.
g“ Well, lad, it may be ‘the Lord has enlarge thi coast,’ but if
So be He han, thah sees theer’s moore room fur thee to slip as
well as to stond, and theer’s moore rayson whoi thah shouldn
be thenkful and humble ! for the big book says, ‘Let him that
stondeth tak’ heed lest he fall,’ an’ aw shouldna loike t’ see thi
young yead torned wi proide.” _
His lecture was somewhat of a cold shower-bath to Jabez in
his hour of triumph, but no doubt it was salutary in its_ ulti-

mate effects. At all events, it kept the vaulting ambition of
the new man a little in check.
People—especially work-people—then observed early hours.
At seven o’clock the outcome supper was on the tables at the
“Concert Hall Tavern,” and the elder apprentices, and all
such of the workmen as were absolutely engaged on the
premises, were there to partake when Jabez found old Simon
a seat, himself taking the head of the table, with the two
senior apprentices on his right hand and left.
The cost of such suppers usually fell on the apprentice, but
sometimes, as in this case, the master added his quota. If
plain, the provision was substantial and ample. Rounds of
beef and legs of mutton, piles of ﬂowery potatoes, and red
- cones of carrot on pale beds of mashed turnip, smoked on the
board, and the two-pronged forks and horn-hafted knifes were
flanked with earthenware jugs and horns of ale.
It was the ﬁrst essay of Jabez in the art of carving, and no
doubt he made rather an unskilful president. But in the then
condition of the lower classes a large joint of meat was a rare
sight to a working-man, and so he cut away with no fear of critics.
Amidst the rattle of cutlery and crockery, and the rapid play of
jaws, beef and mutton disappeared, and were succeeded by a tre-
mendous plum-pudding—the contribution of old Mrs. Clowes—
and half a cheese, which came to the table in the then common
japanned receptacle locally known as a cheese-biggin.
Appetite and the viands ﬂed together, the noise of tongues
succeeded to the noise of knives and forks, and Lancashire
humour vented itself in jest and repartee, sometimes coarse,
but seldom mischievous. Old Simon enjoyed it immensely.
It seemed like a renewal of his own youth.
It was not, however, until the supper-table was cleared that
the chief ceremonial of the evening took place. Then an
arm-chair was mounted upon the table, in which Jabez was
enthroned, the two eldest apprentices standing also on the
table on either hand as supporters. An immense bowl of
steaming punch was brought in, which was held over the head
of Jabez by the one apprentice (when he was said to be
crowned), whilst the other, wielding the punch~ladle as a
symbol of authority, with many a theatrical grimace, began to
ladle the odorous compound into the glasses of the guests;
and the head over-looker of the manufactory, from the oppo:
site end of the table, prepared to propose the health of the
late apprentice, as a new member of their craft. ,

At this juncture in walked their master, Mr. Ashton, closely
followed by Mr. Chadwick, leaning on the arm of the Rev.
Joshua Brookes, who with many a “ pish ! ” and “pshaw !”
and “pooh!” had professed to come reluctantly, “to see a
sensible lad make a fool of himself.” Their entrance, and the
volley of cheers which greeted it, made a momentary pause in
the Proceedings. Then Mr. Ashton, being duly supplied with
a ladleful of punch, took his overlooker’s place, and the glass
serving as a substitute for his snuff-box, he proposed and drank
“ Mr. Clegg’s health and prosperity,” and welcomed him
among the confraternity of small-ware weavers.
This was succeeded by a prolonged cheer; and then, as one
by one each man’s glass was ﬁlled, ere he touched it with his
lips'he sang separately (with whatsoever voice he might happen
to have, musical or otherwise) the following toast to proclaim
the released apprentice a freeman of the trade, the chorus
being taken up afresh after every repetition of the quatrain :—
“ Here’s a health to he that’s now set free,
That once was a ’prentice bound,
And for his sake this merriment we make,
So let his health go round;
Go round, go round, go round, brave boys,
Until it comes to me;
For the longer we sit here and drink,
. The merrier we shall be.
Chorus—Go round, go round,” &c.
Mr. Ashton had ordered up another bowl of punch, and that
being distributed with like ceremony over the new small-ware
monarch’s head, Jabez, from his temporary throne, with all the
warmth of freshly-stimulated gratitude, delivered avery genuine
oration on the excellence of the master then present, and pro-
posed as a toast, “ Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, our worthy and
esteemed master and mistress.”
Now-a-days I’m afraid the master would have been dubbed
a “governor,” and the mistress ignored altogether; but though
it is only ﬁfty-ﬁve years since, servants were not ashamed to
own they had masters and mistresses, and consequently were
not above being amenable to rule. _
During this digression, at a hint from some one (I believe old
Simon), Jabez, whose eloquence must surely have come from
-the punch-bowl, dilated on the spiritual relation between the
reverend chaplain and the party assembled, there being scarcely
an individual present who had not been either baptised or

married by the Rev. Ioshua Brookes ; and he wished “health
and long life to him” with much sincerity.
A general shout rose in response, but Joshua made no other
reply than to turn on his heel (the better to hide his face), and
growl out, “Long life indeed I Ugh! pack of tomfoolery I” as
he hurried from the room, before either Mr. Ashton or his
paralysed brother-in-law could follow. Yet, in spite of his gruff
disclaimer, he added another bowl of punch to the “tom-
foolery ”—at least, one was brought in soon after, and no one
there was called upon to pay for it.
Relieved from the restraining presence of the gentlemen,
tongues wagged freely, long pipes were introduced, song, jest,
and toast succeeded each other, and as the fun grew and the
smoke thickened, they mingled confusedly, until at length
clear-headed Simon drew his arm through that of the novice,
and watching his opportunity, led him unnoticed into the open
air, with his head spinning like a teetotum.
Jabez awakened the next morning with a terrible headache,
and a dim recollection of having encountered stately Mrs.
Ashton in the hall overnight, when the very statues had
seemed to shake their heads at him, and her mild, “ Fie,
Jabez i” followed him upstairs, apparently carpeted with moss
or india-rubber for the nonce. It was his ﬁrst dissipation, and
his last. He never forgot it. And if anything was wanting
to destroy the germs of self-sufﬁciency and 'elation, it was
found in the consciousness of his own frailty, and the sense
of shame and self-reproach it engendered.
Experienced heads knew that the surrounding fumes of
liquor and tobacco had been more potential than the small
quantity of punch he had imbibed. But he did not know
it, and by the hail-fellow-well-metishness of those workmen
who were most inclined at all times to keep Saint~Monday,
and who came to their work, or stayed from their work, un-
ﬁt for their work, was a sensitive chord of his nature struck,
far more than by the quiet caution of Simon, the light badi-
nage of Mr. Ashton, or the jeers of captious Kezia.
In making light of it, Jabez felt they made light of him,
and he was long after afraid lest those whose opinion he held
in esteem should make light of him also—Augusta Ashton
chief of these.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH.*
ON ARDWICK GREEN POND.
. T was in vain Madame Broadbent waited on Mrs. and Mr.
Ashton, and solicited‘Miss Ashton’s return to her estab-
lishment on her ultimate recovery. The pupil was not more
shudderingly reluctant to be re-placed under her despotic rule
than the parents were peremptory in their refusal.
When her plea for the “ maintenance of discipline ” failed,
and she tried cajolery as ineffectually, she gaVe way to the
expression of her natural fears that it would “be the ruin of
the Academy” if Mr. Ashton did not reverse his decision. ‘
He loved his daughter too well to yield, and Mrs. Broadbent
went back to Bradshaw Street to ﬁnd, as years rolled on, .that
she had been a true prophetess.
The injury done to Miss Ashton’s collar-bone hadbeen
bruited about, and slowly but surely it helped to sap the
foundation of the once-ﬂourishing seminary. It continued to
exist for some years, but its prestige was gone, its glory de~
parted. Yet she maintained her personal importance to the
last, and exhibited her ﬂOCk in the “lower boxes ” of the
Theatre Royal on Mrs. M‘Gibbon’s beneﬁt nights with un-
diminished dignity through successive seasons.
The rapidly-ripening young lady had her will ; she had done
with the schoolroom for ever, and her lessons on the harp
from Mr. Horobin, and on the piano from George Ware, the
leader of the Gentleman’s Concerts, came under quite another
category. Nor did she think it beneath her aspirations to
retain her place in Mr. Bland’s fashionable dancing-room,
where she practised cotillons, quadrilles, and the newly-im-
ported waltz, with partners on a par with herself. But these
were aeeemplzlvhments, and we all know, or ought to know by
this time, that accomplishments require much more prolonged
and arduous application than the merely useful and essential

branches of knowledge, theorists for the higher education of
women notwithstanding.
Miss Augusta was desirous to be captivating and shine in
society, and so proud was Mr. Ashton of his beautiful
daughter, that he fell in readin with the expansive views of
the incipient belle ; and new steps or new melodies were
paraded for his gratiﬁcation week by week. But Mrs. Ashton,
telling her daughter that “knowledge was light of carriage,"
sent her to Mr. Mabbott’s to take lessons in cookery and con-
fectionery, and into the kitchen to put them in practice under
the eye of Kezia ; and, exercise being good for health, ac-
cording to the same sensible mother, she was required to
assist in bed-making, furniture polishing, dusting and general
household matters, for which the young lady had little liking,
and was not to be spurred into liking by any citation of her
cousin Ellen’s qualiﬁcations in these respects. She preferred
to dress with all the art at her command to make her beauty
more bewildering, and to take her place at harp or piano, or
embroidery frame, ready to receive visitors either with or with-
out her mother, and to be as fascinating as possible, especially _
when Laurence Aspinall was the caller; or she would sit in
de'shabillé in the retirement of her own chamber, and read
Moore and Byron because they were tabooed and the hand-
some lieutenant quoted them so enchantingly; whilst Cicily,
who had something to answer for in this respect, bustled about
and overworked herself to spare her darling Miss Augusta,
who, with all her faults, must have been a loving and lovable
creature to win such devotion from a dependent.
It happened that the young lady received visitors alone more
frequently than was desirable, Mrs. Ashton being unusually tied
to the warehouse through the interest Mr. Ashton took in the
establishment of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and
in the project for the widening of Market Street, and others of
the cramped thoroughfares 0f the growing town—which neces-
sarily took him much from home and his private business—to
say nothing of the excitement consequent on the trial of Queen
Caroline during its long progress.
But the year 1820, which had opened only to close the long
volume of George the Third’s life, and to open that of George
the Fourth’s reign at a chapter of regal wife persecution which
has few parallels, had itself grown old and died, and 1821 had
thrust itself prominently forward.
It came with awhite robe and a frost-bitten countenance,

which grew sharper and more pinched as weeks and months
went by. It looked down on the currents of rivers and canals,
on the secluded still waters of Strangeways Park, the oblong
pond in front of the Inﬁrmary, and the leech-shaped lakelet
within the area of Ardwick Green, until their ripples curdled
under their chilling glance of the New Year.
Sterner grew its aspect as the shivering weeks counted them-
selves into months, and the shrinking waters spread ﬁrst a thin
ﬁlm, then a thick and a thicker barrier of ice between them and
the freezing atmosphere. Every gutter had its slide, along
which clattering clogs -sped noiselessly ; every pool its vociferous
throng of boys, and every pond its mingled concourse of skaters
and sliders. Of these, the Inﬁrmary and Ardwick Green waters
were most patronised ,' the former having the more numerous
the latter having the more select body of skaters, and conse-
quently the more fashionable surrounding of spectators.
The amusements of the town were then on so limited and
exclusive a scale that long frost was quite a boon to the younger
portion of the community ; and during the sixteen weeks of its
continuance, the Green became a promenade gay with the
warm hues of feminine attire, as ladies ﬂocked to witness and
extol the feats of husbands, brothers, cousins or particular
friends. There was no fear of vulgar overcrowding (except on
Sundays) ; working-hours were long, and there were no Satur-
day half-holidays, so that only those whose time was at their
own disposal could share the sport or overlook it.
Amongst these, much to the annoyance of Mr. Aspinall, his
son Laurence chose to enrol himself, with less regard to the
ﬂuctuation of the cotton market, or the comparative value of
American or East India staples than the Cannon Street
merchant thought necessary to ﬁt him for his future partner or
successor. The younger man had chosen to construe liberally
the word “ gentleman,” which had been the be-all and end-all
of his training, and to regard elegant idleness as its synonym.
What availed his ﬁne ﬁgure and proﬁciency in arts and
athletics, if he had no opportunity for the display of his person
or his skill? And to throw away the rare chance the Winter
had provided was clearly to scorn the gift of the gods.
Accordingly he spent more time on Ardwick Green Pond-
than in the counting-house, varied occasionally with a visit to
the Assembly Billiard~room in Back Mosley Street, or a mom-
ing promenade in the Inﬁrmary Gardens, from the open gates
of which he generally contrived to emerge as Miss Ashton

descended the steps from Mr. Mabbott’s, and just in time to
A hand her courteously and daintily across the roadway, and
bear her company to her own door, discoursing of recent
assemblies or concerts, from the former of which she had
'hitherto been debarred, and of the last occasion on which he
had “ the exquisite pleasure of seeing her at Ardwick Green ”
——occasions which were seldom reported at home, any more
than the chance meetings on her way from Mr. Mabbott’s ; and
the reticence, be sure, boded no good.
Dr. Hull had long ago advised “out-door exercise” for the
rapidly-growing girl, and there was no embargo on her walks
abroad, Mrs. Ashton suspecting no danger, and no surrep-
titious meetings. Her visits to the Green during the long
skating season were quite as unrestrained, except that an escort
became a necessity. Occasionally her mother accompanied
her, sometimes Mrs. Walmsley and John (then there was gene-
rally a nurse and baby in the rear), sometimes Ellen and Mrs.
Chadwick ; and Augusta had always returned so exhilarated by
her country walk, and so delighted with all she had seen, that
once or twice, when imperative business withheld Mrs. Ashton
from bearing her daughter company, as promised, rather than
disappoint, the lady had made Mr. Clegg her deputy, an honour
on which he perhaps set far too high a value.
Mrs. Ashton would have drawn herself up with double
dignity, and repudiated as an insult the suggestion of any other
of their salesmen or clerks as an escort for her beautiful
daughter ; but Jabez lived in the house, had lived there so long,
had even from her childhood been the girl’s frequent guardian,
and proved himself so worthy of the trust, that she committed
her to his care now much as of old, and perhaps all the more
readily because she saw, or fancied she saw, a disinclination on
Miss Augusta’s part to be-so‘accompanied.
In March the cold was as intense as in January, and Miss
Ashton as eager to watch the skaters. One afternoon towards
the close of the month, when the breaking up of the frost was
anticipated, quite a family party had gone to the Green,
wrapped in fur-trimmed pelisses of velvet or woollen, with fur-
rimmed hats and Brobdignagian muffs.
It was not quite closing time when Mr. Ashton, always dis-
posed to be friendly with Jabez, accosted him.
“The ladies are gone to the Green, Clegg. Suppose you
lend me an arm along the slippery roads, and we go to meet
them, eh P ”

The sparkling eyes of Jabez conﬁrmed his ready tongue’s
“With pleasure, sir,” as, sensible of the honour done him,
he left the sale-room, whistled his black friend Nelson from
the yard, and they set off at a brisk pace, to keep the
blood in circulation, the dog leaping, bounding, and barking
before them, in token of good fellowship. As they passed
the Inﬁrmary pond, Jabez remarked that the ice began to
look watery, to which Mr. Ashton replied,
“Yes 3 I think Jack Frost’s long visit is near its end, and
there must be some truth in the old saw that ‘ a thaw is colder
than a frost.’ ”
At that moment Mr. Aspinall’s carriage rolled past them,
bearing the merchant homewards in distinguished state
(private carriages were by no means common), whereat Mr.
Ashton observed with a shrug,
“How pride punishes itself! Fancy a tall fellow like Mr.
Aspinall cramped up in a stiﬂing box upon wheels on a day
like this, when he has the free use of his limbs l”
Contrary to expectation, they did not come in sight of the
ladies until they gained the Green, which they found a scene of
wild hubbub and commotion; skaters and spectators gather-
ing towards the centre of the Green, whe'nce came a confused
noise of voices, shouting, crying, and screaming.
The quick eye of Jabez was at once arrested by the ﬁgure of
Augusta on the opposite bank, the centre of an appalled group,
wringing her hands in the very impotence of terror, and as he
penetrated the excited crowd, he saw the hatless head of a
man, whose body was submerged, resting with its chin upon a
ledge of the ice, which had apparently broken under him. At
the ﬁrst glance he failed to distinguish the head from the dis-
tance, and rushed forward, apprehensive lest it should be that
of either Mr. Walmsley or his friend Travis, whom he knew to
be of the party.
Recognition came accompanied by a shock that staggered
him. If the ice had attractions for Aspinall and Walmsley,
Ellen Chadwick had certainly as great attractions for Ben
Travis; but it is certain that neither cousins, nor mother, nor
aunt were sensible that they had been drawn thither simply as
asort of decorous train to Miss Augusta Ashton, whose in-
spiriting had in turn been the fascinating lieutenant, the most
graceful and accomplished skater on the pond. Perhaps she
hardly knew it herself, not being given to searching her own
heart for its motives. Buta hint from him had set her longing

for “ another sight of the skating before the chance was gone,”
and her imperative will no less than her persuasive voice had
swayed the rest.
Laurence had made the most of the occasion, glad of an
opportunity to cultivate the acquaintance of the whole family,
and display his graceful ﬁgure, and his skill to the best advantage.
Now and then he joined the Chadwicks and the Ashtons on
the bank, anon darted off, wheeling hither and thither, so swift
in his evolutions, the eye could scarcely follow him.
Amongst the skaters the man and his feats stood out. He
was the observed of all observers, and not vainer was he of his '
accomplishments than was Augusta at being singled out for at-
tention in the face of so many damsels of his acquaintance, all,
as she foolishly supposed, equally desirous to bask in the sun
of his smile.
A small match will kindle a large ﬂame if combustibles be
there. Fired by her too apparent satisfaction, and Mrs. Ashton’s
presence, his excessive vanity induced him to perform what,
with the imperfect skates of the period, was a distinguished
feat. He was ordinarily proud of his calligraphy. Now, he '
wound and twisted, lifted his skates or dashed them down, until
he had scored upon the ice an alphabet in bold capitals ; but
whether he had miscalculated his space, or the strength of the
ice—broken into for the use of cattle at the upper end—or the
crowd of inquisitive or envious followers had been too great for
its resistence, as he had made the last curl of the letter Z, the
ice gave way, and he was plunged in up to the neck, amid the
shrieks of women and the shouts of 'men. His chin had
caught upon the ice with a stunning blow ; but it rested there,
and, aided by the buoyancy of the water beneath, upheld him
until, with returning sense, he struggled to bring his shoulders
above the surface, and upheave himself. He trod the water,
and it sustained him, but the tee would not. He was forced to
content himself with the use of his hands beneath as paddles,
to relieve the pressure on his chin, and wait for help, which
seemed an eternity in coming.
He had been in the water some time when Jabez and Mr.
Ashton appeared on the scene, amongst women shrieking with
aﬁ'right, and men rushing about without presence of mind, or
paralysed to powerlessness. Mr. Travis alone seemed to have
a thought, and he had sent for ropes and hatchets to cut a way
to him through the ice itself. But there was a question, would
his strength hold out?

“Will no one save him r Will no one save him?” cn'ed
Augusta, piteously.
“ Fifty pounds to him who will save my son l” was the cry of
the frantic father, who had witnessed the accident from his own
carriage window. “ A hundred l—two hundred pounds !--ﬁve
hundred pounds to anyone who will save him !”
“It’s noan a bit 0’ use, measter," said a working man, with a
shake of his head. “ Men wunna chuck their lives aweay for
brass 3 an’ yon ice is loike a pane 0’ glass wi’ a stone through it.”
Unfortunately, impulsive Ben Travis had darted forward to
his rescue at the outset, and his ponderous weight had cracked
the already broken ice in all directions. He had himself re-
treated with diﬁiculty ; and now no offers of reward would
tempt men to put their own lives in peril, though Kit Townley
was there, urging others to the attempt, and Bob, the ex-groom,
had rushed for ropes they had neither pluck nor skill to use,
since a noosed cord, ﬂung like a lasso, would have strangled him.
“Oh ! save him 3 save him, Jabez l” implored Augusta, as he
and her father came up.
Jabez looked at her strangely. His head seemed to spin.
His face went livid as that on the ice. Had his secret devotion
no other end than this? True, she had called him “Jabez,”
but so she had called him in his servitude. She had appealed
to‘him as one she trusted in implicitly ; but the appeal sounded
as made for one she loved, and that was not himself, but he
who, as boy and man, had wounded him in soul and body.
The very tone of her cry was as a knell to his hopes and him-
self. It was his foe and his rival who was perishing! Was
he called upon to .risk his life to warm a serpent to sting him
again ? The conﬂict in his breast was sharp and terrible.
“ If thine enemy hunger, give him food,” seemed to ﬂoat in
his ears.
There was a small gloved hand on his arm, a pale, sweet
face looking up into his. The moments were ﬂying fast.
"Oh! Jabez, Jabez, do try l”
“ I will,” said he, hoarsely.
Had he not often declared in his secret heart that he would
give his life to serve her P—and should he be ungenerous
enough to shrink now?
7 “It is folly to attempt. I forbid it !” exclaimed Mrs. Ash~
ton, laying her hand on his arm. And Ellen Chadwick, pale
as Augusta, tried to stop him with—“ You must not ! you must
not ! You will perish ! ”

Even strangers from the crowd warned him back. But he
was gone ere Mrs. Chadwick softly recalled her daughter to-
herself. “ Hush ! Ellen. This is not seemly. Mr. Clegg will
attempt nothing impossible.”
He hurried to the side nearest Laurence; called to him,
“Keep up ,- help is coming I ”—asked for ladders ; gave a word
or two of instruction to Mr. Ashton and Travis ; sent Nelson
on the ice to try its strength; secured a rope round his own
waist ; then, lying ﬂat on the cold ice, cautiously felt his way to
the farther side of Aspinall, whose eyes were closed, and whose
strength was ebbing fast. He hardly heard the words of
cheer addressed to him.
Two long ladders had been lashed side by side to give
breadth of surface. These, by the help of cords and Nelson,
whose sagacity was akin to reason, he drew across the cracked
and gaping ice ; and crept slowly from rung to rung, watched
from the land breathlessly, until he reached his almost insen-
sible rival. With rapidly benumbing ﬁngers he secured strong
ropes beneath each shoulder, sending Nelson back to the bank
with the main line, in case his own strength was insufﬁcient to
lift the dead weight of Laurence, or that the ice should yield
beneath the double weight.
Someone sent a brandy-ﬂask back by the dog.
“Can you swallow? ” he asked. There was no answer, but
a gurgle.
He moistened the blue lips, while the head bent slightly
back, introduced a small quantity of the potent spirit between
his set teeth ; and, having warmed himself by the same means,
essayed to lift the freezing skater, who was almost powerless to
aid. But the latter with an extreme effort raised an arm above
the ice, and grasped recumbent Jabez. And now Nelson
proved his worth. He set his teeth in Aspinall’s high coat-
collar, and tugged until their united strength drew him upwards
and across the ladder sledge, almost as stiff and helpessas a
corpse.
To lessen the weight, Jabez crept from the ladders; they
were drawn to the side with their living freight before be him-
self was out of danger; for the heavy pressure and the swift
motion set the ice cracking under him, and with extreme difﬁ-
culty he dragged himself to the bank to sink down on the
hardened snow, overcome by the strain of mind and muscle,
whilst the approving crowd set up a shout, and Augusta Ashton
thanked him tremu-lously.

“I’m afraid, Clegg, you’ve spent your strength for a dead
man,” said Travis, grasping his hand warmly, “and Aspinall
was scarcely worth it, alive or dead.” '
But Jabez made no reply. ,H rose slowly and painfully,
shook off the congratulatory crow of strangers and friends, on
the plea of needing to “warm and dry himself,” refused point-
blank to accept the grateful hospitality of Mr. Aspinall, and
taking the proffered arm of Travis, turned towards the “ George
and Dragon,” as little like one who had done a noble action as
could be imagined. '
Mr. Ashton followed, tapping his gold snuff-box in wonder
and perplexity. He saw that something was wrong, but knew
not that Augusta’s hasty thanks had closed the young man’s
heart against all but its own pain.

CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH.
BLIND !
0 white, so cold, sostill was the rigid ﬁgure borne from
the pond to Mr. Aspinall’s house, Travis might well
count him “a dead man,” as the rumour ran concerning him ;
and feeble old Kitty set up a lamentation as over the dead.
Mrs. Ashton, who knew that to be a home Without a
thinking woman at its head, volunteered her services, and en-
tered the house with the bearers, leaving the trembling
Augusta with their friends. She gently put the old woman
aside, and felt pulse and heart.
“There is life,” said she, “and while there is life there is
> hope. Keep tears until there is time to shed them; now we
must act.” Then turning to the scared and scurrying ser-
vants, she gave her orders much as though she had been in
her own warehouse, and with a stately authority there was no
disputing.
The butler was bidden to “Bring brandy, quick!” The
footman was required to “wheel this sofa to the ﬁre, and
pile up the coals l” A maid was asked for “hot blankets
without delay!” and moaning Kitty was set to work to “help
to strip her young master and chafe his limbs.” And so
promptly Were her clear, cool orders obeyed, that when the
doctor arrived in hot haste with Mr. Aspinall, half his work
was done. The pulse had quickened and the limbs began to
glow, though the eyelids remained closed.
Most grateful then was Mr. Aspinall for the efﬁcient ma-
tronly service rendered to his motherless boy by the stately
lady, who was drawn nearer to him in his helplessness by her
own kindly act than by all the conciliatory visits and peace-
offerings with which Laurence had himself sought to propitiate
her. And for once Mr. Aspinall accepted a kindness as a
favour, not as a tribute to his personal importance, and he

placed his carriage at the disposal of Mr. Ashton and herself
for their return home, without a sign of his usual self-inﬂation.
His importance received a considerable shock, however,
when he called at the house in Mosley Street the following
day to report progress, and relieve himself of his obligation to
his son’s preserver by paying over the ﬁve hundred pounds’ he
had in his extremity offered as a reward.
“I do not think ' Mr. Clegg will accept a reward,” said Mr.
and Mrs. Ashton in a breath.
“Not accept it!” and the portly ﬁgure seemed to swell 5
a “ﬁve hundred pounds is a large sum for a young man in his
position 3 only a fool or a madman would refuse it.”
“Just so, just so,” replied Mr. Ashton, offering his open
snuff-box to his visitor, whilst Mrs. Ashton stirred the ﬁre as
asort of dubious disclaimer; “but I think, for all that, you
will ﬁnd we are right; Mr. Clegg is not a common man, and
is not actuated by common motives—My dear P” He nod-
ded, and Mrs. Ashton pulled the bell-rope.
Mulberry-suited James answered on the instant.
“Mr. Clegg is wanted.”
Mr. Clegg, labouring under the disadvantage of a cold'
caught the previous afternoon, to which any huskiness of voice
might be attributed, obeyed the summons. He was presented
duly to Mr. Aspinall, and much to that gentleman’s surprise,
was invited to take a seat.
“Asolutely invited to take a seat!” as he afterwards re-
_counted in indignation to a friend ,- “these Whigs have no
respect for a gentleman’s feelings.”
Nor had Jabez. He was pale enough when he entered, but
his face ﬂushed, his lips compressed, and the scar on his brow
showed vividly, as Mr. Aspinall drew forth a roll of crisp
bank-notes from his pocket-book, and loftily offered to him the
reward he had “ earned by his bravery.”
He ﬂushed, put back the notes with a movement of his
hand, and said, coldly: “You owe me nothing, sir. The
meanest creature on God’s earth should have freely such service
as I rendered to your son. I cannot set a price on life.”
“ But I offered the reward, and the fact is, I must discharge
the debt. Reconsider, young man, it is a large sum: many a
man starts the world with less.”
“ A large sum to pay for your son’s life, or for mine, sir?”
' interrogated Jabez, drawing himself up stifﬂy ; adding, without
waiting for reply, “I do not sell such service, sir. You owe

me'nothing. Let your son thank Miss Ashton for his life ; he
is her debtor, not mine.”
The words seemed to rasp over a nutmeg-grater, they
came so hoarsely, as did his request for leave to withdraw;
and he closed the door on the ﬁve hundred pounds, and on
the smiles of husband and wife, before the rebuffed cotton
merchant could master his indignation to reply.
The notes in his palm were light enough, but lying there
they represented liberality contemned ; a debt unpaid; an un-
discharged obligation to an inferior ; and not thrice their value
in gold could have pressed so heavily on Mr. Aspinall as that
last consideration. The frigid manner of Jabez he construed
into Radical impudence; he resented the salesman’s repudia-
tion of reward as a personal affront, and did not scruple to
express his views openly, then and there, winding up with a
question which startled his interlocutors.
“What did the singular young man mean by' his reference to
Miss Ashton P”
Had they followed the “ singular young man” across the
hall to the sanctuary of his own sitting-room, seen him dash
himself down into a chair, and bury his head in his hands on
the table with unutterable anguish on his face, and heard burst
from his lips—more as a groan than embodied thought—-
“ Oh, Augusta, adored Augusta, what a presumptuous madman
I have been !”—they would but have had half the answer.
But had they mounted the polished oaken stairs to the dainty
chamber where Augusta Ashton lay in bed with a “ cruel head-
ache,” brought on by the fright, and eyes red with weeping at
the catastrophe which had befallen her adorable admirer, the
gallant lieutenant, and heard her half-audible lamentations, the
answer might have been complete.
Mrs. Ashton had heard Augusta’s frantic appeal to Jabez at
at the pond, had seen him stagger and turn livid as if shot,
noted the inward struggle ere he said, “ I will ;” but she had
ascribed it to old and unforgiven injuries, and thinking it hard
that he should be called upon to haaard his life for his known
enemy with chances so heavy against him, had herself forbidden
the attempt. This was all the solution she had to offer Mr.
Aspinall. In the excitement of the accident and the rescue,
she had overlooked Augusta’s excessive emotion, but now her
mother’s heart took alarm. Could it be that the younger eyes
of Jabez had seen a preference for the handsome scapegrace
which she had not? w

The matter was talked over by husband and wife long after
Mr. Aspinall had left ,' and the anxious mother questioned the
maiden in the privacy of her own room, to come thence with
the sad conviction that Augusta had prematurely been led
captive by a handsome face and a dashing air, irrespective of
worth or worthlessness, Yet she consoled herself and Mr.
Ashton with the reﬂection. “ It is, after all, only a girlish fancy,
and will die out.” /
“Just so, and as the young rake is laid by the leg for one
while, there is all the more chance,” assented Mr. Ashton.
“ If his immersion does not convert him into a hero,” added
the matron, with a clearer knowledge of her daughter. Yet
neither asked themselves how the intuitive perception of Jabez
came to be more acute than their own, nor what power im-
pelled him to risk his life for an enemy at the mere bidding of
Augusta. Indeed, they set the hazardous exploit down to the
score of magnanimity and bravery only.
Equally unobservant were they of Ellen Chadwick’s remon-
strance, or her feverish watch of every perilous turn Jabez and
Nelson had taken on the ice, or of the caresses she lavished on
the dog when all was over. Only Mrs. Chadwick had seen
that, as she had seen fainter signs years before ,' but she held
her peace, and, having a leaven of her sister’s pride, “hoped
she was mistaken.”
There were three young hearts consumed by the same
passion—that which lies at the root of the happiness or misery
of the world,—-one nursing the romance, two ﬁghting against
its hopelessness in silence and concealment; but “the race is
not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.”
Jabez Clegg could not tell when he had not loved Augusta
Ashton, from the time when she was young enough to play
about the ware-rooms, or to be lifted across the muddy road-
ways in his strong apprentice arms, when it was his pleasant
duty to protect her to and from school. But he could trace
back the time when Hogarth’s prints gave to that love a deﬁ-
nite shape, and he began to look upon his master’s daughter as
a prize to be attained. All things had tended to conﬁrm his
belief in its possibility, and love and ambition had gone hand
in hand, and fed each other. The child had come to him for
companionship and entertainment, the girl under his protection
had conﬁded to him her school-day troubles, and come to him
for help in difﬁculties, with lessons on slate or book. She had
looked up to him, trusted him, clung to him ; and though she

was as a star in his ﬁrmament, he hadvhad a sort of vague
impression that the star which shone upon him from afar
would draw nearer, and, as he rose to it, come down to meet
him.
His ﬁrst sharp awakening was her reminder that the pair of
intoxicated ofﬁcers who had insulted her in the theatre were
“ gentlemen,” and so not to be chastised by him. His second
—and then jealousy added a sting—was meeting Aspinall face
to face in the ball, when the latter smilingly bowed himself out
~ on his ﬁrst visit. And now he brooded in despair over the ﬁnal
dissipation of his dream beneath the icicle-hung boughs on
Ardwick Green ; for the ﬁrst time conscious that she belonged
to another sphere.
Never by look or word had he done himself, or her, or her
parents, the dishonour of giving expression to his ambitious
love ; and now another had looked on his divinity, and won her
for himself. It came upon him like a ﬂash when that white—
faced agony, that piteous cry, called him to imperil his own life
—worthless in the scale against another, and that other. It
came upon him with a ﬂash that scathed like lightning. He
had forgiven the boy Aspinall long ago; and the man~well,
Augusta’s happiness demanded the sacriﬁce, and he had made
it. Out of his very love for Augusta he had saved the rival’s
life she had prayed for. And he had been offered money for
the act which wrecked his own life. Thank God he had re
jected it with scorn !
A kind hand laid on his shoulder interrupted a reverie which
had induced torpor. ,
“Mr. Clegg, you are ill—your cold requires attention. You
had better seek repose : you are quite feverish.”
Repose! The man’s soul was on ﬁre, as well as his body. '
Yet from his chamber a fortnight later emerged a grave business
man, without an apparent thought beyond the warehouse.
And what of Laurence Aspinall, whom we left with closed
eyes, wrapped in blankets, on a sofa P He had hung suspended
in the water for an hour by the clock in the tower of St.
Thomas’ ivy-clad church ; and notwithstanding he had kept his
limbs and the water in motion so long as he had power, the
chill had extended upwards, and though life had been called
back, sight and reason were in abeyance.
Shorn of his rich curls, for weeks he raved and struggled in
the grasp of brain fever ; and old Kitty, forgetting everything
but her promise to his dead mother, watched and 'tended him

night and clay, albeit nurses from the Fever-Ward relieved each
other in their well-paid care of him.
The frost was gone; vegetation, bound so long, had leapt
upwards from its chains. Lilacs and May-buds greeted him
with perfume through the open windows, and even the daffodil
and narcissus sent up their incense from the brim of the
' garden-pond when he began to show signs of amendment,
“ Better,” “ Much better,” were the answers to inquirers
(among whom may be cited Kit Townley, and Bob, their some-
time groom ; but the lilac and the hawthorn ripened and faded,
and the daffodils gave place to the wallﬂower and carnation,
and the rosebuds opened their ripe lips to June, yet the rich
cotton merchant’s son saw nothing of the glow.
Over the blue eyes of Laurence the lids were closed, and not
an oculist in the town had skill to open them. Dr. Hull, the
consulting physician of the Eye Institution, and his surgical
colleagues, Messrs. Wilson and Travers, had laid their heads
together over a case peculiar in all its bearings, but the lids re-
mained obstinater shut.
At length, when Hope had folded her drooping wings in
despair, and Mr. Aspinall was borne down with grief for his
sightless son, someone suggested that, as water had done the
mischief, water in action might cure it. »
“ Can he swim? ” asked rough Dr. Hull curtly of Kitty.
“ Swim? ay, he can do owt he shouldna do,” replied the old
woman, having no faith in the value of her charge’s peculiar
accomplishments.
“ Is he a good swimmer? ”
“ Awreckon so! He usent to swim fur wagers i’ Ardy (Ard-
wick) Green Pond when he wur quoite a little chap.”
»“ That will do.”
Mr. Aspinall was conferred with, and the next day’s mail
coach took the blind patient, his father, Kitty, and one of the
surgeons to Liverpool. After a night’s rest at the York Hotel,
they were driven down to St. George’s Pier, a very humble pre-
sentment of what it is in this 'our day. Like Manchester,
Liverpool has vastly swelled in size and importance within the
last ﬁfty years, and her docks have grOWn with the shipping
needing shelter. The Mersey was not the crowded highway it
is now—there were fewer ships and no steamers to cross each
other’s track, and set the waters in commotion, defying wind
and tide.
Mr. Aspinall had engaged a boat to be in readiness. The

sightless athlete was rowed a short distance from curious spec-
tators on the pier, and then, his face being turned towards
Birkenhead, he plunged into the swelling river, which he
breasted like a Triton, so welcome and native seemed the
element to him. 'And as the salt wave buoyed him up, or
‘dashed over his cropped head, he appeared to gain fresh
strength with every stroke.
Anxiously his three attendants followed in his wake, lest
cramp should seize him, or his impaired strength give out be-
fore the river—there rather more than a mile in breadth—
could be crossed. Yet not a yard of the distance bated he.
By instruction he had bent his course slightly down stream,
so as to meet the opposing tide, then rolling in with a freshet.
He struck out boldly, the very dash of the salt waves invigorat-
ing him as they broke over his bare poll, or laved his naked
limbs. Still well in advance of the boat, he seemed at last to
cross the current as a conqueror. He' touched the shore at
Rockferry, and—miracle of miracles l—his eyes were opened.
Laurence Aspinall, who for weeks had cursed his darkened
existence, could once more see 1

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST.*
CORONATION-DAY.
ISFORTUNE binds closer than prosperity. The
calamity Which tied Laurence Aspinall down in a
strait-waistcoat to a bed of fever, with shaven head and
sightless eyes, touched the Ashtons in a tender point. Them~
selves the parents of an only child, the very crown and glory
of their lives, their sympathies went forth to Mr. Aspinall, in
spite of his haughty assumption. Indeed, distress brought
him down to the common level of humanity; and having
neither sister, aunt, nor cousin to undertake the care of his sick
son for love, and not for fee, he learned the comparative power-
lessness of wealth, and hailed with all the gratitude in his
nature the occasional visits of Mrs. Ashton, in whose stately
bearing, no doubt, he recognised a sort of kinship.
It was, however, not Mrs. Ashton the business woman, not
Mrs. Ashton the lofty lady, but Mrs. Ashton the mother who
laid her cool hand on the young man’s fevered forehead, ques-
tioned the nurses, made suggestions for the beneﬁt of the
invalid, and by means of a “ Ladies’ Free Registry ” in Chapel
Walk, found a staid woman of experience to act as house-
keeper, and bring the disorganised household into order with-
out treading on the toes of attached but incapable Kitty.
The head of Antinous shorn of its glorious locks, swathed
in lotion-cloths, tossing in delirium, would scarcely appear so
attractive as to ﬁll the most timid mother with fears for a
romantic daughter’s heart, and so whilst sympathy was awake
vigilance slumbered. Yet never need vigilance have been
more awake. She saw him as he was—Augusta, as he had
been. Through other channels than the maternal she heard of
his condition from day to day, and how in his delirium he had
mixed up her name with the slang of the cock-pit, the race~

course, and the prize-ring; but with strange infatuation she
ignored all that should have warned, and clung to all that was
pleasant to her own self-love. Never had she been so
assiduous in her visits to her aunt Chadwick and her cousin
Walmsley ; and her smiling “ I’ve brought my work and come
to sit with you this afternoon,” should have been translated,
“I hope John or Mr. Travis will drop in. They are sure to
have something to say about Mr. Laurence; it is so dreadful
‘ not to know how he is going on.”
And pretty generally her calculations were correct ; the two
gentlemen were interested in Aspinall as a member of their
yeomanry corps, apart from private friendship, and were con-
stant in their inquiries, even ﬁnding their way to “his bed-side ;
and Mr. Benjamin Travis, who could not very well every day
manage to meet Mr. Chadwick accidentally on his way from
the warehouse, and lend his stout arm as a support, appeared
only too glad to be the bearer of bulletins from Ardwick, as
an excuse for calling in Oldham Street and hovering about
the chair or the window where Ellen Chadwick sat at her sew-
ing or knitting, and grew silent on his entrance, blushing when
she heard his footstep or his voice in the hall, from motives
sadly misinterpreted.
There was no mistaking the true purport of his frequent
visits and assiduous attention to the crippled old gentleman;
so Augusta having settled in her own mind that Ellen
was either too reserved or too shy to give her big, good-
natured but timid lover proper encouragement, took upon
herself to play into his hands and make opportunities for his
woomg.
“What a delightful afternoon for a walk 1 ” Whether he or
she made the observation, the other was sure to assent; and
then wilful Miss Augusta, unaccustomed to be gainsaid, and
seconded by her aunt, also a secret ally of Ben Travis, would
drag her cousin forth in deﬁance of any excuse or protestation,
t0 the undisguised satisfaction of their magniﬁcent cavalier.
It was remarkable that on these occasions, whether they took
their way up Ancoats, or Dale Street, or Piccadilly, or Garret
Road, they would eventually be led so near to Ardwick Green
that it would have been unkind had not Mr. Travis “just
stepped across to see how Mr. Laurence progressed.”
And so, too, whenever she went abroad with Cicily at her
heels, or when Cicily was sent on errand, nothing would content
her imperative young mistress but that she should hasten

The Manchester Man. 219
(whether in her way or out of it), with “Mrs. Ashton’s com_
pliments,” to ascertain the condition of the invalid scapegrace.
Many a scolding did breathless Cicily get in consequence-
from angry Kezia, the queen iof the kitchen,which Augusta
paid her messenger for with coins, or ribbons, or kerchiefs, or
smooth words, as might be most convenient at the time. And
Mrs. Ashton was accredited by the Aspinalls with a degree of
attention never contemplated by herself. ,
But there was one person in the house Augusta avoided
from that afternoon at the end of March, when her fascinating
hero would have lost his life but for a much humbler hero, of
less pretension and fewer attractions. She might have been
blind as father and mother to his attachment until that after-
noon ; but that one wild, impassioned, agonised look of Jabez
into her eyes had opened them for ever, she felt she had
tasked him beyond human endurance, and was ashamed to
look him in the faCe.
The presumption of the ex‘apprentice paled before his
devotion and self-abnegation, but, self-conscious, after that ﬁrst
outburst of thanks on the Green, she had shrunk from meeting
him in hall or staircase, and had always a reason ready why
he should not be invited to their own tea-table when father or
mother proposed it. _
Public events march on irrespective of private joys or
sorrows, and no individual goes out into the world after three
months’ seclusion to ﬁnd things just as he left them. The ﬁrst
use Laurence Aspinall made of his eyes was to look at himself
in a mirror; the second on his return to Manchester, to select a
substitute for the clustering curls of which he had been de-
spoiled. Closely shut in the carriage which Mr. Ashton lightly
designated a box, he was driven down Market Street, to dis-
cover that the Spirit of Improvement, “fell bane of all that’s
picturesque,” had touched the ancient, many-gabled, black-and
white houses with which his earliest recollections were as-
sociated, and they were crumbling into dusty ruins before the .
potent incantation “ Space.” It was the beginning of a very
necessary widening of the main thoroughfares of the growing
commercial metropolis; but the blanks in the narrow street
took Laurence by surprise.
There was a newspaper the more for his restored sight to
scan, albeit the Manrhesfer Guardian, which Jeremiah Garnett
and John Edward Taylor ﬁrst gave to the world on the ﬁfth
of May, was scarcely likely to take his view of party politics,

or of his share in the Peterloo massacre, which was still a
disturbing element in the town. Just now the paper, which
he found at the perruquier’s, was given over to the discussion
of the approaching coronation of George IV., which likewise
formed the theme of conversation, not only at the wig-maker’s,
but whithersoever he turned when once more presentable.
Somehow, though he found his way to the warehouse, and
the cockpit, and the Assembly Billiard Club, and to Tib Street,
where Bob the groom had a pretty daughter very much at the
young man’s disposal, he did not present himself at his Mosley
Street friend’s as soon as might have been expected, consider-
ing all things ; and Augusta, in the most becoming of morning
robes, watching with eager expectation for his coming, began
to pant and chill with the sickness of hope deferred. He was
by no means the only admirer of the lovely heiress, and was
sufﬁciently desirous to complete his conquest before other
competitors were fairly in the ﬁeld; but he was in perplexity
how to deal with Jabez Clegg, who stood in his way after another
sort. He was grateful—after a fashion—for the preservation
of his life ; but ungrateful, inasmuch as Jabez was the preserver.
“Hang it!” said he, in conference with himself, as be tied
on a neck-cloth at the glass, “if the fellow had but taken the
ﬁve hundred pounds, there’d have been an end of it; and one
could have wiped one’s hands of him. What right had the
beggarly charity-boy to refuse a reward, as if he were a gentle-
man, I should like to know? I wonder what Kit Townley and
Walmsley were about—the cowardly ninnies—to let an upstart
like that pull me out of the hole. I’d almost as lief have been
drowned.”
And away went a spoiled cravat across the room in his tem-
per ; and he rummaged for a fresh one, to the detriment of
linen, as he went on—
“There’s one thing, I must either bring down my pride or
give up the girl, and be d d to it 1 That old Ashton, with
his ‘ Just so !’ like a cuckoo, would certainly shut the door in
my face if I neglected to make a set speech, and thank his pre-
cious protege, who knocks you down with one hand and picks
you up with the other. Well, I don’t feel inclined to surrender
the ﬁnest girl in Lanmshire, and with such a fortune as she’ll
have, so I’m, in for it. I must make a virtue of necessity.
Egad! I’ll write to this Mr. Clegg. No, I won’t. It would
be a feather in his cap to have a thanksgiving letter of mine to
exhibit.”

'T he Manchester Man. 221
Having at length determined his course, Mr. Laurence be-
took himself to Mosley Street, made his bow duly and grace-
fully to Mrs. Ashton and the young lady, keeping the hand of
the latter as long within his own as etiquette would permit,
and sending the warm blood mantling to her cheek, with a
supplicating glance of devotion as potent as words. Then,
with some little prolixity,, he professed his desire to “thank
his noble preserver ” for the life he had saved ; and at his re-
quest Mr. Clegg (whom he might just as well have thanked in
the warehouse without ceremony) was sent for. Coming into
the parlour all unwittingly as he did, to ﬁnd Laurence Aspinall,
handsome as ever, and more interesting from illness, standing
under the lacquered-serpent chandelier in close proximity to
Augusta, sparkling with animation, and blushing like the rose
he had just offered her with a pretty simile, his emotions so
overmastered him that the polished gentleman had him at a
disadvantage, and shone in comparison. '
Both Augusta and her mother noted the contrast between
the elegant manner, suave tones, and rounded periods of Lau-
rence Aspinall’s thanks and the curt disclaimer of Jabez,
though their deductions were different. Augusta was in raptures
with the rose-giver.
“Ah ! my dear, all is not gold that glitters. There is more
sterling metal in your father’s salesman, mark my words, than
in the tinselled lieutenant,” was the summing-up of the elder,
as she replaced cake and wine in side-board and cellaret. She
was clearly no friegl to Aspinall now that he had recovered
sense and sight.
The town, which had been strong and outspoken in its con-
demnation of the new king during the trial of Queen Caroline,
was now all alive with preparations to celebrate his coronation
with beﬁtting magniﬁcence, one branch of trade vying with
another which should make the greatest display in the coming
procession to the Green, the like of which never had been,
and never would be again. And this competition, productive
of marvellous results, due, in a great measure, to trade rivalry
and an ambitious desire to outshine, was set down by historians,
rightly or wrongly, as a proof of the excessive loyalty of the
Mancestrians.
In all classes, from the highest to the lowest, something was
being done, and nothing was talked of, thought of, dreamed
of, but the coronation and the procession. In courts, and
alleys there were making, and mending, and washing, and no

little pinching was undergone by hard-working fathers and
mothers to provide the girls with white cambric frocks, tippets,
and net caps, or the lads with fresh jackets and breeches and
shoes, so as not to disgrace the Sunday-schools under whose
banners they were to walk.
The ﬁnest horses of the Old Quay Company and Pickford’s
were put into new harness and the ﬁnest condition, and every
lurry (a long, ﬂat, sideless waggon) was called into requistion. '
Smiths, saddlers, sign and scene painters, were at work day and
night for weeks ,' and such was the request for banners that ladies
undertook the work when skilled labour was not to be found.
The important ceremony was ﬁxed for the 19th of July.
On the 17th a deputation of small-ware weavers waited on\Mr.
Ashton in despair. They could get neither ‘ﬂag nor banner;
the painter had thrown over the order at the last moment.
“ An’ Tummy Worthington’s getten a foine un, measter.
It’ll be a sheame an’ a disgrace to us 0’ if we let Worthington’s _
cut us eawt.”
[The said Worthington was a rival small-ware manufacturer .
Mr. Ashton had recourse to his snuff-box, and then to 1115
wife.
“ My dear, what is to be done? There will be no ﬂag. The
painters cannot execute the jobs in hand. Worthington’s have
a ﬁne one I hear.”
“ N 0 ﬂag I That will never do. We must have a flag. Let
me consider.”
Ellen Chadwick was busy helping Augusta to make favours
for the men. She looked up.
“ Do you not think Mr. Clegg could paint you one? ” she
suggested.
Mr. Ashton brightened, but his “Just so !3’ was nipped in
the bud by the recollection that there was no time.
“ Where there’s a will there’s a way,” said Mrs. Ashton, and
sought out Jabez.
“ It is quite out of my line, but I can try. It would be a
pity to disappoint the men,” answered he.
“ And nothing beats trying but doing 1” added Mrs.
Ashton.
Silk and colours were procured. There was no-leisure for
complex design or elaboration. At that time the dark blue
covers of the Dutch tapes in gross bore the symbolic device of
the ﬂax plant within a rude scroll. This Jabez transferred in
colours to his silk on a colossal scale, both sides bearing the

same emblem of their trade, more effective on its completion
than any elaborate work. He had bargained to be left without
interruption. The men ﬁdgeted about the warehouse in a state
of nervous trepidation (it was an important matter to them),
but at dawn on the r9th it was ﬁnished, and borne off by the
weavers in triumph and exultation.
Market Street Lane being in ruins at one end, and a narrow
gully at the other, Mosley Street became the natural course for
the procession (two miles and a half in length) from Peter’s
Field to the Green, where a royal salute was to be ﬁred 3 and
like every other house on the line of route, Mr. Ashton’s was
ﬁlled with guests, and from garret to basement every window
had its streamer, and was crowded with gaily-dressed spectators,
mostly feminine, the gentlemen of the town taking part in the
procession, ofﬁcially or otherwise. The Chadwicks and Mrs.
Walmsley were there of course, and Mrs. Clough amongst
others ; and on another floor Jabez—who being above the
warehousemen, and not a master, did not walk—had as a com-
panion good Bess Hulme, who with her husband had come
over from Whaley-Bridge, where there was, of course, a holiday.
To Tom had been assigned the honour of chief standard-
bearer.
In all such processions the military element, with its brilliant
uniforms and stirring music prevails. But here (where every
item of the cavalcade had its own brass band) were also all the
dignitaries of the church, with every silver badge of oﬂice
resplendently burnished for the occasion; the borough-reeve,
and other magistrates, and constabulary, in new uniforms ; the
lamplighters with new smocks, carrying their ladders and cans ;
the ﬁremen and ﬁre-engines, bright as paint and polish could
make them; the gentlemen of the town, all with favours ; the
Sunday-school children, marshalled under their respective
banners or tablets, walking six abreast; the Ladies’ Jubilee
School; the Green-Coat School; and the Blue-Coat School,
on which Jabez looked down with curiously-mingled feelings.
But the marked feature of the magniﬁcent procession was
the display made by the trades, with their banners, a lurry ac-
companying each, bearing well-dressed workmen and machines
in full operation.
At the head of these came two ﬁgures, representing Adam
and Eve, in a perfect bower of greenery, as representatives of
the primitive condition before dress was invented. They were
followed by a lurry, on which tailors (whose art is the ﬁrst on

record) sat cross-legged, and stitched and pressed, asif on a
shopboard, whilst a select band of journeymen walked after,
bearing minature garments on wands, or ferruginous geese and
sleeveboards.
The blacksmiths wrought on their anvil, and carried also on
long poles, horse-shoes, tire. The brass and copper smiths,
likewise at work, had a bright array of kettles, candlesticks, and
a mounted man in armour, as had also the tin-plate workers.
The glass-blowers made a goodly array, and gave away tokens
as they went. The men wore hats and caps brittle and brilliant,
with wavy plumes of spun glass, whilst birds, ships, goblets,
and decanters on their poles glistened in the beams of the hot
sun. A printing-press distributed appropriate verses, worked
OH in the course of the pr0cession. And St. Crispin’s followers
waxed their threads and plied their awls on boots and shoes as
they and their benches were borne along, followed by their
leather-aproned fraternity, holding aloft their productions, from
the most gigantic of Wellingtons to the tiniest infant’s slipper.
All branches of the cotton trade were represented. There
was cotton in bags; twist in bales; carding, roving, spinning,
weaving, all going on under the eyes of the onlookers, with the
workpeople following in their best and brightest.
Shouts and hurrahs attended the whole line of march, not
wholly unaccompanied by hisses ; but as the small-ware weavers
passed Mr. Ashton’s the cheers were deafening. A loom was
at work weaving lengths of binding for garters, on which was
inwoven “ God save King George IV.,” with the date, and these
were lifted on long wands to'the ladies at the windows on their
way, or scattered to others in the street ; and as Tom Hulme
caught the eye of Jabez, he pointed proudly to their banner,
which had no rival in all the elaborately painted ﬂags waving
in the wind, and the impromptu artist was well satisﬁed. But
the brightest day has its cloud. As the Manchester Yeomanry
went prancing past, Travis and Walmsley alike saluted the
ladies at-the drawing-room window, but to the pain of Jabez
and the indignation of Mrs. Ashton, Lieutenant Aspinall had
the audacity to kiss his hand to Augusta.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND.
EVENING: IMDOORS AND our!
HE two-miles-and-a-half-long procession was not the only
popular demonstration which made the Coronation of
George IV. memorable in the annals of Manchester. There
were no telegraph wires to ﬂash intelligence to the supporters
of Queen Caroline that she had been repulsed from the Abbey
gates, and driven thence to die broken-hearted and uncrowned. >
So, in the absence of a cause for indignation, loyalty, or its sub-
‘stitute, contrived to add a pendant of disorder and excess only
to be recorded as the dung-heap out of which grew flowers of
promise.
As in most of the private houses along the line of route, a
cold collation had been prepared for the refreshment of the
friends who crowded Mr. Ashton’s open windows. But no
calculation had been made of the space the unwonted pageant
would cover, or the time it would occupy in passing 3 and Mrs.
Ashton, having discovered that sight-seeing in the dust and
glare of July was parching and fatiguing, issued orders for tea
to be handed round when the last banner had disappeared,
and before her less intimate friends should rise to depart.
In giving these orders, she unwittingly stirred the kitchen
ﬁre into a white heat. Lavish hospitality was a characteristic
of the time, and when a family of good position professed to
keep “ open house,” it was generally equal to the most extrava-
gant demands. But, as a rule, Mrs. Ashton had little leaning
towards impromptu parties, and Kezia considerably less, pre-
ferring those grand and formal receptions which involved
elaborate preparation, and placed imaginary feathers in the
caps of mistress and maids.
Kezia herself considered the honour of the house involved
in everything under her control being “in apple-pie order 5”
ipmd the surprise which put her on her mettle, put her also in a
ume.

Recalled from the window—-whence her head had been
poked far as the farthest—to provide tea and its concomitants
for an indeﬁnite number of strangers, she accompanied her
erratic movements about her domain with explosive outbursts
of spleen at “bein’ takken unawares when nowt’s ready to
hand.”
“Here’s missus bin an’ ordered tay fur th’ whole boilin’ of
folk up-stairs ; an’ theer’s Cicily and t’other wenches a’ agog
ower th’ crownation, an’ not worth ’toss of a pancake 1”
She jerked out her anger in the ears" of Bess Hulme, who,
seated on the settle, had just lulled to sleep Mrs. Walmsley’s
crying baby, which (neglected by its gaping nurse) had com-
memorated the day by a fall from a high bed.
Bess made a temporary couch for the baby in a snug corner,
and quietly came to Kezia’s assistance ; then Ellen Chadwick,
intuitively perceptive of kitchen troubles, busied herself in
bringing reserves of china, glass, plate, linen, and sweetmeats
from closets and store-room ; Cicily and Dolly came down in
due time; and the credit of the establishment lost nothing in
Kezia’s hands, even though there was an additional inﬂux of
visitors, and a supper also to provide.
That was Mr. Ashton’s affair. He had tired of his proces-
sional march in the broiling sun by the time they had skirted
Ardwick, and deﬁled into Chancery Lane. The two friends
by his side, Mr. John McConnell and Mr. John Green (both
cotton-spinners with whom he dealt), being of the same mind,
they had fallen out of the line in Ancoat’s Lane, and turned
down Canal Street to the house of the latter, to refresh them-
selves with something less dry than snuff or road-dust.
Mr. Green was the uncle of Henry Liverseege, the artist,
fragile of form and spiritual of face, but the latter was then
onlya genius in his nineteenth year—with fame and an early
grave dimly foreshadowed. They found him on the doorstep,
withhis fussy and ﬁdgety, though kind-hearted aunt, just back
from Mr. Gore’s in Piccadilly, whence they had seen the show.
The gentlemen’s requirement, a “draught of ale,” was soon
supplied, accompanied by a spasmodic comment on the “ grand
display,” and the exhibition of a pair of the loyally inscribed
ﬁlletsv she had secured as the smallware-weavers passed.
“ By-the-bye, that was" a wonderfully effective banner of
yours, Mr. Ashton,” interposed the thin voice of Liverseege.
“ Who painted it P ”
“A young fellow in my employ, who occasionally designs

for us,” answered Mr. Ashton, handing his snuff-box to the
group in rotation—“ quite a self-taught artist!”
“Indeed! It was not much like an amateur’s brush. I
should like to know him. You see I do something in that
way myself.” The young painter, conscious of his own latent
power, was sensitively alive to undeveloped art in another.
“Would you? Just so! Then you shall. Come along,
all of you, and ﬁnish the day with us. Mrs. Ashton will ﬁnd '
us a dish of tea, and I am sure, Mrs. Green, she will be proud, ‘
to see you also.” Turning to the gentlemen, who had by this
time emptied their talboy glasses, he added, “And I think I
have a few bottles of rare old port waiting among the cobwebs
for us to drink the King’s health.”
It was a period of much pressing and many excuses, but the
excitement of the day had so far destroyed ceremony that
even Mrs. Green, who was somewhat punctillious, after a little '
nervous trepidation‘anent the ﬁtness of her last new cap for
company, consented, and accepted the arm Mr. Ashton gal-
lantly offered to pilot her across the crowded street, along which
the tail of the procession had only just trailed.
Graciously, though with her natural stateliness, Mrs. Ashton
received the new-comers ; Mrs. Green, ﬁnding the company
generally in morning visiting dress, was at ease about her cap ;
the tea was exhilarating; the viands toothsome ; the wines
excellent ; there was one common topic for discussion ,- the ice 7
of ceremony had thawed hours before ; and genial Mr. Ashton,
having locked the doors to prevent the escape of a guest
before the supper he had bespoken was demolished, was
thoroughly in his element.
Mrs. Ashton was not quite so much at ease, though she was
too well-bred to manifest her disquiet, which had two sources.
In the ﬁrst place, the presumptious salutation of Augusta by
Lieutenant Aspinall h'ad jarred a sensitive nerve. In the
second, Mr. Ashton, generously impulsive, had introduced Mr.
Clegg to their friends, and as a friend of whom he was himself
proud. She thoroughly appreciated Jabez, and equally con-
templated his advancement ; but she was for “ making no more
'haste than good speed,” and considered it more prudent to
raise him by insensible degrees. And as she watched her
husband, radiant with good-will, cross the room with Jabez
(discomposed at the very doorway by the wondering eyes of
Augusta), and present him to Mr. Green and Mr. Liverseege,
thus ran her thoughts :—
Q 2

228 T he Manckester Man.
“ Dear me! William is very inconsiderate! He will turn
the young man’s head, and insult our visitors at the same
time. I hope Mrs. Clough will not recognise him. How in-
dignant she would be if she thought we expected her to
associate with one who once wore her son’s cast-oﬁ' clothes!
Certainly he is well-conducted, and worthy in all respects, but
-—-pe0ple don’t forget such things! If Mr. Green and Mr.
McConnell only knew William was introducing our Blue-coat
apprentice, what would they say P—I am glad, however, to see
young Mr. Liverseege so affable with Jabez.”
To her surprise, at this juncture, Mr. McConnell drew his
chair close to Jabez and Mr. Liverseege, and attributing the
evident embarassment of the former to the newness of his
position, endeavoured to dissipate it by taking part in the con-
versation, to which quiet Mr. Green occasibnally added a word.
The lady, who was so afraid of touching the dignity of her
friends, had not heard her less exclusive lord whisper to the
two cotton-spinners, “I’m afraid I’ve committed a grave mis-
demeanour in Mrs. Ashton’s sight, by bringing young Clegg
among our party ; but kings are not crowned every day, and I
thought it a good opportunity to bring a worthy lad out. You
and I "—and he tapped his snuff-box—“ know what Manchester
men are made of, and that young fellow has good stuff in him t
He was made to rise, sirs.”
Mr. Ashton’s friends nodded in acquiescence, and willing to
humour their kindly host, and perhaps desirous to test the
calibre of an aspirant so introduced, wittingly or unwittingly
did their part in helping him to “ rise” by the very distinction
of their prolonged attention. It was an act quite in the way of
_{Ohn McConnell, who had already given a lift to his rising
young countryman, Fairbairn the engineer. '1" ‘r‘ '
Presently Mr. Chadwick, beckoning attentive Ellen to‘hi-s
side, and using her shoulder as a support, involuntarily seconded
his brother-in-law by joining the group, and, putting out his hand
to Jabez (who rose at his approach, and offered his own seat to
the paralytic gentleman), said— '
“ Wha-at inter-rests yo-you so m-much, M-Mr. Clegg, th-that

“ N 0, Sir, I had not forgotten you, nor MISS Chadwrck

“We were discussing the inﬂuence of art on our local manu-
factures,” added Henry Liverseege, and thereupon the subject
was resumed, Ellen necessarily in close attendance on her
father, standing there with sparkling black eyes, an animated
and attentive listener, well pleased that Mr. Clegg’s merits (as
seen by her) had at length found recognition.
Meanwhile Augusta, the centre of a group of young people,
indulged in sentimental chit-chat, and triﬂing with her fan and
human hearts, completed the enslavement of her last admirer,
a fair-haired Mr. Marsland ; while Jabez, from his distant seat,
looked and longed in vain.
Cards were, as a matter of course, proposed for the amuse-
ment of this extemporised party; and in ﬁlling up tables for
whist or 100, Mrs. Ashton’s fears for the sensibility of her
friends were forgotten. They were utterly put to the rout by a
oud rat-tat-tat at the street-door, followed by the entrance of
Mr. Clough and the Reverend Joshua Brookes, the latter less
vigorous than of yore, but in a state of unusual excitement.
His loud voice was heard before he was seen. “ Hogs, sir,
hogs ! They are no better than hogs, sir !” he was saying even
as he came into the drawing-room. He appeared too much
ruffled to respond composedly to the kindly greetings of his
many friends 3 even Augusta, who put forth her little white hand
with her most winning smile, attracted no more attention than
a hurried “ How d’ye do, lass P How d’ye do P”
“What is the matter, Mr. Brooks P You seem—”
“ He interrupted Mr. Ashton’s inquiry with—-
“ Matter, sir? Waste and riot, intemperance and indecency,
are the matter. These old eyes have seen that which is enough
to bring a curse upon the coronation and a blight upon the
town.”
Conversation was arrested, ﬂirtation forgot its part, cards
were laid down, save by three or four inveterate players, and
young and old were alike on the guz' 212.06, crowding round the
speaker.
“ Permit me,” said Mr. Clough, commencing an explanation.
“I suppose you are all aware that the new market in Shude
Hill is the chief station of the nine appointed for the distribu-
tion of meat, bread, and ale to the populace?”
“ Populace, indeed l—the very scum and dregs of the town
—say rather the lowest, roughest rabble l” broke in old Joshua.
“Well, Parson, for the credit of our working population, let
us hope so,” chimed in Mr. Clough, resuming~—“ Whilst Mr.

Brookes and I were at tea in his sanctum, Tabitha ran in
breathless to tell us that the platform erected for recipients in
front of the storehouse had given way, that several persons
were injured, and one had been killed on the spot.
“Ah !” said the Parson, drawing a long breath between his
teeth, while Jabez, unobserved by either, drew nearer to listen,
and the ladies put up their hands in horror.
“It was not our most direct route, but either curiosity or
compassion took us round by Shude Hill Market on our road
hither, and never shall I forget the scene we witnessed. Loaves
and junks of meat were being pitched high and far amongst
the crowd from the warehouse doors and windows, as if ﬂung
to hounds.”
“ Hounds, sir i” burst in impatient Joshua, “don’t slander
the better animal. Only the commonest curs would have yelped,
and scrambled, and struggled, and fought for their rations, as
did the human beasts we saw clutching and gripping from
weaker women and children that which had fallen within their
reach, or trampling in the mud underfoot the ,food they were
too greedy or too drunk to devour. Ay, mud, for the very
kennels ran with ale thrown in pitchers-full amongst the people,
to be caught in hats, and bonnets, and hollowed hands, as if it
were rain in an African desert. Ale ! the atmosphere reeked of
ale! Men, women, and children of all ages carried it away, or
drank it from all sorts of vessels ; reeled, hiccoughed, and
staggered under their burden, or sank down by the wayside;
whilst others, shouting like maniacs, drained the half-empty
mugs. I tell you, sirs, Captain Cook never fell in with greater
savages. Even death and disaster in their midst had not awed
them! Ugh ! I say again they are hogs, absolute hogs !”
As Joshua paused to take breath, and sank into a chair, Jabez
modestly put the question to the excitable chaplain—
“Do you not think the distributors are most to blame for
this wanton waste and excess, to say nothing of the loss of
life? Surely the arrangements of the committee must have
been defective.”
The Parson’s harsh tones softened as he put out his hand to
grasp the speaker’s.
“Ay, Jabez, lad, is that thee? I’m glad to see thee here ”
—and he laid emphasis on the word—“Ay, the distributors-
are answerable for ”
But the personal recognition had created a diversion. The
question Jabez had mooted was talked over by separate knots

of individuals in different quarters of the large room, whilst
Mr. Clough, to Mrs. Ashton’s amazement—yes, and gratiﬁca_
tion also—shook the salesman warmly by the hand, and con-
gratulated him on_his apparent success. Moreover, he bore
him away to Mrs. Clough, at the loo-table, and called her at-
tention to the change time had effected in the old tanner’s
foster-child, in the most cordial manner.
Thanks to Mr. Ashton, Mr. Clegg had truly got his ﬁrst
foot into Manchester society that coronation-day, and his old
hopes might have revived, had not a disturbing element crept
into the room during the denunciatory oration of his clerical
friend.
John Walmsley, not ﬁnding his wife at home when released
from yeomanry duty, had come in quest of her, bringing two
of his comrades; and when Mr. Clegg retired from the loo-
table with a bow, his eye fell ﬁrst on the conspicuous ﬁgure
of Captain Travis, in the silver-and-blue glory of uniform,
bending deferentially to address Miss Chadwick ; and in ano-
ther moment on the elegant Adonis he had dragged from
icy death, toying with Miss Augusta’s carved ivory fan, and
whispering low to her, whilst she hid her India-muslin robe
and too eloquent face behind the screen of her convenient
harp, and drew her flexible ﬁngers lightly across the chords.
The lustre of that evening’s introduction was dimmed for
Jabez. Augusta scarcely looked at him as she brushed past
to supper, leaning on the arm of Lieutenant Aspinall, her
white dress in strong contrast to his dark uniform; and no
doubt his pain was pictured on his face, for Ellen Chadwick
,sighed, as she too passed him with her martial cavalier, and
half turned to look pitifully as she went.
There was no lack of ladies, so Mrs. Ashton paired Mr.
Clegg off with a chatty damsel of thirty or thereabouts, and
he did his best to listen and make himself agreeable, but not
even the novelty of his situation could keep his thoughts or
his eyes from wandering where they should not.
Along the whole course of the procession the Manchester
Yeomanry had been greeted with more hisses and- groans than
cheers. This had chafed their noble spirits, and on disbandmg
they had sought consolation in the winecup, which temperate
Jabez was not slow to observe, although their degree of ex-
hilaration was not then considered a disqualiﬁcation for the
drawing-room or for the society of ladies.
Mr. Ashtpn’s strong home-brewed supper ale was not a

sedative, yet still Augusta smiled on Laurence, in spite of her
mother’s frowns, driving Mr. Marsland to desperation, and
Jabez to despair.
Indeed, he was glad when the repast was over, for then
Joshua Brookes rose to depart, sober as when he sat dowm,
and the Chadwicks also. He had thus an opportunity of
escaping from his torment, by offering his escort to tottering
Mr. Chadwick and the parson in succession, if the latter did
not object to the slight detour. Jabez foresaw that Mr.
Travis was ready to do Miss Chadwick suit and service; but
in offering his arm to assist the slow feet of the disabled
father, he little dreamed how gladly the daughter would have
made an exchange; nor, had he been wiser, would he have
thrust himself in big Ben’s way, any more than would Mrs.
Chadwick, who openly favoured the “personable and unim-
peachable” captain.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD.
CLOGS-
EAVING the Chadwicks at their own door, where Cap~
tain Travis would fain have lingered had he been en-
couraged, Jabez and he fell back as guards to their reverend
friend, whose excitability might otherwise have involved him
in some unpleasantness, so disorderly a riff-raft" occupied the
streets.
Turning down Church Street, they pursued their dimly—
lighted way along Cannon Street, (so named from dismounted
cannon captured from “ rebels” which served as corner posts),
through Hanging Ditch to Hyde’s Cross; thence past the
deserted Apple Market, and Dr. Smith’s ancient labyrinth of a
house, to the Parson’s less antiquated domicile in the corner
by the Grammar School and those College-gates which had
been the portals of peace and promise to Jabez, and not only
to him, but to hundreds besides.
The excitement of old Joshua had been toned down amongst
the wax-lights and pleasant faces around the Ashtons’ well-spread
supper-table, and at ﬁrst he was disposed to be conversable
after' his own peculiar manner. They had purposely avoided
Shude-Hill Market by an ample circuit ; but stragglers of both
sexes from the scene of riot lay maundering or asleep in their
path, or crossed it at every turn, in all stages of inebriation and
disorder; until the natural irritability of the chaplain (increased
by failing health) broke forth in loud-voiced indignation, ending
in a wail that he was “ getting old and powerless,” or he would
“rise like another John Knox, and denounce the wickedness
rampant in the land.”
“A good man lives there, Jabez,” said he, pointing to the
black-and-white home of the head-master, where lighted windows
told of hospitality awake, “ a good man, but for whom I should
not be alive to tell you ; but there are those in the pglpit, my

lads, whom the Church ought to spue out, lest they poison
the ﬂocks it is their duty to feed. Can the stream be pure if
the fountain be polluted P And how shall we rebuke the gross
excesses of the untaught rabble whilst chambering, gluttony,
and drunkenness deﬁle~the high places of the land? Ugh!
There wants another flood to wash Europe sweet and clean.
The sin on the earth was not greater in the days of Noah 2”
They were crossing the space before the two closed gates
when he paused for lack of breath; and Travis, with no
thought but to change the subject, observed to Jabez, over the
head of the panting pastor—
“ How quiet this little nook of ground is now ! Yet to me
and no doubt to you, Mr. Clegg, it is haunted by ghosts of old
times!”
That set Joshua off again.
“ Ugh ! to hear a lad of ﬁve-and-twenty talk of old times !
What’s the world coming to? Ghosts indeed I It had like to
have been haunted by ghosts of something more than old times
as Jabez and I know to our cost. I’ve never been right since
the young rufﬁans had me in their clutches ! And mark you,
my lads, and think of it when you have young ones of your
own to rear: there’s no worse sign for a country or a family
than when the young jibe and jeer, mock and scorn their
elders. When grey hairs fail to command respect, virtue,
principle, and religion are at their lowest ebb.” '
He stood within his own gate as he said this, and as
Tabitha opened the door for her master, he checked all reply
with— '
“There! you’ve had a sermon for nothing. Ugh! you’ll
forget it when the old man’s back turns. Good night, lads!
See you steer clear of brawls, and give drunken fools a wide
berth.”
Leaving the young men so abruptly dismissed to retrace
their steps towards Hyde’s Cross, it may be as well if we
throw a light on some of Parson Brookes’s dark allusions.
Time had not smoothed the old man’s eccentricities, nor
modiﬁed the antagonism between the Grammar School boys
and the ex-master. They were always at war, and there never
was wanting a earns belli. The previous September he had
been more than usually irritated by a lampoon which began—
“ O Jotty, you dog,
Your house we well know
Is headquarters of prog——-"

the purport of which was to ﬁx on him the stigma of inviting
a friend to dine, and regaling him with a black-pudding only.
Lashed to fury, he burst into the Grammar School when the
ﬁrst and second-form boys were assembled in the afternoon to
rehearse the speeches which, according to custom, they were
to deliver in public at the annual commemoration in October.
He braved them in his hottest style, winding up with, “You
are a set of blockheads! I would not come to hear your
speeches if you would pay me for it I”
There was a general cry, “ T urn him out! Turnghim out !”
But Jotty would not be turned out. He stuck himself in the
doorway with his legs against the door-post, and his back
against the door itself, to the extreme risk of broken limbs,
whilst his young and vigorous opponents brought their strength
to bear upon the door to force him out.
With such odds he was sure to be overcome ; but, driven
into the yard, he fought with »his antagonists like a mastiff at
bay, and they, like the cowards they must have been, to
have assailed in a body an old man (under any provocation),
by sheer force of numbers, bore him backwards to the wall,
and, but for the opportune arrival of Dr. Smith, would have
1rjepeated the outrage perpetrated on Jabez Clegg eight years
efore.
He might well say Dr. Smith had saved his life. Such a
fall, whether in high or low water, to so old a man, would have
been certain destruction. They broke his heart, I think, if
they did not break his limbs, for he never was the same man
afterwards. Even old Mrs. Clowes used to rally him on his
frequent “ ﬁts of the dumps.”
Whether Jabez and Ben Travis had, or had not, lost sight
of the Parson’s homily, they were linked arm in arm, the rich
yeomanry ofﬁcer and the unpretending smallware-salesman,
just as, nearly nine years previously, the big, raw-boned youth,
with a heart large enough to match his frame, had linked his
arm in that of the poor Blue-coat boy, as a friend and
protector, when as yet his admittance into society was un-
dreamed of.
Where the four roads met at Hyde’s Cross, a staggering
Charlie (as the watchmen were called, much as, at this day,
they are Bobbies) passed them, with his horn lantern and staff,
and his rattle in his belt, proclaiming——
“Past ten o’clock ! (hiccup). “And a foin moonleet neet l”

to ascertain if Joshua Brookes had spoken sooth, or, in his
spleen exaggerated, they turned up Shude-hill, all alive with
people who were ordinarily at that hour in bed, and made their
way to the market. .
Exaggerate! Joshua Brookes had seen but in part, and
painted but in part. Every avenue to the market was a scene
of debauchery. Hogarth’s print of “Gin Lane ” was feeble
"beside it. The distribution of food was over, but that of
drink continued. The oil-lamps of the street, the dying illu-
mination lamps, and the misty moonlight showed a picture of
unimaginable grossness ; whilst their ears were assailed with
foulness which would have shocked a hardened man of the
world—how much more these inexperienced young friends!
Children, men, and women, their clothes torn or disarrayed,
lay singly, or in groups, on the paths, or in the gutters, asleep
or awake, drunk, sick, helpless, exposed; there was ﬁghting
and cursing over the ale yet procurable ; there were loaves in
the gutters, and meat trampled in the mire ; food which, pro-
perly distributed, would have gladdened many a poor, hard~
working family, too self-respecting to join that clamorous mob.
The two young men turned away sick and disgusted.
I “ Henry Hunt, in advocating the disuse of excisable liquors,”
said Jabez, thoughtfully, “may only have designed to cripple
the Government ; but surely no one could witness scenes like
these, whether Whig or Tory, without feeling that some restric-
tion on drink is absolutely necessary for the safety of the
State and the comfort of the people.”
"You are right, Mr. Clegg,” responded Travis, heartily.
“Men of all politics ought to meet on this ground. I shall
see how far my little inﬂuence goes to check intemperance
henceforth. Something must be done, and that promptly.”
“Whatever I can do to second you, you may depend on,
though beyond our own warehouse my opportunities are small,”
said Jabez ; “ still, if I can inﬂuence one within our walls, that
one may act on two outside, and so we may prevail in the end.”
“Yes,” added Travis, “and if this night be not eloquent
_ in its protest against drink, all humanity must be equally de-
based and brutalised.” '
Some caution had been necessary to cross the Market, so as
to avoid insult, the captain’s bulk and uniform rendering him
conspicuous, and his corps being in anything but good odour.
They had kept well within the shade of the pillared piazza
which extended along the side to their right, and, stunned by'

the uproar of brawling and ﬁghting crowds, picked their way
between degraded humanity in heaps on the pavement, crushed
hats and bonnets, torn caps and shawls, boots and shoes which
had done duty as drinking vessels, sodden meat and bread, and
had much ado to avoid splashing through puddles of ale and
other abominations. They had emerged into Oak Street, glad
to have got tolerably clear of the clamour and brutality, when
a cry from the direction of Tib Street, “Watch ! help ! watch I”
fell on their ears in tones which had a strangely familiar ring
to Jabez.
Hastening on at a run, they came upon a decently-dressed
man struggling against three or four drunken ruﬁians with
heavy clogs on their feet. They had got the man down, and
were vociferating with oaths not to be repeated here.
“ Gi’e him a lick wi’ thi clog!” “ Punce him well ! ” “ Shut
up his tater-trap fur him l” “ Purr him i’ th’ bread-basket”
“ Fettle his mug wi’ thi clog ! ”
Before Jabez and his companion could prevent it, a heavy
thud, followed by a groan, told of a brutal kick; the two only
dashed among them in time to arrest the other clogs, already
on the backward swing for force ; and' saved the prostrate
man by turning the fury of the savages on themselves. The
cowardly brutes, however, stood little chance against sobriety
and skill, backed by the muscular frame of Jabez and the her-
culean one of Travis, even though they carried weapons of
offence on their feet, and plied them vigorously ; and before a
droning watchman hove in sight to spring his rattle for assist-
ance, they were overmastered or put to the rout.
Most thankful was Jabez for the impulse which had directed
their steps that way when, on raising the fallen man, the light
of an adjacent oil-lamp projecting from the wall fell on his
blood-stained face, and revealed Tom Hulme, who had been
drawn into that unusually disorderly neighbourhood by like
curiOsity with their own, and been set upon without provocation.
He walked with pain, and they supported his steps to the
Inﬁrmary, not ﬁnding Mr. Huertley, on whom they called, at
home. But so fertile had that evening been of serious injuries,
he was some time before he could obtain attention. Thirteen
far more urgent cases had preceded his. At length'his head
and cut lip were plaistered up, a reviving draught administered,
and after some examination of bruises, and poking and pressing
of his body, three of his ribs were pronounced “broken.”
His defenders were disposed to smile at the surgeon when,

besides an embrocation for bruises, he prescribed “a succes-
sion of oatmeal poultices applied internally "—in other words,
a cushion of as much oatmeal porridge as the patient could
consume, to press the crushed ribs gently into position.
It was, however, not much of a laughing matter to Tom
Hulme, or to loving Bess, who looked aghast at this deplorable
termination of a day’s jollity. Nor was there a trace of mirth
on the face of Jabez when at parting with Ben Travis on the
Mosley Street door-step, he gripped, more in pain than plea-
sure, the big hand extended so cordially.
It was after midnight, but from the open windows of the still-
lighted drawing-room the thin quick ears of jabez had caught
the sound of Augusta’s melodious voice blending with that
of Laurence Aspinall in a popular duet, although the notes of
the latter were neither so clear nor so steady as they might
have been. The pallor on her foster-son’s face Bess attributed
to tender-hearted sympathy for her injured husband ; but jabez
hurried away from her oppressive thanks to the solitude of his
own chamber, where he could bury his face in his quivering
hands, and unseen wrestle with emotions of which she had no
conception.
Never had he known a day so chequered. The same, sun
which had looked down at noontide on the triumph of his
amateur brush, had beamed on Augusta Ashton’s conscious
cheeks, as she accepted his rival’s familiar act of gallantry with-
out so much as a frown. The evening had made a man of him
—lifted him into a new sphere—brought him, so to speak,
nearer to his divinity, within the radius of her smiles, the music
of her voice. She had put her small white hand within his, and
blessed him with a word or two of shy recognition ,- but
Laurence Aspinall had again come like a cloud between him
and his sunbeam,- her sweetest smiles, her softest tones, were
for the intruder ; her arm had rested willingly on his, her voice
had blent with his in sentimental song, and darkness once more
shut out hope from Jabez.
“Common sense might have taught me that my love was
folly, presumption, madness!” he argued with himself; “that
the heiress of a wealthy man would not stoop to her father’s
Blue-coat apprentice. But oh ! ” he grOaned, “ I had hoped to
raise myself step by step nearer to her level—to make myself
worthy of her as a man, if I had not riches to lay at her feet.
She is young, and what might I not accomplish with industry
ere she came of age P but now—_”

He tore his neckcloth off, and cast it from him, stripped off
coat and vest, and ﬂung them aside, as though they held his
passionate folly, and he had done with it, then sank into a
chair, the very impersonation of listless hopelessness. He had
gone through all this struggle once before, and thought he had
overcome his weakness; but at the touch of the enchanter’s
wand love had blazed up afresh, and was not to be smothered.
His reverie was broken into by the tread of many feet on the
staircase below, and the murmur of voices calling one to
another ; the hall-door shut with a clang, and then a light foot
came tripping up the stair alone, and from heart and lips
dropped unconsciously the soft refrain of that too well-known
duet. She, too, was, carrying to her chamber memories of the
night, and bearing the burden blithely.
He listened until a door closed upon step and song. Then
as if its echoes pierced his soul, he set his teeth and clenched
his outstretched hands in mute agony. There was more than
hopeless love in this—there was jealousy also. Then he
murmured half audibly, “ If he were only worthy of her I
could bear it better ; but to see her cast her heart at the feet of
one who will trample on it, is beyond mortal endurance.”
He started to his feet. A bright thought irradiated his face.
“Coward that I am ! I am quitting the battle without '
striking a blow. I am myself unworthy of Augusta if I
surrender her to a heartless proﬂigate without an effort to save
her. ‘Faint heart never won fair lady.’ Women have stooped
lower, and lowly men have looked higher ere now. I am
making way, but I must make money too, if I would look
above me. Father and mother look on me with favour, and
why not the daughter P She may learn the worthlessness of
the ﬁne gentleman in time. Courage, Jabez ! Work with a
will ; do your duty. Miss no opportunity, and the gold and
the goddess may both be yours in the end, and honestly won.”,
He sprang into bed fresher and lighter than he had been all
day, the prayer of that other Jabez rising from his heart with
the fervour of old times.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
’ HE Palace Inn on the north side of Market Street Lane
was the last relic of that cramped thoroughfare to dis-
appear at the bidding of Improvement. Possibly because its
many eyes and bald dark-red-brick face looked out on a space
so much beyond the twenty-one yards assigned by Act of
Parliament to the regenerated street that the Improvement
Committee had no powers to meddle with it, for surely its
historic associations were not suﬂicient to protect it. Prince
Charles Edward had been hospitably lodged and entertained
beneath its roof by its owner, Mr. Dickenson, long ere it be-
came an inn ,- he had harangued his devoted followers from the
stone plateau of its double ﬂight of steps, with his hand per-
chance on its smooth rail of unornamented iron ; but in isolated
dignity rather than palatial pretensions lay its chief safeguard.
Be that as it may, fourteen or ﬁfteen years elapsed between the
ﬁrst act of demolition, for widening (at the shop of a Mr.
Maund), and that last feat of narrowing, which blocked up and
darkened history (as represented by the Palace) with common
stone warehouses for every-day merchandise. Alas ! Clio and
all her sister muses must succumb when Mammon is on the
march !
But Mammon had only got his ﬁrst foot in the street on that
Thursday morning in July, which blushed at the doings of the
Coronation night, and the Palace Inn yet held its head high as
beseemed its historic state. The open space in front was
enlivened by the newly-painted London stage-coach, the Lord
Nelson, the fresh scarlet coats of coachmen and guards, the as-
sembling of passengers and luggage, the shouting and swearing
of half-awake ostlers and porters, the grumbling of the ﬁrst-
comers (shivering in the raw air) at the unpunctuality of the stage,
the excuses of the booking-clerk, the self-gratulations of the last

arrival that he was “in time," the dragging of trunks and port-
manteaus on to the top, the thrusting of bags and boxes into
the boot, the harnessing of snorting steeds, the horsing of the
vehicle, the scrambling of the “outsiders” to the top by the
ladder and wheel, the self~satisﬁed settlement of the “insides”
in the places they had “ booked for,” the crushing and thrust~
ing of friends with last messages and parting words, the crack
of the whip, the sound of the bugle, the prancing of horses, the
rattle of wheels, and the dashing off up Market Street Lane
of the gallant four-in-hand amid the hurrahs of excited
spectators.
Every morning witnessed a somewhat similar scene of bustle
and excitement at ﬁve o’clock, when the London coach started,
but every morning did not see Jabez mounted on the box-seat
with the coachman. Nor did every morning see the coach an
hour behind time, or the driver’s face quite so red, or the spec-
tators so heavy-eyed, or so much handing up of horns and
glasses to the passengers, to be returned empty, or leave Mr.
Ashton standing there when the Lord Nelson had bowled away.
That Coronation day had much to answer for.
When Tom Hulme should have risen at four o’clock to
return home, his bruised limbs were so stiff and sore that the
soldier, who had borne the fatigue of many a campaign, who
had bivouacked on the battle-ﬁeld after a forced march, and
been ready with the sun for the day’s duties, had to confess
himself “ fettled ” by Lancashire clogs, and unable to stir.
There was no alternative but to acquaint Mr. Ashton. The
mill could not be left without a manager.
After the night’s unwonted dissipation, Mr. Ashton slept
heavily, and was with diﬁiculty aroused. When once he com-
prehended the state of affairs, he was on the alert.
“ It’s a bad business !” said he to his wife as he dressed in
haste.
“ ‘ There is nothing so bad, but it might be worse, was her
consolatory reply. “Never bewail a loss till you have done
your best to repair it. Can you not send Mr. Clegg to Whaley-
Bridge for a few days ? ”
“ My dear, your counsel is invaluable, but I fear there is not
time to catch the coach ,- it is twenty minutes past four now.”
“ It is sure to be late this morning, and Jabez will catch it if
it is to be caught,” was her quick rejoinder.
Bess had already awakened Jabez, and he, fully dressed, met
Mr. Ashton at his bedroom door with “ Can I be of any ser-

vice, sir?” A prompt commentary on Mrs. Ashton’s declara-
tion.
A few necessaries hastily crammed into a carpet bag; a
bowl of milk and a crust of bread as hastily swallowed,- and
Jabez, accompanied by Mr. Ashton, was on his way to the
Palace coach-ofﬁce conﬁdent they were in time, not having
heard the guard’s bugle, or met the coach. There was, how-
ever, barely time to claim for Mr. Clegg the place already
booked for “Mr. Hulme” (Mrs. Hulme’s seat was forfeited),
and for him to take his seat, before they were off in a canter,
and Mr. Ashton’s business mind was relieved.
As the manufacturer, satisﬁed that the mill-hands at Whaley-
Bridge would not be left altogether to their own devices, stood
within a short distance of the high steps looking after the
vanishing coach, a party of . roisterers came swaggering out of
the inn, hallooing with all their tipsy might. One in advance
of the rest, observing an elderly gentleman below, pointed him
out to his companions as fair game, and leaning over the rail to
steady himself, cried out—
“'Halloo, old fogey ! are you a Tory or a Radical? D
me, take your hat off before gentlemen!” and, suiting the
action to the word, extended a riding-whip he carried, and
jerked Mr. Ashton’s hat off into the dust; whereupon his
worthy comrades set up a loud guffaw in admiration of the
feat.
Naturally Mr. Ashton, his brief reverie disturbed, stooped to
pick up the fallen beaver, and making due allowance for the
unwonted occasion, turned to remonstrate good-humouredly
with an excited stranger who had evidently drunk the king’s
health too frequently.
It was not with more surprise than annoyance that he recog—
nised four of the hilarious party in the doorway and on the
steps of the inn, 'which had apparently been open the night
through. Not one of the four was in a condition to recognise
him, although two of them, John Walmsley and Laurence
Aspinall, had supped overnight at his own table, although the
third, Kit Townley, had good reason for remembrance, and
Ned Barret was anything but a stranger.
Loud laughter hailed the fall of the hat. A second attempt
to “ uncover the obstinate old fogey ” was made, but dexterously
avoided by Mr. Ashton in his absolute astonishment stepping
backward beyond range. '
‘Young gentlemen, do you know whom you are insulting?”



## p. 243 (#255) ############################################

T ﬁe ﬁrmware-Mm. ' 2413'
There was another laughing chorus. Aspinall almost toppled
over the rail as he leaned forward, impotently striking out with
his whip. _
“ I protest the old rad’s demnibly li-ike the lovely Augusta’s
snuffy old dad,” drawled out he, in a sort of tipsy-wisdom.
“Just so i” appended Walmsley, mimicking the old gentle-
man’s peculiarity. ,
Mr. Ashton, though a reasonably temperate man himself,
was not so greatly shocked at these young carousers as we
might be. Long usage blunts sensibilities. - It was a glorious
distinction to be a three-bottle man 3 the inability to drink a
solitary bottle of wine at a sitting was a sort of disqualiﬁcation
for good fellowship ; and it was considered a ﬁne thing for a
boy of seven to “toss off a glass like a man 3 ” so the genial
old gentleman was inclined to allow some latitude for the
special occasion. But they had touched him on a tender
point. The light mention of his darling daughter’s name
roused his blood.
“John Walmsley,” he cried angrily, looking up, “what
brings you, a married man, with these young rakes at this hour
of the morning? ”
“ Pray wha-at brought y-you here, old fogey?” hiccoughed
Aspinall, answering for the other.
One of the ostlers—Bob, the ex-groom—squeezed between
the rollicking fellows to whisper in the ear of Laurence. He
was impatiently thrust back with an elbow.
“Tchut! don’t believe it. Old snuff-an’-tuppeny’s fast
’shleep in bed shure sh a gun. I know b-better. I say,
on 7,
But “old snuff-an’-tuppeny had turned on his heel, too
wise to enter into contention with a set of inebriated boobies,
though not proof against the disrespectful epithets of Laurence,
or the derisive laughter of his boon companions. Hisirritation
half emptied his snuff-box before he got home, so often he
tapped smartly on its golden lid, and so often his ﬁnger and
thumb travelled between it and his nose with a touch of
ruminant displeasure.
Neither he nor Mrs. Ashton was disposed to overlook the fact
that Kit Townley and Ned Barret—scapegraces by repute—
were of the party, nor that Augusta’s name had been familiarly
used in their midst. -
“ ‘ Birds of a feather ﬂock together,’ ” said the lady ,' “and
if Mr. Aspinall’s son associates with that reckless and dis-

honest Kit Townley, he is a very unﬁt friend for John
Walmsley, and still worse for our dear Augusta.” \
“Just so; for a dashing blade with a handsome face, who
sports a uniform, talks poetry, and sings sentimental songs, is
just the fellow to take a'silly girl’s fancy, before she is old
enough to think. I know I regret I ever brought him here,”
said Mr. Ashton seriously, as Augusta came in the room to
breakfast, entering at the door behind her mother’s back.
“ Well, William,” observed Mrs. Ashton loftily, her hand on
the china coffee-pot, “you can imagine my annoyance when
John and Mr. Laurence walked in arm-in-arm last night, after
the liberty he had taken in the morning—kissing his hand to
our daughter from the public procession in the face of all our
friends, as if Augusta had been a ﬂaunting barmaid. I was
most indignant ! ”
Augusta said “ Good morning,” and took her seat with a
heightened colour. Such a construction of the gallant ofﬁcer’s
salute had not occurred to her, and native delicacy took alarm.
Mrs. Ashton continued to pour out her thoughts along with
the coffee. It was ﬁt Augusta should know her sentiments
on this head.
“It would have been a breach of hospitality to resent it
before our friends, and not good policy either. But I shall
put a stop to his visits henceforth.”
“ Oh! mamma,” exclaimed Augusta, dropping her hands
at this climax, “you cannot mean that l”
“Yes, my dear, I do. If Mr. Aspinall has depraved asso-
ciates, he must be depraved himself; and I am sure my
daughter ”-—she drew herself up proudly—“ would not choose
her friends from those of Christopher Townley.” '
Augusta’s colour suﬁ'ered no decrease. She paused as she
was taking her dry toast from the silver rack, and half-hesi-
tatingly remonstrated.
“Of course I should not wish to associate with Mr.
Townley’s friends. But papa may be mistaken. I do not
think Mr. Aspinall would mix with them. People meet and
mingle at coach-ofﬁces who are strangers.”
“Just so, my dear ; but ” interposed her father.
“Why, mamma,” the persistent young lady' went on, “no
more perfect gentleman enters our doors than Mr. Laurence
Aspinall. His manners are most reﬁned. Then he talks
enchantingly, and sings divinely. And "—this she thought
conclusrve—“ is he not intimate with Charlotte and John ?”



## p. 245 (#257) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 245
“Just so,” quickly answered Mr. Ashton, glancing across
the table at his attentive wife, “and all the worse for Char-
lotte and John. I shall have a word with them on the
subject. I called in Marsden Square on my way home, and
found Charlotte with red eyes. John had not been home all
night.” And Mr. Ashton battered the top of an egg whilst
delivering what he regarded as a crushing argument.
Breakfast and the discussion were unusually prolonged,
the only impression left on the young lady’s romantic, im-
pressible, and inexperienced mind being that her parents
were unaccountably harsh to her, and unjust to Mr. Laurence,
in her eyes the beau-ideal of a man. Such a ﬁgure and
such a face could only enshrine divinity. And if he was a
little wild, so were all heroes at his age.
Let not the inexperienced young girl he over-much con-
demned for this. The opinion generally prevailed in her
day; she had heard the sentiment expressed in farces on the
stage, in society at home and elsewhere; even her own
father’s hospitality trended in the same direction.
Mrs. Ashton was a woman of her word. The door in
Mosley Street was closed against Mr. Laurence Aspinall, and
James was incorruptible.
But the teaching of Miss Bohanna’s library being that
Love was far-seeing and parents were blind, it followed that
Miss Augusta (who would have resented any supposition of
wilful disobedience or intentional disrespect towards the good
father and mother she loved so dearly) met the fascinating
gentleman (always by chance) either at her cousin’s in Mars-
den Square or'in her walks abroad, and scented billet-doux
came and went between the leaves of four-volumed romances,
which Cicily carried to and from the library. One of these
fell into Mrs. Ashton’s hands, when ﬁnding her advice con-
temned, she took measures to check this premature and clan-
destine love-making, as she thought, effectually.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH.
AT CARR COTTAGE.
OM HULME was most anxious to get back to Whaley-
Bridge and the mill, and motherly Bess was equally
uneasy to return to her poor little Sim, afraid lest he should
tax his grandfather’s strength over-much, or meet with some
fresh accident. Yet more than a week elapsed before her
husband was ﬁt to travel, and in the interim Mr. Ashton
had himself gone thither to ascertain how the new substitute
ﬁlled the post.
He was still at Carr Cottage when the “ Lord Nelson ”
stopped at the end of the avenue, and Jabez, with fragile
Sim mounted on his shoulder, trotted down to the gate to
welcome Bess and her invalid home. They had travelled
inside, but John Loudon Mac-Adam had not yet been ap-
pointed “ Surveyor of Roads,” and Tom Hulme had suffered
severely from the jolting of the coach.
Bess clasped her child tenderly, and held him up for his
father’s kiss; but she put him down to walk on before them
(he could not run), whilst she and Jabez helped the injured
corporal to ascend the steep incline. ld Simon, who seemed
to have got a new lease of life from the invigorating country
air and occupation, had' already breakfasted, and was in the
bean-ﬁeld gathering the ﬁrst ripe pods for a dinner of beans
and bacon. _
“Eh, Tum, lad !” said he, as he entered the house-place,
and saw his son-in-law’s pale face against the blue-and-white
check cover of the arm-chair, “whoi, thi feace is as whoite
as a clout! Tha’ll noan be ﬁt to wark fur one whoile.
Thah’s nobbut ﬁt fur t’ sit under th’ sycymoore tree, an’
look at th’ ﬂeawers, an’ watch me put th’ garden i’ fettle.”
“Just so,” said Mr. Ashton, bringing his pleasant face in at
the door ; “I think Mr. Clegg will have to do duty for you a
246

while longer. And don’t distress yourself about it, Mr. Hulme,
for I fancy a little fresh air will do him no harm this hot
weather ; he has been overworking lately, and does not look
too brisk.”
“You are very kind, sir,” responded Jabez, “but I trust a
few days’ rest will set Mr. Hulme on his feet again.” He said
nothing of himself. ,
But Tom Hulme had received unsuspected internal injuries,
and many weeks went by before he was stout as before—weeks
pregnant with fate for Jabez ; and not Jabez alone.
Factory hours were long, but the Summer days were longer,
and he was glad after work was over to ramble away through
the valley of the Goyt, following the winding of the stream, or
over the larch-clad hills above Taxal, whence he would return
with the rising moon, bringing pockets full of the crisp-brown
ﬁr-cones for Sim to play with. In the pine-woods, alone with
nature, he could give vent to his emotions, or indulge in medi-
tation at his will.
Mr. Ashton, however, found him other occupation for his
spare hours. The landlord of the “White Hart,” bearing in
mind that Mr. Clegg had come under his roof ﬁrst as a travel-
ling artist, had expatiated to Mr. Ashton with much pathos on
the deplorable condition of the inn sign, not without sundry
broad hints that Mr. Clegg’s temporary residence on the spot
was a glorious opportunity not to be neglected. Mr. Ashton
had smiled, said “ Just so,”v taking a pinch from the immense
snuff-box lying on the bar-parlour chimney-piece, then fallen
back upon his own, gone away, and forgot the dingy sign alto-
gether, until another hint from his tenant refreshed his
memory. \
As he stood at the inn door waiting for the Manchester
coach, an upward sly glance of the jolly host’s caused him to say
to the young man by his side, “ Do you think you could manage
to paint a new sign for the ‘ White Hart,’ to oblige Chapman
and me P ”
Jabez hesitated, not from unwillingness.
“I’m afraid, si ‘, to attempt. It’s not in my line, and—”
“ Oh ! you can do it well enough. Remember the banner.”
“I’ve no materials here, sir, else——” '
“ If that is all, you shall have them in a day or two.”
In a few days an easel, a new sign-board, and colours were
sent by the Manchester and Buxton carrier, and Jabez set to
work, to the especial wonder [and admiration of little Sim, who

delighted to stand by his side, and grew rebellious when “ bed-
time ” was announced. Jabez was, however, but an untaught
artist, and his painting hours were few ; the cone/um! hart was
rubbed in and wiped out over and over again before he was
satisﬁed even with the outline ,' but then it grew in fair propor-
tion under his brush, until he felt there was something in him
beyond the region of tapes and braces.
The graceful animal, resplendent in golden collar and chain,
looked mildly out from the easel in the parlour nearest to the
passage (used, when the family was there, as an eating-room),
and little Sim gravely reported to his elders it only wanted
“ gass, an’ tee, an’ ky,” when the inmates of Carr Cottage were
startled by the arrival of unexpected visitors.
It was the second week in August ; the air was heavy with
the perfume of clove carnations, honeysuckle, mignonette,
lavender, musk, and mint. Golden sunﬂower and crimson
hollyhock were in their glory ; bees and wasps hovered over
balsams and china asters, or hid themselves in the blue Canter.
bury bells or the amber nectary of the stately white lily.
Fruits were ripe for the gatherer, grain was falling under the
sickle. Bess, in a fair white muslin cap, a large check apron
over her dark chocolate-and-white-print gown (her blue bed-
gown days were over), was moving quietly about the house-
place, preparing their early breakfast, no longer restricted to
oatmeal porridge.
Tom, looking worn, but clean and neat as loving hands could
make him, leaned back in his soft arm-chair, and watched her
with well-satisﬁed eyes. Little Sim was already in the garden
with his grandfather, helping to gather raspberries and currants
for preserving.
The tall oak-cased clock struck seven, and then, true to
time, the guard’s bugle announced the coming of the coach
from Manchester. Instinctively Bess went to the door, as was
her wont, when the coach came in. She uttered an exclama-
tion of surprise.
“ Eh, Tum ! aw declare t’ coach is stoppin’ at ar gate.
Happen theer’s a parcel or summat for at Jabez.”
And off she set past the kitchen window and the farm-yard
Gothic doorway, and down the avenue, with the light foot of a
younger woman. Before she reached the avenue gate, the
stuffy vehicle had yielded up three ladies and two bandboxes,
and the guard having unlocked the capacious boot (a kind of
closet at the back), dragged thence, with much superﬂuous

pufﬁng and straining, two hair trunks of moderate dimensions.
Yes, there stood Mrs. Ashton, grandly calm ; bright-haired
Augusta, tall, slim, and, it must be added, unamiably silent;
and Ellen Chadwick, whose black eyes had an absolute glow of
expectancy in their depths. Bess put up her hand in amazement.
“ Eh, Mrs. Ashton, madam ! Yo’ han takken us unawares!
An’ theere is na a bit 0’ ﬂesh meat i’ th’ heause ; an’ th’
butcher’s cart wunna be reawnd agen till Setterday! But awm
downreet glad to see yo’ an’ th’ young ladies” (she dropped a
respectful curtsey, “ an’ a’ lookin’ so weel. Aw wur afeard yo’
wur no’ comin’ this Summer.”
“ Never mind the butcher’s meat, Mrs. Hulme ; having come
to Carr we must do as Carr does ; I do not doubt we shall fare
very well,” said the stately lady, reassuringly. “ I trust we
shall ﬁnd your good husband free from pain, and Mr. Clegg and
your family in health.”’
Bess thanked Mrs. Ashton for her kind inquiries, but some-
how she boggled over the “ Mr. Clegg.” She was proud enough
of his advancement, but to her he was still “Jabez ;” and he
did not seek to be otherwise.
There was a difﬁculty about the luggage, no men being about.
By this time old Simon was nearly down the hill, little Sim
following at his heels, his face, hands, and pianofore stained
with fruit.
“ I run for Joe,” cried crippled Sim, as Bess tried the weight
of a trunk, and Ellen interposed. Run indeed! It was the
very travestie of a run !
“Well, yo’ see as heaw 0’ Moore’s folk are eawt i’ th’ ﬁelds
cuttin’ whoats [oats]. Feyther an’ me con carry one on em
atween us. They’re no'zin so heavy.”
Mrs. Ashton would not hear of it. Just then little Sim came
back with Joe—his most particular friend, to whom he was
chief patron—a drivelling idiot, a man in frame, a child in
heart and brain. He was a pitiable object, the scoff of the
rabble, but he had sense enough to know his protectors. At
the instance of the four-years-old child, he shouldered the box
with a vacant chuckle ; and Sim, loaded with an oval pasteboard
bandbox half as big as himself, waddled after him as fast as hisv
deformity would permit.
Before the travellers could reach the top of the avenue Jabez
Cleg was with them, the other trunk upon his shoulder. He
had heard at the “White Hart ” of their arrival, and had almost
sacriﬁced the dignity of his position in his desire to run.

There were more greetings, accompanied by a cordial shaking
of hands; and Bess and Simon looked on with pleasure, not
unmixed with pain, that the foundling they had adopted and
reared had mounted far above their heads, albeit in rising he
had drawn them up too.
He breakfasted not with them in the house-place, but with
the new-comers in the parlour; and Bess herself waited upon
them, Meg, her little maid, being off in the harvest ﬁeld glean-
ing for a bed~ridden mother. -
She heard him conversing freely, if deferentially, with the
lofty Mrs. Ashton on topics and in a language her provincial
tongue could never compass. She saw him turn to answer the
arch sallies of Miss Ashton, and the quieter observations of
Miss Chadwick, and noted that the dark eyes of the latter
kindled when he spoke, and her cheeks had a warmer glow, as
if they caught their hue from the flushed face of Jabez.
Breakfast over—little Sim had sat on the door-step to share
his with Crazy Joe,—whilst Ellen and Augusta retired to un-
pack.' Mrs. Ashton graciously accepted the escort of Mr. Clegg
to the mill, and they trod the avenue and the high-road side by
side, discussing business matters, her dignity losing no whit by
the companionship. Mrs. Ashton was one of those who can
lift up without stooping.
Clouds never lingered on Augusta’s face ; she had been
transported thither, as she said, “ with no more ceremony than
a bale of twist,” but she put off her displeasure with her travel-
ling bonnet, and danced into the kitchen airily as a sylph, to
help Bess out of the quandary caused by their advent.
“I am afraid our arrival has been very inauspicious,”
Augusta said, “ but I can assure you I was not consulted, and
am not to blame” (she had certainly not been consulted—
blame was another matter). “ And now what can I do for you,
Mrs. Hulme P”
Augusta tucked up the sleeves of her peach-coloured gingham
dress, borrowed a linen apron from Bess, who confessed to
being “rayther a heavy hond at paste,” and soon the matron
was at ease respecting pies, and tarts, and custards. Simon
Clegg brought in a dish of trout fresh from the stream 3 the
larder supplied savoury ham and eggs, the garden furnished
peas ; so Mrs. Ashton was not far wrong.
It was but a spurt on Augusta’s part 3 her tender impression-
able heart had melted at Mrs. Hulme’s ﬁrst look of dismay, but,
the impulse over, there was no more tucking up of sleeves or

handling of paste pins. Fortunately for their digestion, Ellen
Chadwick had no less skill, since, quiet as she was, she seemed
to lack an outlet for superabundant energy, and, obtrusively
restless, helped Bess she hardly knew how, or how much.
Augusta wandered about cottage and garden, or sat for hours
under the shade of the great sycamore tree, singing low-voiced
plaintive ditties ; feeling herself the most ill-used and wretched
being in existence, separated from her adorable lover; and the
more she brooded, the more discontented and melancholy she
became. It was all very real and very much to be deplored.
No knife cuts so keenly at the heart-strings as the sharp edge of
a ﬁrst love turned in upon itself; and Augusta was as much in
love as ever was maiden of seventeen.
Mrs. Ashton went daily to the mill, but a casual remark of
Mrs. Hulme’s on “ Miss Ashton’s mopin’ an’ malancholy ”
aroused the attention of the energetic mother, and she did her
best to counteract morbid fancies with long sharp walks in the
early morning (extending, on one occasion, as far as Shawcross
Hall, where she astonished her relatives by an informal visit),
and a repetition of the dose in the evening, when Mr. Clegg
made one of the party, thus unconsciously adding fuel to the
ﬁres which, unknown to her, consumed alike her niece and her
warehouseman.
‘ At the end of ten days, Mrs. Ashton returned to Manches-
ter, leaving the girls behind. She had extorted a promise from
Augusta that she would not write to Mr. Laurence Aspinall,
and relied on that promise being faithfully kept. Moreover,
after some debate with herself, as they walked from the mill
together on the last afternoon of her stay, she committed her
daughter and niece to Jabez Clegg’s care.
“You are a very young man for so important a charge,” she
said, “but you are steady as old Time, and of your integrity
and ﬁdelity we have had many proofs. Miss Ashton’s health
demands a prolonged stay on this breezy hill‘side, but I fear she
feels it dull after Manchester. If you will endeavour to amuse
her when you see herdrooping, I shall consider myself your
debtor, sir ; and should anything unusual attract your notice, I
depend on your calling our attention to it.”
“ I feel honoured by the trust you repose in me, madam,”
replied he, a grave consciousness of his own danger stirring at
his heart ; you may depend on my watchfulness over Miss
Ashton and her cousin.”
But of any danger to Miss Ashton beyond that arising from

a sensitively delicate frame, which might need the sudden
summons of Dr. Hull to allay the fears of parents anxious for
their only child, he had no suspicion or perception. He had
no more clue to Mrs. Ashton’s hidden meaning than she to
his secret emotions. It had been wiser to have been more ex-
plicit. Without that charge he might have made it a point of
honour, if not of duty, to hold aloof from the young ladies
lest he should be obtrusive: as it was, the more he pondered,
the more he became satisﬁed that it was only a delicate way of
giving sanction to a companionship he might otherwise have
regarded as presumptuous.
Accordingly, he constituted himself their cavalier after busi-
ness hours, fulﬁlling to the letter his instructions to endeavour
to amuse Augusta whenever he found her drooping, well re-
warded if he could win back a smile or a peal of the rippling
laughter he had heard so oft in her school-girl days. His at-
tentions to Miss Chadwick were tinctured with the profoundest
respect, but there was no effort to entertain or be agreeable ; on
the contrary, it was Miss Chadwick who kept the light shafts of
her cousin’s wit within bounds when they were likely to wound
—as they did sometimes.
The White Hart, to Sim’s disquiet, would have suffered long
from dearth of herbage, had not thunderous clouds emptied
their reservoirs amongst the hills, until brooks became rivers,
and roads almost impassable. Then Jabez resumed his brush,
Sim clapped his thin little hands with delight, whilst the
sedate young lady of twenty-four, and the bewitching damsel
of sweet seventeen, varied the monotony of piano, book, or
embroidery-frame, with an occasional criticism of his work.
It was a time fraught with intoxicating delight, but of terrible
temptation to Jabez. The frequent ﬁts of langour which
bowed Augusta down like a drooping lily, made her only more
dangerously dear_to him, and it needed all his strength to re-
member that she was his master’s daughter, and conﬁded to
his care. If he now thought of Laurence Aspinall and his
fascination, it was only as a butterﬂy beau, for whom no sensi-
ble maiden could entertain a permanent liking. Not even
when, turning back one forenoon for something in the closet
which he had forgotten, he found her in tears on the low ledge
of the open window at the foot of the Staircase.
“ Good heaven, Miss Ashton, what is the matter? Are you
ill? Is anything troubling you P”
“ Nothing,” sobbed she, the clear drops falling faster.


## p. 253 (#265) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 2 5 3
“ Nothing! oh, Miss Ashton, this cannot be for nothing,”
and he sat down on the window-ledge beside her, not daring so
much as to touch her hand, his own were in such a quiver.
“ Miss Ashton—Augusta—you told me your troubles when
you were a school-girl, am I less worthy your conﬁdence now?
Can I do anything to serve you? I would lay my life down
to save you from pain ;” and the earnest tenderness of his
voice spoke volumes.
She had subdued her emotion. Gathering herself up with a
reﬂex of her mother’s stateliness, she said haughtily, “ It is no-
thing, sir, I am better,” and swept past him up the staircase,
leaving him to set his teeth and turn away with clenched hands,
alike exasperated at his own loss of self-command and grieved
for her grief.
On the narrow landing which ran parallel with the staircase
like a balcony, Augusta found her cousin Ellen, with one hand
on her side, leaning against the chamber door-post, as if for
support, with closed eyes and pale lips. She had been “ over-
come by the heat ”——so she said.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH.
THE LOVERS, WALK.
JABEZ held a responsible post, and had no more leisure
than other business men for emotional indulgence. He
hurried out of the cottage, and down the avenue, shutting up
his bitter feelings within the doors of his heart as he went. -.
But the process closed his eyes and ears to external sounds,
and the old postman, with his long tin horn, which had been
echoing through the straggling village a full quarter of an hour,
passed him in the avenue and said, “G00d-day,”, without so
much as arresting his attention.
At the mill he found letters waiting—one, which had been
i post-paid as a double letter, conspicuous amongst the wafered
business communications, not only because of its thick, gilt-
edged paper, and crimson disk of crested wax, but from its
curious folding, as if to bafﬂe prying eyes.
It was signed “ Ben Travis,” and was so long, it went into a
pantaloon pocket, to be read when his multifarious duties
allowed him more leisure.
When the hands were dismissed at noon, and the one clerk
had left the counting-house, he took out the voluminous
epistle, which was dated September roth, and certainly found
therein matter of interest. Amongst a few preliminary items
of news, he learned that the excesses of the Coronation night
had created so much disgust in the minds of thinking men
that many of those who had denounced Henry Hunt’s ad-
vocacy of abstinence, and at the public expense had formerly
disseminated printed laudations of good brown ale, the “ old
English beverage,” as “a cheering and strengthening drink,”
no longer branded the water-drinkers as “enemies to the
corporeal constitution of Englishmen,” but had given their
countenance to social gatherings whence intoxicating liquors
were exchided. Travis himself was doing what he could to

promote these temperate meetings, and looked for the earnest
co-operation of Mr. Clegg on his return to Manchester. (And
he did not look in vain ; though neither of the young social
reformers saw in advance how universal would become the
temperance movement of which this was the unpretending
precursor). '
The letter went on to say—
“Miss Chadwick and her fair cousin were spirited away
mysteriously. At ﬁrst I blamed myself as the unhappy cause
I have since discovered my mistake, through aquarrel between
Mr. Walmsley and Mr. Laurence Aspinall, when both were
slaves to Bacchus—[n vino verita: ./ I suppose you know that
Mr. Aspinall the elder is a martyr to the gout, and has been driven
by his enemy to the Buxton baths. The cause, I have heard,
was a gentlemanly debauch in a ﬁt of passion or wounded
pride. His son joins him today. I scarcely think he will
call on your young ladies after what has occurred.” '
“What has occurred?” repeated Jabez, “what can he
mean by that? I wish correspondents would be more ex-
plicit ! ”
He pondered over this sentence, but could make nothing of
it, and after reading a little way, came to the real object of the
letter, prefaced as it was with much circumlocution.
“It may seem strange that a great, big, burly fellow like
myself should be such a booby as to seek the intervention of
a third person in an affair of the heart. Yet, if I have any
insight into your nature, I think I may conﬁde in you, and
depend on your good ofﬁces. After so many months’ dangling
and craven hesitation, I summoned up courage to make my
pretensions known to Miss Chadwick. I know I did it
clumsily and ungracefully; the very strength of my passion
fettered my tongue. I shall never forget the pitiful look of the
sweet girl as she burst into tears, assured me of her esteem,
but declined my suit. Her tears unnerved me, and I had not
power to plead my own cause. Do not despise me, Clegg ;
neither Samson nor Hercules was any stronger. I cannot
resign myself to that verdict. I would throw myself again at
Ellen’s feet, and beseech her pity, but that I dread its repeti-
tion. Can Icount on your good ofﬁces to move her in my
behalf? I know the value Miss Chadwick sets on your
opinion, and how highly she esteems you, or I should not
think of asking this. The trust I repose in you is the best
proof I can give of friendship. Do not hesitate to tell me the

worst. I trust I am brave enough to bear my fate—when I
know it. Mrs. Chadwick does not believe her daughter’s de-
cision ﬁnal.”
This was a disquieting letter. Mr. Travis had been his ﬁrm,
true friend, in spite of difference in position and fortune. He
had overlooked that difference from the ﬁrst, but would Miss
Chadwick, his employer’s niece, overlook it, if he stepped
beyond privileged bounds P From the depths of his own con-
scious heart he felt for his friend, but how to approach so deli-
cate a subject to serve him was perplexing. He never thought
of shirking the trust.
It was late when he got home to dinner. Ellen and Bess
were both on the look-out for him. He quickened his pace,
fearing some evil to his beloved Augusta, whom he had last
seen 1n tears.
“What an anomaly is woman!” he thought, as he found
her ﬁngers rattling over the keys of her piano in accompani-
ment to the merriest ditty he had heard from her lips since she
was a child.
There was a strange sparkle in her eyes, a vivacity in her
manner so opposed to her sadness that he asked himself if he
had been dreaming before, or was dreaming then. She blushed
over her willow-pattern plate as she took her seat, but, after
that ﬁrst token of susceptibility, chatted with a volubility un-
usual to her, and curiously in contradiction to the silence and
reserve of Ellen Chadwick. In the morning he had debated
whether that secret trouble came within the category of “ un-
usual” things Mrs. Ashton required to be informed of, and,
behold ! it was gone !
She rallied both jabez and Ellen on their gravity, and at
length, as if on a sudden inspiration, asked, playing with her
green-handled, two~pronged fork—
“Shall you be very busy at the mill this afternoon, Mr.
Clegg? ”
It was an unusual question. He answered——
“ Rather. Some bales of twist have come in from Messrs.
Evans, of Darley-Abbey Mills. I must see them unpacked,
and compare the twist with samples. But—your motive for
asking?”
A“ Oh, if you are busy Well, perhaps after tea will be
better; it will be cooler. I wish you would just take Ellen a‘
good long walk 3 I found her fainting with the heat this
morning.” ~

r
Ellen coloured vividly.
“Augusta !” she remonstrated.
“And yourself, Miss Ashton?” questioned he.
“ Oh, I have a heap of clear-starching to do. My frills and
laces are in a woeful plight. I shall be clap-clap-clap all the
afternoon, and this sultry weather prohibits ironing until there
is a cool evening breeze to fan me through the window. With-
out it I should be as likely to faint as Ellen.”
Miss Chadwick made light of her faintness, and objected, if
not too strenuously, to be so disposed of; but Augusta, in her
old wilful way, insisted, and Jabez, with his friend’s letter on
his mind, was not likely to throw opposition in the way. So,
notwithstanding his recent rebuff, he was once more “Miss
Ashton’s humble servant to command.”
After an early tea, which was but a ﬁction to all three,
Augusta was left behind, busy with a box-iron and her lady-
like laundry of lace and muslin in the house~place, whilst
Ellen Chadwick and jabez went rambling with the winding
waters of the translucent Goyt, under umbrageous trees on
pleasant mountain slopes, where foxgloves nodded and horse-
tail grasses bent before them, and only an occasional reaper or
gleaner crossed their path.
Had these two been incipient lovers, no more embarrassing
silence could have fallen upon them. If jabez, her junior by
two years, had had a tussle to keep his love within bounds,
there had at least been a glimmer of hope in the distance, and
the struggle was upwards. Ellen had been trained from her
childhood to keep her naturally strong feelings under control ;
but there was a war in her breast between maidenly shame
and unsought, hopeless love, and the two hacked at each other
and at her heart in the rayless dark, and the struggle was
downwards.
Here she was, for the ﬁrst time, alone with the man she
loved with all the strength of a strong heart, with the newly-
gained knowledge that he “would die to save her cousin
pain ;” and he, conscious of a sacred and delicate mission, all
unaware of her secret love for himself, was perplexed how
best to approach the subject, and take advantage of the oppor_
tunity so afforded him. At length—
“ I had a letter from my friend, Captain Travis, to-day,” he
began.
With little perceptible emotion, she replied,
“ Indeed! I hope he was in good health. You are

honoured in your friendship, sir. Mr. Travis is a noble
gentleman, and I esteem him highly.”
This paved the way for him to expatiate on Ben Travis’s
many good qualities. He told the story of the big, raw-boned
youth’s ﬁrst patronage of himself, and found an attentive lis-
tener as he traced the growth of their friendship upwards,
and related favourable anecdotes which have no place in this
history. But no sooner did he begin to plead his friend’s
cause with all the warmth of young friendship, than her
manner entirely changed. Her colour came and went; she
panted as if for breath, and gasping out, “ Oh—h ! Mr. Clegg,
for mercy’s sake, don’t—don’t l” was seized with a sudden
faintness for the second time that day.
A lichen-covered old tree-trunk, shattered and uptorn in the
late thunder-storms, was at hand; he seated her upon it,
bringing water to revive her from a runnel near; but any
attempt to renew the subject only seemed to give her ex-
quisite pain, and he desisted on her telling him, in a suffo-
cating voice,
“ Honour forbids that I should listen to Mr. Travis 3 I—I—~
love another.”
Something in her tone or manner told him that her love
was as hopeless as his own for Augusta: and nothing could
be more respectful and gentle than his bearing towards her on
their homeward way, thus adding fuel to the ﬁre which con-
sumed her. '
The evening shadows were fast closing in when they reached
the cottage; and she, with a simple inclination of the head,
left Jabez on the threshold, and passing through the parlours,
carried her overmastering emotions upwards to her room, to be
grappled with in the silence of the night.
“Wheere’s Miss Ashton P” asked Bess. “Hoo said it wur
too hot to bide i’ th’ heawse an’ hoo put her irons deawn,
an’ after tittivatin’ hersel’ 00p a bit, went eawt a-seekin’ yo’.”
In some surprise, not unmixed with alarm, for the hour was
late—as times and country went—and the harvest brought
rough strangers into the neighbourhood, Jabez set off at full
speed down the avenue, and ere he had reached the ﬁrst
brook, saw her lithe ﬁgure advancing buoyantly ; and, if his
eyes and the gathering mist did not deceive him, a second
ﬁgure parted from her at the gate.
She was the ﬁrst to speak. “ Whichever way did you people
ramble off?”


## p. 259 (#271) ############################################

T ke Manchester Man. 259
“Oh, down by the Goyt, Taxal way, Miss Ashton,” an-
swered Jabez.
“Ah! and I went up the Buxton Road; we were certain
to miss.”
“I thought I saw you part from some one at the gate?
Could- I be mistaken?” half-questioned her interlocutor.
“Oh, Crazy Joe! that was all 1” and he took her reply in
all sincerity, not believing Augusta Ashton capable of untruth.
A day or two went by, during which Jabez wrote to tell Ben
Travis he “must arm himself with fortitude "—that “the
world was full of disappointments ”—that “Miss Chadwick
loved elsewhere”—but there was “something more for men
to do than die of disappointments or blighted love.”
And yet another day or two, during which Augusta’s moods
were as variable as the gusty shadows of the sycamore, changing
from wild exuberance which rallied Ellen on her depression,
and condescended to play or dance for Sim, to a moping,
moody melancholy, enlivened by frequent showers. She was
given to snatch up her hat and “run out into the garden for
a breath of fresh air,” but she generally came in panting, as if
the “run” had been literal; and sometimes she would be
found in the house when supposed out of it, and via versa.
The White Hart had not yet walked away, although Jabez
considered it complete. It waited Mr. Ashton’s coming and
his verdict, and stood on the easel in the dining-room.
The morning post had brought a message to Simon Clegg
concerning fruit and vegetables for the Manchester home, and
having sought him in the kitchen-garden to deliver it, Jabez
entered the house at dinner-time by the lower staircase window
(frequently used for entrance and exit). His passage through
the best parlour was arrested by voices in the room beyond,
one of which he knew too well. It was that of Laurence
Aspinall. His painting was evidently under free criticism, and
had been for some time. There was some jesting at the sign—
painter.
“ You see, Miss Ashton, what a few touches can affect l”
The speaker had apparently made free with Clegg’s colours
and brushes, and there was a murmured sound of assent from
Miss Ashton. '
“Well, Barret, ZVez wire far at 01121222: ; ZVe sutar ultra trepzl
dam. What say you P”
“ Yes ,- let the cobbler stick to his last. If this Clegg would
be an artist, let him stick to his brush; if a tradesman, let

him stick to his trade. If a man means to succeed, he must
never ﬂirt with either art or trade. It’s just as bad as wooing
two women at once.” ‘
Jabez heard no more. The blow which had been aimed at
his art-pretensions drove him back by the way he came, and
he paced the long terrace parallel with the “ Lovers’ Walk” for
fully half-an-hour. When he turned the corner of the cottage,
and went in at the front door, the critics were gone, but
Aspinall’s “ few touches ” remained. They had indeed given
life to the White Hart. Henceforth the “cobbler” resolved
to “ stick to his last.” .
Ellen Chadwick had been away, with little Sim by the hand.
to take some substantial comforts to Meg’s bedridden mother.
She appeared annoyed when she heard of their masculine
visitors from Buxton. Her evident displeasure set Jabez won-
dering what Travis meant by “after what has Occurred,” and
he wrote that afternoon for enlightenment, sending his letter
as a packet by coach, there being no second post.
It has been said that the cellarage of the cottage was only
accessible by ﬂights of steps in the portion of the weed-
grown Lovers’ Walk which lay at the windowless back of the
long low building, where nettles grew so thick and rank that
even the square unused trap over one set of steps was half
hidden by them. The path was rarely used, the farmer
having made a nearer cut from the farmyard to his ancient
dwelling. '
Torn Hulme was slowly recovering, under the care of a
Buxton doctor who came thrice a week. He could walk about
the garden with a stick, but there was no sending him to the
dank cellar for anything. The doctor had ordered him port
wine, and Bess, who kept the key, had asked Mr. Clegg to fetch
a couple of bottles from the cellar.
Tea was over, but he fancied there was sufﬁcient light to
guide him without a lantern. He had got the wine, and was
approaching the cellar door at the foot of the sunken steps
when he heard the sound of voices coming along the walk from
the direction of the moor.
Every pulse in his body seemed to grow still as be recognised
the tones of Augusta Ashton and Laurence Aspinall, and heard
with deepening anguish the unmistakable sound of kisses in-
terchanged. They had apparently paused close to the stair-
head for that embrace; and then he heard—and thanked God
that he was there to hear, though that hearing blighted every

hope he had—his rival, with every argument which passionate
love or skilful sophistry could employ, persuade her to elope
with him the following night. -
Backwards and forwards they walked in the gathering dusk,
but never beyond the length of the premises ; and now and then
they stopped, and drove him mad with their caresses. The
place was so retired and lonely, precaution was neglected ; and
Jabez, chained to the spot as it were, gathered that proposals
for her hand, made by Laurence himself, had been peremptorily
rejected by. Mr. Ashton, who was set down as a despot and a
tyrant for refusing to surrender a silly girl of seventeen to a rake
of two-and-twenty. He heard her tell that jabez Clegg had
found her sobbing at the separation, even whilst her darling’s
letter was at the gates. And he heard it said that the elder
Aspinall not only countenanced this secret courtship, but had
furnished funds for the proposed elopement. This generosity
was set against the cruelty of her own parents; her affection,
her pride, the romance in her nature were appealed to, but
still Augusta’s better angel held her safe, until, coward that he
was, Laurence terriﬁed her with a threat to “blow his brains
out ” if she refused him.
She wept her assent upon his breast, and then Jabez, already
half-stunned, heard the details of evidently previously concocted
arrangements for their elopement and marriage at Gretna Green,
professedly with his father’s sanction.

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH.
A RIDE ON A RAINY NIGHT.
ABEZ, bottles in hand, his mind a chaos, had walked in at
the wash-kitchen door precisely as Augusta, stealthily creep-
ing through a gap in the privet-hedge, made her way to the
convenient staircase-window, shivering more from fright than
from the chill driizling rain which had begun to fall. Putting
her head in at the parlour-door where Ellen was sewing, with a
brief “ I’m off to bed,” she hurried upstairs in the dusk to lave
her ﬂushed face, smooth her disordered hair, crush it under a.
night-cap, and place her head on a pillow, to still her heart’s
ﬂutterings under the screening counterpane, and hide her
emotions from her cousin under the semblance of sleep, though
sleep was an absolute impossibility.
In 1821 the village of Gretna Green, on the Scottish border,
wa_s the general resort of runaway lovers, who, being in their
minority, could not be married legally in England without
parental consent, whereas in Caledonia a mere promise to
marry made in the presence of witnesses was held binding.
At Gretna a man not in holy orders, but metaphorically called
“the blacksmith,” because he riveted the chains of matrimony,
lived in the ﬁrst house beyond the bridge which spanned the
river Sark, and, with a ceremonial as unseemly as it was brief,
married all comers, often with pursuers at his very doors ; and
the marriages so contracted were not to be set aside. For more
than half a century Gretna Green weddings had ﬁgur largely
in the literature of the stage and of the circulating library ; and
there is no doubt that the halo of romance thrown around an
elopement to Gretna blinded to the impropriety of the pre-
nuptial ﬂight many a foolish or headstrong girl whom the
actual ceremony shocked and startled.
Augusta Ashton, with all her sentimental romance, all her
petulent \iarjalfulness, all her resentment at being exiled from home

and her Adonis, yet loved her parents well, although her rever-
ence and ﬁlial obedience had been gradually undermined by the
plausible sophistry and impassioned eloquence of her ardent
lover. But if she loved them much, she, unfortunately, loved
Laurence more. He was, to do him justice, terribly in earnest;
and in the inexperience of her seventeen years she could not be
expected to sift and analyse that passionate earnestness for its
many components. With her all was love, and love was all.
His proposition had, nevertheless, come upon her with a
shock. She was not prepared to ignore the prudent teaching
of her mother, or to brave the indignation of her indulgent
father, or to forfeit her own self-respect, and nothing could
have moved her to consent but that appalling threat of suicide,
and he knew her tender heart well when he made it.
But neither that threat nor her promise could reconcile her
to the rash step, and she lay in bed shuddering with her own
fears, and strangely enough her ﬁrst thought was—“ What would
Jabez say if he knew it? ” Not her father, not her mother, but
the Jabez whom she had rebuffed only a week before, yet of
whose opinion she somehow stood more in awe than of all else
besides.
What did Jabez think, seeing that he did know? Think?
He scarcely could think. Feeling seemed to overpower thought,
reason, perception. When after a stagnant time he emerged
from the stair-head, it was more as a culprit than Jabez Clegg.
He put down the bottles and escaped again into the open air,
cowed alike by the knowledge which had overpowdered him,
and by a sense of dishonour at having played the unworthy
part of a listener, albeit the listening had been involuntary,
seeing that the shock of his discovery had stunned him like a
blow from a sledge-hammer, crushing his own long-cherished
hopes to death. His next thought was of intense thankfulness
that by any means the schemes of Aspinall had been bared to
him, and in time to attempt the rescue of his idolised Augusta
from the clutches of a villain.
Unacquainted with the events which had preceded Augusta’s
removal to Carr—unaware that the Mosley Street doors had
been closed against Laurence, or that a formal proposal for the
young lady’s hand had been made by the elder Aspinall on be-
half of his son, and peremptorily declined by the Ashtons ;
ignorant that 1‘mperious Mr. Aspinall, in his gouty wrath, had
sworn “ upon his honour” that his son slzould “ marry the girl
in spite of the paltry beggar’s-inkle-weaver,” and having no faith

\
in the man himself, Jabez regarded the use of the father’s name
only as a proof of his greater perﬁdy, and gave him no credit
even for an honourable intention or an honest emotion.\ The
time was past for Clegg to ﬁnd excuses for the wrong-doingﬁi
his adversary.
Now, with every nerve unstrung, he was required to act, am
that promptly. T o-morrow would be too late. What if he
should take Miss Chadwick into his conﬁdence? But no, he
could not lower Augusta in the eyes even of her own cousin ;
and neither she nor anyone there had authority to detain Miss
Ashton against her will even if her foot were on the step of the
post-chaise. It was imperative that he should reach Man-
chester immediately, yet how to do so without exciting alarm
perplexed him. There was a horse in the stable at the mill,
but as he had a bed in Simon’s room, and could neither leave
it nor return to it in the night without passing through the
Hulmes’ sleeping apartment, there was a difﬁculty in quitting
the house unknown.
“ I must be at the mill before daybreak to-morrow having
something of importance to attend to, so I will sleep on the
squab in the house-place, Mrs. Hulme, and if I am not in for
breakfast, do not wait for me,” said he ; and no one questioned
him, although Mrs. Hulme and her husband were of joint
opinion that “Jabez looked terribly put eawt,” and wondered
what business he could have on hand of so much consequence.
No one thought of locking country cottage doors. By nine
o’clock all the inmates were in bed and asleep. Before ten
Jabez, sad at heart, had quietly left the cottage for the mill, had
saddled Peveril, and, though no great horseman, was speeding
past the “White Hart ” along the highway to Manchester, fast
as the steady-going roadster would travel. The wind had risen,
‘ and the rain came down persistently ; but heedless of discom-
fort or danger, with the one thought paramount in his mind—
the preservation of his master’s daughter—he set his teeth and
rode on with a feverish impatience, which at length communi-
cated itself to Peveril, and quickened the beat of the sensible
animal’s hoof ; impatience which would have sent him ﬂying
over the toll-gates, had either he or his steed been equal to the
exploit, and which could barely brook the delay of drowsy toll-
keepers.
Nevertheless as he turned from Piccadilly into Mosley Street,
the muﬂled-up old watchman, catching the echoes of the Inﬁr-
mary clock, bawled out, to mark his own vigilance, “ Just one

o’clock, an’ a dark rainy neet!” and the Ashton household
had closed its eyelids, and its account with the day, at least a
couple of hours.
It is never pleasant to be the bearer of ill-tidings, so no
wonder Jabez hesitated with the lion-headed knocker in his
hand ere he sent its reverberations growling through the silent
house. His hesitation must have inﬂuenced the knocker, for
the lion had to roar again, and louder, before he heard the
window above unclose, and saw Mr. Ashton’s night-capped head
thrust out, to ask, in alarm, “Who’s there? What’s the matter?”
Jabez stepped back to the kerbstone to let the dull rays of
an oil lamp fall upon his face.
“ It is I, Jabez Clegg, sir; I have a matter of importance to
communicate.”
“ Good heavens, Clegg, you ! Surely the mill’s not been
burned down?”
“ No, sir, all’s right at the factory. There’s no harm done
anywhere at present. If you will please to come down, I hope
there may be time to prevent that which is threatened.”
“ Just so, I’ll be down directly.”
There were no lucifer-matches with which to precure instan-
taneous light, but during this brief colloquy, Mrs. Ashton had
been groping on the tall chimney-piece for their precursors the
Prometheans, and having found them, by dipping a small
chemically prepared match into a tiny bottle of ﬂuid, she ob-
tained a light as soon as the window was closed and the
draught shut out.
T 00 uneasy to waste much time in dressing, before many
minutes had ﬂown, Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, whose fears had
equally pointed to their daughter—the one in a roquelaire, and
the other in her warehouse overall—were both listening with
agitated and anxious faces to Mr. Clegg’s communication,
made with a discomposure great as their own.
“ Elope l” both parents exclaimed, simultaneously.
“Elope I” reiterated the mother! “our daughter consent to
elope, and with a reprobate like him? It is not possible 1”
“ So I should have said, madam, yesterday,” rejoined Jabez,
sadly, as he sank on a chair, overpowered more by the strain on
his feelings than by the fatigue of his long, wet, midnight ride;
“ and I would have given the war/d to have been able to doubt
the evidence of my own ears.”
Mrs. Ashton, with clasped hands up, sat opposite to Jabez ;
Mr. Ashton, lacking the consolation and inspiration of his

snuff-box, walked about the room with one hand to his head in
a state of distressing perturbation. He stopped in his walk to
ask, “ What’s to be done ?” as Jabez made this declaration, un-
conscious of its force. ,
The light of the chamber candle fell upon the haggard face
and drenched garments of the young man. The elder one
looked full at him, paused, then drawing near and laying his
right hand heavily on the other’s wet shoulder, asked in a
troubled voice, with an inquisitorial but not unkind manner-—
“ My lad, did no other motive than duty to your employers
bring you eighteen miles through the rain this dark night. to
save Miss Ashton from an imprudent marriage?”
Jabez had not stopped to analyse his own motives. Thus
questioned, it was not without embarrassment that he answered,
“ Mrs. Ashton desired me, sir, to watch over Miss Ashton, and
acquaint you with any matter affecting her welfare. But apart
from that, sir, I could not see Miss Ashton in the toils of a
libertine without an attempt to rescue her. I should have been
a dastard to sit passive ; and even now I feel we are losing
time.”
“Just so, just so,” assented Mr. Ashton. “ That reminds me,
Peveril is in the street, and you are soaked to the skin. My
dear ”—turning to his wife—“ will you arouse the servants, and
see that neither horse nor rider suffers in our service more than
we can help.”
Having thus get rid of his wife, of whom he stood some-
what in awe, he resumed his searching catechism of Jabez.
“And so, Clegg, you have no motive beyond a chivalrous
desire to save your master’s daughter, no interest to serve be-
yond your duty to us 9”
The ordeal was terrible. Jabez rose, his features working
convulsively.
“ Mr. Ashton, you are torturing me. Humble as I am, I
love Miss Ashton with my whole life and soul. But knowing
the distance between us, I have striven to keep the secret in
my own breast. And I protest I had no double ‘motive in my
journey hither.”
The genial small-ware manufacturer, to whom that night had
brought two revelations, looked Jabez steadfastly in the face as
he made his avowal ; then, taking him kindly by the hand,
said—his eyes swimming— '
“Just so, just so, my lad! I believe you. And, Jabez
Clegg, let me tell you that I would rather give my daughter

to an upright, persevering man like you, without a penny, than
to a spendthrift like Laurence Aspinall, though he rolled in
riches. But it’s no use saying that new.”
Indeed there was no use, and time was ﬂying. A glance
of grateful attachment, and a mute pressure of his liberal
master’s hand, were the sole acknowledgment of Jabez. But
a new bond was established between the twain.
Mrs. Ashton had come back to discuss with her husband
and Jabez the best mode of procedure. She was not less
shrewd than her lord, and had not failed to perceive that the
young man’s heart was in the service he now rendered them.
The blow dealt by Augusta to her pride dashed down the
impalpable barrier between them, and she took counsel with
him as a tried and true friend. >
Mr. Clegg pointed out the necessity for his return to the
mill before it should open, and he be missed; and taking a
proffered glass of brandy and water to avert cold, he hurried,
whilst hot coffee was preparing, to change his soaked gar-
ments preparatory to the ride back ; his elders also taking the
opportunity to dress and prepare for departure with the
morning coach.
Not a moment was wasted, but though Peveril had been
well groomed and fed, he was not so fresh to the road as he
had been; still the journey was homeward, the rain had
abated; day began to dawn as he left Stockport behind, and
without much use of the whip, Jabez had his horse back in
the stable before the factory bell began to ring. And then the
heart was allowed to rest. The jaded man had to rouse him-
self to another day’s work, another day’s trial and excitement,
without a moment for repose.
To everybody’s astonishment, Mr. and Mrs. Ashton stepped
out of the “ Lord Nelson ” coach that morning at the bottom
of the avenue, with a carpet-bag for luggage. The difference
of their reception by daughter and niece was palpable, and
they could not fail to observe how much the former was dis-
concerted by their arrival.
“ Oh, aunt and uncle, this is a pleasant surprise L” exclaimed
Ellen, running down the avenue to meet them.
“ You do not appear very well pleased to see us, Augusta,”
remarked Mrs. Ashton, as she met her lazily sauntering through
the garden towards them, as captivating in her printed morning
dress as a sleepless night, an anxious headache, and her unmis-
takable confusion would permit the recognised beauty to be.

“Oh, yes, I am pleased enough, but I should have been
better pleased if you had written instead of coming upon one
so suddenly. It is quite startling!” and the petulance of her
tone gave effect to the pettish frown on her brow.
“My dear, ill thoughts make ill looks,” said Mrs. Ashton,
gravely, with a searching glance. “What is the matter with
you this morning? Nothing serious, I hope."
The very inquiry apparently annoyed her.
“ Oh, I’ve got a headache, that’s all. I heard a man’s foot
on the gravel-walk long after everyone was in bed, and I got a
fright.”
“ I think it was only Crazy Joe—he hangs about at all
hours,” put in Ellen, who had not heard the crunch of Mr.
Clegg’s heel on the gravel, as he stood for a moment under
their window, to breathe a prayer for the safety and well-being
of the supposed sleeper, before he turned away swiftly on his
errand.
Almost Mr. Ashton’s ﬁrst inquiry was for Mr. Clegg.
“ He’s at the mill, sir. He was off afore any on us was up ;
an’ he said happen he mightna git whome fur breakfast, he wur
so busy,” was the reply of Bess. _
But Mr. Ashton, setting off towards the factory, encountered
Jabez on the way, and they returned together to breakfast, as
if they had met for the ﬁrst time that morning. On Mrs.
Ashton’s suggestion, Augusta was neither questioned nor accused.
“ We should only tempt her to deny, and perhaps provoke
ill-will towards our informant, with no good end,” she said.
“Better wait and ascertain beyond question what her inten-
tions are.”
Jabez would fain have spared her the pain and shame of
exposure, but the matter was out of his hands.
The day passed unmarked save by Augusta’s restless look-
out for Crazy Joe, and the way she hung about her mother, as-
if half afraid of the rash step she contemplated.
Mr. Ashton meanwhile, to cover his distress and agitation,
busied himself about the transfer of the White Hart (which he
pronounced “ admirable ”) to its place over the inn-door, and
managed to elicit from Chapman, the gossiping landlord, with-
out direct inquiry, that a ﬁne young spark in hunting gear had
put up his horse there several times within the past week, and
was like to make the fortune of Crazy Joe, he gave the po'or
softy so many half-crowns; but Joe was “deep, and never let
on what he got them for.”

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH.
DEFEATED.
JABEZ CLEGG and the young ladies occupied adjoining
chambers (the two inner rooms of the suite), but the
door of communication was locked, and they were attained by
different staircases. Thus, as he was compelled to pass through
the Hulmes’ sleeping apartment, so Ellen and Augusta were
constrained to go backwards and forwards through that of Mr.
and Mrs. Ashton—an arrangement to which long use had
probably reconciled them.
It was this fact which had so much disconcerted Augusta,
since she foresaw a difﬁculty in escaping unheard ,' and not
meeting with Joe (that most unpromising of Cupids), she was
as equally unable to convey a message to her expectant lover.
She repented her rash promise, and would fain have availed
herself of a pretext for delay ; but the night came, and,
haunted by imaginary pictures of Laurence with a pistol to his
head, she dared not disappoint him. She had promised to
meet him at that entrance of the Lovers’ Walk which opened
below Yeardsley-Hall Farm into Moor Lane, whilst, the lane
being a steep declivity, he was to keep the post-chaise in wait-
ing at the foot.
Her headache served as an excuse for retiring to bed earlier
than her cousin, and scarcely could her father and mother
restrain themselves as she kissed them lingeringly before she
went. Indeed, Mr. Ashton would much have preferred to
“ have it out with the girl at once, and have done with it,” there
not being much “waiting” blood in his veins.
He had kept out of her sight most of the day, ﬁdgeting over
one thing and another, whilst his waistcoat and shirt-frill bore
testimony to the constant raid on his snuff-box.
“I don’t like to see my poor lass trapped like a bird in a.
cage,” he said, in conﬁdence, to Jabez, whose opinion he

already knew agreed with his own, as did the desire to “thrash
the infernal scoundrel within an inch of his life.”
The last straw had broken the camel’s back, and Jabez was
no longer inclined to be passive.
Laurence had bid Augusta take no care for her wardrobe ,-
his purse was ample, and he would dress her like a queen if she
would only consent to ﬂy with him. So, after collecting a few
' immediate necessaries and trinkets, and placing the reticule
which contained them out of sight, she crept into bed, to lie
and listen for the household to follow her example. How lazily
the hours lagged! She heard old Simon shuﬂling about, and
the creaking of his camp-bedstead, as he settled his old rheu'
matic bones for the night, but the ﬁrm foot of Jabez she did not
hear, though the house clock struck nine, and Ellen came up
with the last stroke.
In answer to a question, Ellen said that Mr. Clegg was asleep
on the squab, and that she understood he had slept there the
previous night, to be able to go to the mill very early, without
disturbing anyone else.
“ I saw him as he lay there, where he had fallen asleep
shortly after tea, and I have been speaking to my uncle about
him ; he looks so dreadfully worn and jaded, I am sure he is
either killing himself with overwork, or has some great trouble
on his mind,” and a deep sigh followed this expression of
opinion.
Augusta was silent. Something within her secret heart
whispered that the trouble of Jabez Clegg would be intensiﬁed
sevenfold by her act of that night ,' and haughty as she was be-
times, she pitied him. And whatever were her compunctions,
fears, or emotions, Jabez certainly shared with her parents in
her thoughts. ‘
Ellen slept. The clock struck ten. Father and mother
entered their room, and through the door which Augusta had
artfully requested Ellen to “leave open on account of the heat”
came the sound of their voices in low 'but earnest converse—
“ You leave her to me, William,” spoken with decision, being
the only words she could distinguish, though she heard her
father walk about for some time. Indeed, she thought he would
never go to bed.
Eleven! She slipped stealthily from the side of her sleep-
ing cousin, and by the light of the moon, clear enough to-night,
dressed as noislessly and rapidly as her trepidation would
permit. From habit she knelt to pray, but as she came to the

passage, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil,” a new meaning seemed to ﬂash through the words, and
she half wavered in her purpose.
“ Poor Jabez ! ” she murmured to herself, as she caught up
her shoes and reticule, and listened in the open doorway for
the deep breathing which came from behind the dimity curtains
of the four-post bed. Re-assured, she stepped lightly across
the room in her stocking-feet, turned the drop-handle of that
chamber door as silently as the squeaking latch would permit
' and ﬂed swiftly down the stairs, sitting down at the bottom to
put on her shoes.
She had raised the sash, and was in the very act of stepping
over the low window-sill, when a foot was heard on the stair,
and turning her head, she saw her mother fully dressed close
by her side, and felt her slight wrist grasped as in a vice.
“ Is this your ﬁlial love and obedience, misguided girl? Is
this the result of Madame Broadbent’s training P Have you
no more sense of honour and decency than to elope at mid-
night with any man, least of all with the worthless reprobate
who has caught your silly fancy? Could you not think that
chastity is the brightest jewel in a woman’s crown, and the
soonest dimmed, that you were ready to leave your character
at the mercy of every gossip who had a tongue to wag P ”
She had drawn Augusta, too much stunned to speak, into the
parlour close at hand, and had shut the doors—a needless pre-
caution, seeing how remote were all sleepers. A few words of
gentle motherly inquiry might have softened impulsive, tender-
hearted Augusta to tears, and turned the whole current of her
life ; but Mrs. Ashton’s stateliness had become sternness, and,
fresh from the evil teaching of Laurence Aspinall, her daughter’s
proud spirit rose in rebellion, and answered her.
“We are going to be married. And I was not going with
Laurence alone. Cicily was to travel with us. Laurence him-
self proposed it.” '
“ Infatuated girl!” exclaimed Mrs. Ashton, “Cicily was in
Mosley Street last night.”
“And so were you, mother,” was the smart retort, “but the
coach which dropped you here carried her to Buxton. Out-
side passengers were mufﬂed up, but she waved her handker-
chief as she passed, as a sign to me.”
“Sign to you, indeed! I marvel you are not ashamed of
yourself and your hero, who is not content W1th corrupting my
daughter, but must corrupt our servants also ! A ﬁne hero in-

deed, whose qualiﬁcations are all external ! I cannot see what
there is to admire in him.”
“ Not see what there is to admire in that exquisite ﬁgure and
beautiful face? Why, I shall be the envy of half the girls in
Manchester when I marry him 1 ” Augusta exclaimed, with any-
thing but the air of a culprit just detected.
“ But you are not likely to marry him, you forward chit.
You go back to Manchester to-morrow, and I will take good
care you don’t marry either clandestiner or openly a man so
sure to make your heart ache, if he were thrice as hand-
some ! ”
“But I WILL marry him, mamma—l’ll please my eye, g'f I
plague my heart ./ ”
“ T hen, as you make your bed, so must you lie, mz'ss,”
answered Mrs. Ashton, gravely and deliberately. “ But take
my word for it, neither your papa nor myself will give our con-
sent. And now go to your room, Augusta, and thank God you
have been saved from disgrace this night, and thank us that we
have kept you from open exposure. Not even your cousin has
a notion of this last folly. Our daughter’s honour is dearer to
us than to herself,” and the mother’s tone softened as she
spoke.
“Your daughter’s honour has never been in any danger,”
said Augusta, haughtily, as she swept from the room, to
encounter at the foot of the stairs, flooded by moonlight
through the open window, her father—and Jabez.
Up to that moment she had stood on the defensive, her way-
ward spirit upholding and arming her for retort. The sight of
the father who had indulged her every whim, and of jabez
whose esteem she valued more than she herself knew, gave a
sudden shock to her overwrought nerves, and she fell forward
into the arms of Jabez in a deep swoon.
Tenderly, respectfully, sadly, he bore her into the parlour,
and placing her on the sofa, relinquished her to her mother,
divesting himself of his shoes in order to procure water to
restore her without creating alarm. _
When she recovered he was gone; she was alone with the
parents whose counsels she had despised, whose love she had
wounded ; herself detected and humiliated.
A greater humiliation had fallen to the lot of elate, en-
amoured, and self-satisﬁed Laurence Aspinall, when, leaving
his friend Barret with the post-chaise, their saddle-horses, and
Cicily at the bottom of Moor Lane, he mounted the hill and

whistled softly at the entrance of the Lovers’ Walk, to call forth
——not a blushing maiden, half afraid of her own temerity, but
—two justly incensed and indignant men. His low-voiced
“Augusta ” died upon his lips ; he recoiled, stammered-—
“ You ! I—I did not expect D—nation ! What brought
you here P I thought—_”
“ Just so, you atrocious scoundrel, you thought God had left
our pet lamb to the fangs of the wolf, and that neither father
nor friend was near to protect the innocent l ” exclaimed Mr.
Ashton, raising the stout bamboo with which he was provided.
“If that infernal Cicily has betrayed us, I’ll ”
The threat was not completed, for Jabez interrupted him
with—
“No, sir, it was not Cicily. You betrayed yourself. You
laid bare your whole scheme in this walk within my hearing,
Mr. Laurence Aspinall, and the sophistry which misled a simple
conﬁding girl could not delude one who knew you as I do.”
“ D—nation l” hissed Laurence between his teeth. “You
infernal charity-school whelp! Am I to meet you at every
turn? I suppose you want Miss Ashton for yourself, but I’ll
balk you yet ! ” and, but that Jabez had a quick eye and hand,
his riding-whip would have seamed the latter’s manly face.
Jabez dexterously caught the light whip, and wrenched it
from him, a simultaneous sharp blow of Mr. Ashton’s bamboo
on Aspinall’s shoulders tending to loosen his grasp. And then
the two young men, with all the fever of jealousy added to old
animosity, closed and grappled with each other as might a lion
and a tiger in the arena. And Mr. Ashton, his love of fair
play yielding to his exasperation, made good use of his bamboo
whenever he could deal a blow without harming Jabez.
The two combatants were not unequally matched ,' there was
little difference in size and weight, but the scientiﬁc skill of
Laurence had more than a counterpoise in the nerve and
muscle of Jabez, strengthened by exercise and a temperate life,
whilst vicious courses had somewhat impaired his own athletic
frame.
The struggle on the steep hill-side was too deadly for noise.
At length Laurence—himself booted and spurred—in striving
to take an unfair advantage and rip the unprotected calves of.
Jabez with the rowels of his spurs, lost his foothold, and was
borne to the earth, falling heavily. He lay on the ground
stunned and motionless. At once Jabez, with a swift revulsion,
of feeling, knelt down by the side of his prostrate foe, and
T

raised his head; Mr. Ashton bending over them inquiringly,
just as Barret, whom curiosity and impatience had drawn from
his post below, came on the scene. A stiﬂed groan, and a
muttered curse, having assured Clegg that his rival was not
mortally injured, he called to Barret——
“Here, sir, take charge of your worthy principal; and be
careful, when next you plan an elopement, that you have not a
man to deal with instead of a credulous gir .”
Mr. Ashton’s “Just so !” coming sharply in as chorus, the
young man put his arm in that of the elder and drew him
away, leaving Barrett and the postilion to restore Laurence
Aspinall, and assist him into the post-chaise by the side of
Cicily—whose trepidation would have been very much in-
creased could she have seen how the blood was trickling down
from a wound in his head, staining still more the torn, miry
coat, and the disordered shirt-frill over which he was usually so
fastidious.
" Barret, leading his companion’s horse, rode on in advance
of the vehicle, to prepare the pompous gentleman, laid up with
the gout in Buxton Crescent, for the reception of his gentle-
manly son in a highly gentlemanlike condition—hatless,
wigless, dirty, dilapidated, bruised, bloody—and unsuccessful.
The hat had rolled down-hill, to be crushed under the wheels
of the chaise; the wig and broken whip were found the next
morning by Crazy Joe, who exercised his witless head respect-
ing them and the trampled ground to small purpose; then
brought them to his friend Sim as playthings. Had they
fallen into the hands of a reasoning mortal, much more per-
plexity, and a very serious mystery, might have been the
result.
Buxton being only ﬁve miles from Whaley-Bridge, Barret
again made his appearance in the neighbourhood of the
“White Hart,” whilst the new sign still attracted rustic ad-
mirers ; and, ﬁnding no rumours current respecting the
occurrence of the preceding night, he rode off again, having
ﬁrst committed to Crazy joe a scarcely decipherable missive
from the discomﬁted lover to the not less discons'olate damsel.
The evening coach bore the Ashtons and Ellen back to
Manchester; Augusta, still in a rebellious mood, the cause of
which, being hidden from her cousin, occasioned the latter no
little perplexity. There was something, too, in the manner of
her uncle and aunt to Jabez, and of Jabez to all, which, being un-
deﬁnable and impalpable, struck her as peculiar. He seemed

suddenly to have risen to another footing. How was it they
had taken him into their conﬁdence ?
Not until the last moment—when attention was distracted
by the bustle at the inn-door, the disposal of the luggage, and
the taking of seats——could Crazy Joe (with cunning worthy a
better cause) contrive to slip the billet-doux into Miss Ashton’s
reticule, unseen by all but herself.
Not until she reached her own room could she scan its
characteristic contents, which ran as follows :—
“ Crescent, Buxton,
' “ September ——--, 1821.
“ADQRED AUGUSTA,

CHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH.
LIKE FATHER, LIKE son.
T is no uncommon thing for a woman to gild a block,
wreathe it with ﬂowers, and then fall down and worship
the idol she has adorned. Augusta’s hero needed no outward
embellishment, so she ﬁtted the fair exterior with the perfec-
tions and virtues of the high-spirited, noble, generous
Mortimers and Mowbrays, whose acquaintance she had made
in print, and had set him on a very elevated pedestal, in spite
of all warnings. With that misleading letter of his before her,
no wonder if the “ blood shed for her sweet sake ” converted
the hero into the martyr, and placed Jabez and her father in the
category of cruel persecutors. It did more. It erected a
barrier against reconciliation. In vain her placable father held
out a ﬂag of truce; she kept aloof resentfully, though in the
solitude of her own chamber she gave way, and wept at her
isolation from all who loved her.
Mrs. Ashton, whose sense of propriety had been outraged,
whose maternal pride had received a terrible shock, was less
readily disposed to condone her daughter’s offence ,' and, being
a better business woman than a psychologist, her tactics showed
none of her ordinary shrewdness.
The failure of Augusta’s banishment to Carr should have
taught her that romance is nursed in solitude, and that con-
ciliation is better than coercion. Had she spared a few hours
from the warehouse to arrange a dance, or a gipsy-party to
Dunham Park; chaperoned her lovely daughter to assembly,
theatre, or concert-room ; invited her companionship in astroll
through St. Ann’s Square and King Street, calling at Mrs.
Edge’s fashionably-frequented library by the way ,' joined the
after-morning-church promenaders in the Inﬁrmary Gardens,
or given a little time to morning calls, she would havesbrought

Augusta into contact with young people of her own age, and
with the attractive of the opposite sex, and so have supplied
an antidote for the poison Laurence and ultra-sentimental
literature had instilled.
Instead, never was the golden fruit of the Hesperides more
vigilantly guarded. She was kept much within doors. The
modern notion that a daily airing is indispensable had not been
promulgated, or had not become the creed of the manufactur-
ing community. Mrs. Ashton had “ no leisure for gadding,”
and Augusta cared little to drive in the gig with only James
for her charioteer, or even to walk with Ellen, so long as the
mulberry-coloured livery was in attendance. (It might have
been otherwise, had not the said James held it as much
“beneath his dignity ” to accept a bribe as he had formerly
done to wait upon Mr. Clegg.) From her old bed-room,
which overlooked Mosley Street, she was relegated to one in
the rear, which commanded no wider prospect than their own
courtyard, nor anything more interesting than Nelson and his
kennel—by-the-bye, Nelson had been in favour since the sad
accident on the ice. Then, visits to Marsden Square were
prohibited, lest she should there meet John Walmsley’s unde-
sirable friend; and altogether her escapade had converted
home into a cage, in spite of its gilding.
As might have been expected, the high-spirited, wayward
girl, so long her father’s pet, so long indulged, in her caprices,
chafed and rebelled against every fresh token of restraint, and
contrasted the dull monotony of her life with the freedom, and
gaiety promised so frequently by Laurence as the certain con-
comitants of wifehood with him.
With all her haughty spirit, she had a clinging, affectionate
nature, tinged though it was with poetry and romance ,' and now
that her father looked so unusually grave, and her mother so
frigid, and she felt herself an alien from both their hearts, in-
stead of bewailing her premeditated ﬂight as a crime, the
tendrils of her love only clung closer to him who professed so
much, and the more she was isolated from them, the more she
brooded on the ill-used and maligned Laurence, his manly
beauty and accomplishments, his lavish generosity, his fascina-
tions of voice and manner, and the fervour of his passion
for her.
Meanwhile, Tom Hulme had resumed his duties at Whaley-
Bridge Mill, and Jabez returned home to his. Much to Augusta’s
surprise, he vwas not only invited to dine with them on the day

of his return, but to take his place henceforth at their board as
one of the family.
With Laurence’s misrepresentations ﬁxed in her mind as
truths, she construed the daily association thus thrust upon her
as a deliberate affront, and resented it with a silent scorn which
cut Jabez to the soul. He knew nothing of Aspinall’s letter,
or that he was accused of a “ruﬁianly attack,” he only felt
that he would have died to serve her, and had done what he
had to save her from life-long misery without a single thought
of keeping her for himself.
A few more days, and back to Manchester came Mr. Aspinall
senior, having left a little of his portliness with his gout in the
Buxton Baths. Back with him came his son, and his son’s
congenial companion, Mr. Edmund Barret ; the former still
smarting under his defeat at Carr, and all the more resolutely
determined to carry off Augusta, jealousy adding a new element
to his love, a new aliment to his hate.
Sitting idly by the parlour window on the third of October,
with her head leaning against the frame, meditating on her own
unhappiness and her parents’ harshness, Augusta suddenly
started to her feet with a suppressed cry of delight, a vivid glow
upon her cheeks, a brilliant sparkle in her eye. Laurence
Aspinall, mounted on Black Ralph, his favourite hunter, was
riding up the street, the dislocated ankle apparently not affecting
his enjoyment of equestrian exercise. As he raised his new
beaver in graceful salutation, even the ﬂutter into which she was
thrown could not prevent her missing his glorious curls. He had
not deemed it necessary to replace his wig, and the poll shorn
during fever had not yet grown a fresh crop ripe for harvest.
The unfavourable impression passed with the moment, as he
brought his obedient steed on the ﬂagged pavement close
under the window, and without a moment’s hesitation, she
raised the sash, and leaned forward to speak with him, glad of
the opportunity.
“ Oh, Laurence l”
“My own Augusta, this is indeed fortunate l”
Their hands clasped upon the window-sill,-—.—the elevation of
the house raising her to his level—her tearful eyes looked up in
his for traces of suffering after the “ rufﬁanly attack,” and found
there, mingled with the ﬁerce light of violent love, a bitter sense
of defeat, a resolve to obtain her by fair means or foul.
Each had the separate experience of that memorable Septem-
ber night to relate,» coloured as passion or prejudice prevailed ;

but neither could fully enlighten the other as to the share Mr.
Clegg had had in preventing the elopement.
He could tell her that Jabez had avowed overbearing their
conversation in the Lovers’ Walk, though where he could have
been to overhear, or what strange fatality could bring Mr. and
Mrs. Ashton to Carr in time to become the recipients of his
eavesdropping and defeat their plans, was a puzzle to both.
Be sure Laurence put the worst colour on the encounter in
the lane, and urged all he had himself endured to strengthen
his claims upon her—claims she was quite willing to admit, had
she the power to concede to them.
Having shown with very evident annoyance how impossible
it was for her to meet or give him a private interview, he ex-
claimed with indignation—-
“ What ! not allowed to visit a relative, or to go abroad with-
out a gaoler ! My dearest Augusta, this is a cruel state of cap-
tivity. But my bird must not be allowed to fray her beautiful
plumage in beating against the bars of her cage. I must devise
a better plan for her escape. Any means are justiﬁable to
obtain release from tyranny like this. What says my love ? Is
she still,willing to trust her Laurence P”
“ T 0 the death l” she whispered, emphatically.
“ You are alone here every morning?”
Her lips could barely frame a “ Yes,” when a voice and step
in the hall warned her to close the window with a hurried
gesture to him ; and before Mrs. Ashton, who had lingered to
give an order to James, could enter the room, Black Ralph was
cantering towards the Portico, and Augusta occupied with the
third volume of “Alinda, or the Child of Mystery.”
Very little escaped Mrs. Ashton’s eye. The clatter of hoofs
on the ﬂags, audible through the thick front door, had left no
sensible impression on her brain, but the heightened colour of
Augusta attracted her attention at once. She brought her work-
basket from the panel-cupboard, took thence a strip of cambric
muslin, and handed it to her daughter.
“ My dear,” said she, quietly, “‘all play makes no hay.’
Your eyes are younger than mine, and I think it will do you
more good to hem your father’s shirt-frills than to pore over
sentimental books from morning until night. So much
romance-reading is not good for you. I see that you are quite
ﬂushed and excited over the one you are perusing now.”
There was a shart rat-tat on the lion’s head, and in burst Mr.
Ashton, much more ﬂushed and excited than his daughter. He

had met Mr. Laurence on Black Ralph just as he was quitting
the Portico, after an angry discussion with Mr. Aspinall the
elder. »
“You are quite right, my dear, in saying, ‘ Like father, like
son,’” cried he, “ for I’ll swallow my snuff-box if that pompous
old cotton-merchant did not justify his scapegrace son in his
attempt to carry off our Augusta ! He said that ‘the end
justiﬁed the means,’ that we ‘ought to be proud of such an
alliance "’—Mrs. Ashton’s lip curled—“that ‘he was glad Miss
Ashton had more discernment than her parent,’ that ‘ his boy
had set his heart upon her, and should not be thwarted in his
choice by any beggar’s-inkle-weaver in England.’ And no
sooner had I left him in the reading-room, to digest my opinion
on the subject, and put my foot on the steps of the Portico,
than up rode young Hopeful, and took off his hat to me, bow-
ing down to his black’s horse’s mane.”
Having delivered himself of this explosive intelligence, Mr.
Ashton walked about, and sought a sedative in his snuff-box;
and Augusta, who, folding the hem of the frill, had not lost
one word, said, drily,
“ I think Mr. Aspinall’s justiﬁcation of his son’s design may
at least be taken as a vindication of Mr. Laurence’s honourable
intentions, of which so many doubts have been expressed. And
the bow equally absolves Laurence from a charge of malice.”
With a proud toss of her shapely head, she walked towards
the dining-room, rejecting the proffered arm of Jabez, who
had entered the parlour whilst Mr. Ashton was speaking, and
thus closed a discussion which could not be continued in the
presence of servants.

Jabez, on his return from Carr, had found his rough old
clerical friend conﬁned to his room seriously ill. Tabitha was
worn out with his humours and eccentricities, and was glad
when the young man offered to relieve her twice or thrice a
week,- and old Joshua welcomed him as a relief from the
monotonous garrulity of an unlettered old woman. Jabez
could bring him news of another stamp. Through Ben Travis
(who had discovered that activity was the best antidote to
melancholy), he kept him informed of the progress of the in-
cipient temperance movement, in which the Parson took
uncommon interest; through Mr. Ashton, he kept him an
couram‘ of town politics, and for general intelligence he brought

newspapers with him to read interrupted by many and
unique commentaries. In order that Tabitha might obtain
repose, Mr. Clegg usually remained until a late hour, Mrs.
Ashton herself entrusting him with a latch-key on these occa-
sions.
One night, towards the middle of October, when Joshua had
been more than ordinarily crusty, and Jabez did not quit the
classic corner until the “wee short hour ayont the twal,” he
was struck as he turned the corner from Market Street into
Mosley Street to ﬁnd Mr. Aspinall’s carriage in waiting with
four horses and postilions.
He stood still for a moment to re-assure himself, but car-
riages were not so common that he should mistake that par-
ticular one ; and his heart drummed an alarm within his breast.
Hurrying on with sad misgivings, he passed two tall ﬁgures
muﬂled in cloaks, whom he had no difﬁculty in recognising,
from build and walk, to be the Aspinalls, father and son ,- and
increasing his speed he gained the door, inserted his key in
the latch, and was on the stairs before the cloaked individuals
had ﬁnished their speculations respecting his being a robber
escaped from a constable.
Formerly, Augusta had to pass his room door to reach her
own, on the opposite side of the long corridor. Her new
chamber was next to his own, and nearer to the staircase. A
thin stream of light shot through the key-hole, and a bright
narrow line cast upon the opposite wall showed the door ajar.
He stood still in his surprise.
As if a tipsy, musically-disposed man were going past, the
refrain of a rollicking song was trolled out in the street ; and
then Augusta, equipped as for a journey, came forth from her
chamber to descend the stairs. She had calculated on the
signal an hour earlier, and expected Jabez an hour later. As
she stole on tiptoe down the stairs Jabez confronted her and
barred her progress. Her silver candlestick dropped from her
hand, with the one word “Again!” and rolling down with a
clang, awakened Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, the only sleepers on
that floor, and set Nelson barking furiously. They were in the
dark, but he had caught her hand.
“ Miss Ashton, this is infatuation—madness.”
“ No matter, sir, let me pass ; you have no right to detain me E”
“But I have, miss,” said her father coming behind, guided
by their voices, his scant apparel as invisible in the gloom as
himself. “Is this another attempt to disgrace us by eloping?

Oh, my child, my child, you are breaking your poor old father’s
heart !”
“ And mine I” ﬂoated like the echo of despair’s last sigh
from the lips of Jabez.
But the utter hopelessness of the old man’s tone touched a
sensitive chord of Augusta’s soul, and turning, she fell upon
his neck crying tearfully, “ Oh, forgive me, father, forgive me.
I did not think you would take it so much to heart.”
_ The appeal of affection to affection had accomplished what
reason and authority had failed to effect.

CHAPTER THE FORTIETH.
WITH ALL HIS FAULTS.
UGUSTA’S penitence exhaled like dew from a flower.
In the light of her mother’s lofty displeasure her tears
dried, and self-will once more exerted its pre-eminence. She
locked herself in her own room and resolutely refused to come
forth.
“So long as that odious meddler, Jabez Clegg, remains
under our roof, I will stay here; and, if you will not consent
to my marriage with Laurence Aspinall, I will starve myself to
death l” was her angry declaration, as she closed the door and
turned the key.
“Leave her alone,” said Mrs. Ashton, “she will want her
food before the food wants her; and a little wholesome soli-
tude is good for reﬂection. She will change her mind before
the day closes.”
This was at mid-day; but night came, and another noon,
yet there was no sign of Miss Ashton’s appearance ; and Mrs.
Ashton had made no overtures to her refractory daughter.
The tender-hearted father was in a pitiable state of perturba-
tion. In and out the warehouse he was twenty times in the
day—as Kezia observed, “ For a’ th’ world like a hen on a hot
griddle,” and his snuﬁ'~box was hardly ever out of his hand.
Business seemed altogether beyond his grasp ; he answered
questions at random, or was unconscious when addressed.
To this state of trouble Jabez unintentionally contributed
his quota. Over the tea~table, unenlivened by Augusta’s
sparkling presence, though she was the one sole topic of con-
versation—he said, and not without an effort—
“ It has occurred to me, and I have thought the matter
Well over, that since my unfortunate position in relation to
late events has made my very presence obnoxious to Miss
Ashton, assit might be better for all concerned if I were to shift

my quarters without delay. There are lodgings vacant close
vat hand; and I have no right to linger here and disturb the
peace of any one member 'of your kind family.”
“Jabez Clegg l” remonstrated Mr. Ashton, with wide-open
eyes.
“ Have you any other reason to be dissatisﬁed with present
arrangements ?” asked Mrs. Ashton stifﬁy.
“ Oh ! Mrs. Ashton, how can I have P This house has been
my home for years, and such a home as rarely falls to the lot of
the fatherless. To you, my benefactors, I owe everything—
almost myself; and I should ill repay your uniform kindness by
remaining to create discord.”
“If your only desire to remove is to gratify Miss Ashton’s
whims, you will oblige me, Mr. Clegg, by remaining,” replied
Mrs. Ashton, with grave decision ; whilst Mr. Ashton, looking
the very picture of consternation, laid his hand uponthe young
man’s sleeve, and said slowly—~-
“My lad, you have been one of the household for many
years ; do not be the ﬁrst to make a breach in the family. If
the child of our blood and our affections goes forth to strangers
wilfully, and repudiates us, do not let the son of our adoption
leave us to lament her loss in solitude.”
This was strong language, but Mrs. Ashton did not gainsay
it, and Mr. Clegg could not longer press the point though his
own pain was intensiﬁed by the fear of adding to the distress of
Augusta, who, he was conﬁdent, regarded him as an interloper
and a mischief-maker.
Little had been seen of Ellen since the return from Carr
Cottage. A message despatched by Mrs. Ashton to her sister,
in her dilemma, was answered by another to pray them to “ ex-
cuse Miss Chadwick, who was not well enough to go out.”
, This somewhat disconcerted Mrs. Ashton, who, more
alarmed than she would admit, and disturbed by the restless
uneasiness of her husband, had looked for Ellen to act as a
mediator without any compromise of her own dignity.
At the close of the second day, as Augusta pertinaciously
refused to open the door, at the instance of Jabez the lock was
forced. ; and even then a barrier of chairs and boxes had to be
thrust back by sheer strength. She was exhausted from want
of food, but her will was indomitable, and neither her father’s
entreaties, nor her mother’s commands could induce her to
partake of the viands spread before her.
Jabez was in agony. Delicacy and her obvious dislike had

The Manchester Man: 285
kept him from intruding upon her privacy, but as hour after
hour was added to the night, and Augusta persistently dashed
aside the food placed to her lips, he joined his prayers to those
of her father,- and neither availing, rushed out of the house,
and in less than a quarter of an hour returned with Dr. Hull.
He was not a man to stand any nonsense.
“ Here, sir ”—to Jabez—“ you are young and strong, hold
the silly child’s arms whilst her teeth are forced apart. If she
will not take food, she shall take physic, and see which she
likes the best.”
But the struggle to nourish her frame through set teeth was
prolonged and painful, and the parents were likely to yield be-
fore the child.
Servants may be faithful, but they have eyes and ears, and
not always discreet tongues. Family matters discussed freely
in the kitchen before apprentices, found their way into the
warehouse and beyond it, and Mrs. Ashton’s nerves tingled
when she became acquainted with the rumours aﬂoat.
From Tim, the Ashton stable-boy, Aspinall’s emissary (Bob
the groom, once more in his old service) had no difﬁculty in ‘
obtaining all the information his young master needed.
Laurence waylaid Mr. Ashton, inquired anxiously after the
obstinate girl’s health, and, having paved the way by as much
contrition as he thought necessary, called at the house the
following morning, in company with his father, to renew pro-
posals for Miss Ashton’s hand.
Worn out by Augusta’s obstinacy, which she and Laurence
agreed to call “ constancy,” father and mother were in a
different frame of mind to receive this proposition than when
they had given their former peremptory rejection. They were
not one whit more convinced by Mr. Laurence’s assurance that
he meant to “ reform,” or Mr. Aspinall’s quotation of the
adage, “ A reformed rake makes the best husband” ,' but rather
than see their child starve herself to death before their very
eyes, they yielded; and Laurence Aspinall, profuse alike in
thanks and professions, was permitted by aching hearts and
reluctant lips to introduce Augusta to his father then and there
as his bride elect.
It was a moment of triumph for Laurence when Augusta
refused to come down without an assurance under his own hand.
He pencilled on a card, “ My Augusta, I wait for you,——Lau-
rence.” And presently, supported by a maid-servant, she
entered the room, her dress of purple poplin serving to show

how wan and transparent her fair skin had grown, how unnatural
was the brilliance of her eyes.
‘ She would have fallen, as much from weakness as ernotion,
on her entrance into the parlour, but that Laurence darted
forward and caught her in an embrace which brought back
somewhat of her lost colour; and if anything could have
softened the pain of that hour to her parents, it was the appa~
rent ardour and sincerity of the lover, the hope that a genuine
passion might tend to wean him from his old habits and
associates. \
Mr. Aspinall’s reception of Augusta was characteristic.
“My charming Miss Ashton, I see my son has brought back
the roses to your cheeks. May they never fade again, but
bloom perennially without a thorn ! I rejoice to kiss your hand
aternally on this auspicious occasion, and to assure you that I
shall be proud to welcome such beauty and such constancy as
the wife of my noble son.”
Consent once obtained, the Aspinalls Were as eager to press
forward the marriage as the Ashtons were to retard it, neither
her father nor mother affecting a satisfaction they did not feel.
“My dear,” said the latter to Augusta one day, when her
eyes were sparkling over a costly present just received from
Laurence, “ your father was in hopes you would have ﬁxed
your heart on some good steady man like Jabez Clegg, who
would have been a comfort and a credit to all of us, and have
kept the business in the family after we were in our graves.”
“ Pshaw, mamma ! how preposterous ! I am surprised at
my father’s infatuation for that young man. I esteem him quite
sufﬁciently for a friend, but "—and she looked an emerald ear-
ring in her delicate ear—“I could not exist with a husband
whose heart was in his business. My husband’s heart must
hold me and me only ; and I must have something to look at
as well as to love.”
“Ah ! Augusta, it must be a very small heart indeed which
cannot ﬁnd room both for a wife and a business to maintain
her ﬁttingly. The sheen of a dress which must last a life is of
less consequence than its durable texture.”
“ Well, mamma, so long as the material pleases my eyes, I
will take the wear upon trust. And do not be surprised that
your daughter prefers a ﬁne man and agentleman to one whose
fortune is in the clouds, and whose origin is so obscure, he has
not even a name to call his own.” _
She was standing to admire herself and her new jewellery 1n -

the Venetian glass between the windows as she said this, and
her mother’s ﬁgure ﬁlling in the frame, Jabez Clegg came and
went unseen, a pang in his heart and an intensiﬁed resolve to
make both fortune and name for himself even though his
master’s daughter vanished from his vision.
Nothing would induce Mr. Ashton to part with his child
until she was at least eighteen; and in that particular he was
proof against the importunities of Laurence and the cajoleries
of Augusta. So for ten months (during which the lawyers
had ample time to quarrel over the settlement of Augusta’s
£18,000, so that too much or too little should not be tied
down on the lady) the dashing young blade was on his trial,
so to speak, and contrived to beguile both father and mother
of their prejudices; whilst to Augusta a new world of gaiety
was opened out.
As her daughter’s chaperon, Mrs. Ashton renewed her ac-
quaintance with the yellow satin cushions of the Assembly
Rooms, the Gentlemen’s Concerts discoursed sweet music in
their ears, Miss Ashton could take her seat in the boxes of the
Theatre Royal without fear of Madame Broadbent’s fan, and
Kezia was in her glory, so many balls andparties had to be
catered for y; and Mr. Laurence Aspinall was in the ascendant.
All this was inexpressibly painful to Jabez, but as he had
written to Ben Travis that “ there was something more for men
to do than die of disappointment or blighted love,” so he set
his face like a rock against the breakers, and gave himself
entirely to business. He said to himself it would be cowardice
to ﬂee from that which must be home and mastered, so never
another word was heard of his seeking a home elsewhere. If
he was brave, he was not foolhardy enough to court pain in the
sight of his rival’s triumph, and though in his determination to
“stick to his last,” he had eschewed all art which came not
within the scope of pattern designing, to that he turned with
redoubled assiduity after business hours, having found a proﬁt-
able market apart from Mr. Ashton’s ﬁrm, as his account with
the Savings Bank in Cross .Street had borne‘witness from the
date of its establishment in Janu , 1818.
But for a brief space, and that whilst the wound was raw and
new, his ministrations to the dying chaplain of the Old Church
not only carried him out of sight and hearing, but in a measure
drew his thoughts away from his own sorrow.
Once only did Joshua scarify the sore. In an interval of
pain he said with his customary abruptness,
o

“And so that pretty lass of thy master’s is going to throw
herself away on the wild rascal who pitched thee over the
wall? ”
Jabez could not trust himself to answer save by a movement
of his head. '
“ Ugh lpshe’d better ha’ takken a fancy to thee l”
Half-an-hour or more elapsed. Waking from a doze, he
said——
“ Dost thou remember my telling thee to look at ‘ Hogarth’s
Apprentice’ in Chadwick’s parlour P ”
“ Indeed, I do! They have inﬂuenced my life,” answered
Mr. Clegg with a sigh, pouring out a dose of medicine as he
spoke. _
“ More physio, eh? Ugh 1 doctors kill more than they cure
with their stuff l Ay, lad, thah’st mounted up, thou’lt be a
master thyself some day, if thou dost not forget that fabez must
be an honourable man 1 ”
“I never did forget it sir, even though the apprentice boy
was mad enough to aspire to his master’s daughter! But
losing her, I have learned a new lesson. The prayer of the
olden Jabez, which has been mine night and mom from boy-
hood, was a prayer for self, and 5er only, and I had no right to
look for an answer to all the hopes I based upon it. If I have
not been ‘kept from evil,’ and it has ‘grieved me,’ I prayed,
for myself alone, and in grief I have my answer. Prayer should
take a wider range.”
“ Right, lad, right ! now let me sleep.”
When he waked again he remarked—
“It’s time for thee to be off, Jabez ,- but time is running
faster with me than thee, lad. Here, reach yon Terence
from the bureau. It is the Edinburgh edition. Keep it for
the sake of the rough old Parson who gave thee thy name.

on the eleventh, the fog had cleared away from Joshua
Brookes’s sight for ever ; and fountains of tears ran freely from
many eyes for the hot, hasty, single-minded, and learned Parson
whose name was a household word in the town, and who had
ever been a kind friend to Jabez. In his life he had been at
war with huckster-women, street-urchins, school-boys, and his
ecclesiastical brethren. In his death the wide parish, and more

than the parish, united to reverence his memory, those who
had laughed loudest at his eccentricities being foremost to
bewail him.
Even the November clouds hung thick and heavy as a pan
over the Old Church and churchyard, crowded with mourners,
when his silent remains were carried to their bed in the cross
aisles his feet had trodden so many active years, and if other;
besides Jabez shed tears over the open and honoured grave,
there was many an old creature mourning in solitude, besides
the queer old woman in kerchief and mutch, who sat amongst
her sweets in a closed shop, and-lamented that so young a
man as Parson Brookes should be carried off before her.”
“Well-a-day! and only sixty-seven! He’ll want no more
humbugs, and no more cakes for his pigeons. Poor Jotty ! ”
There was no mention of Jabez in his will, but when the
young man took the old worn Terence sadly and reverently
down from the shelf where he had ﬁrst placed it, on turning
over its leaves he found a bank note for ,6 300 pinned to the
fly-leaf, on which was inscribed his own name and that of the
eccentric donor.

CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST.
MARRIAGE!
AD Jabez been vindictive, the opportunity, or at least
the promise of revenge on his successful rival was not
wanting. Various efforts had been made to call the Manchester
Yeomanry to account for their doings at Peterloo, and many
had been the overtures and suggestions to Jabez Clegg by
members of the Radical party to join in the prosecution of the
offenders. But he resolutely refused to identify the trooper
who struck him, saying—
“ I forgave the man at the time, believing him to be drunk,
and incapable of discrimination. If I have since had reason
to think otherwise, I cannot be so mean as to allow private feel-
ing to inﬂuence a public act.”
It would be false to say there never was a tug at his heart-
strings when the tempters were again at his elbow, before they
made their ﬁnal attempt in 182 2. But he said to himself—
“If it would have been revengeful at the time when the
bodily injury was fresh, it would be doubly revengeful, mean,
and dishonourable now that he has supplanted me in love.
And in striking at him I should wound Augusta, and that must
never be.”
The temptation to expose his adversary was set aside, and
thus it was that Laurence Aspinall’s name was not added to
those of the four defenders on the record of the trial at Lan-
caster in April ; and as that trial, after the examination of
nearly a hundred witnesses of all ranks, terminated unsuccess-
fully for the prosecution, the forbearance of our friend Jabez
spared him at least the mortiﬁcation of defeat.
The year rolled on. At the instance of Mr. Ashton, Jabez
withdrew the bulk of his deposits from the Savings Bank, and
adding to Joshua Brookes’s gift the £ 200 he had accumulated
by ivorkgong late and early and saving small sums even during
2

his apprenticeship, placed all in his master’s hands, to be in-
vested in the business and so return him a higher rate of inte-
rest. And this was the ﬁrst absolute start of Jabez as a
capitalist.
The joyous excitement attending Augusta’s own preparations
for her approaching nuptials was somewhat damped by the un-
accountable condition of Ellen Chadwick, whose health, in- j
stead of improving during her visit to Carr Cottage, had ap-
peared to decline still more perceptibly. A constant pain at ‘
her chest, frequent headaches, uncertain spirits, and increasing
languor gave Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick real cause for uneasiness ;
but Ellen would not hear of a doctor, and maintained that it
was “ nothing to trouble about,” she should “ be better soon.”
But she did not get “better soon,” and when the ﬁrst
August sun shone on Augusta’s birthday and bridal, it taxed
her powers to the utmost to sustain efﬁciently her part as brides-
maid.
I—Iad Captain Travis accepted his lieutenant’s invitation to
be grooms_rnan,- she would have found it still more difﬁcult;
but a comparative stranger, a Mr. Joseph Bennett, of Gorton,
ﬁlled the post, the bride’s father having objected very decidedly
to bold Ned Barret.
Yet Ben Travis and Jabez Clegg were both among the
guests, albeit it cost each a struggle. The two had mutually
strengthened each other as such friends should, arriving at the
Spartan decision to “ suffer and be silent, facing'their fate like
men.” And indeed, old Mr. Ashton had wrung the hand of
Jabez at least a week before, and said—
“ I’m sorry for you, Clegg; I am, upon my soul; and I’m
sorry for our poor lass too, for she’s made a mistake. But
keep a brave heart, and don’t let that slashing yeomanry fellow
crow over you. As Mrs. Ashton would say, _‘What can’t be
cured must be endured,’ and we must all of us show the best
face at the wedding that we can.”
If that meant elaborate display in dress and decorations,
and provision for the bridal breakfast and dinner, then the face
exhibited was a shining one. Mrs. Hodgson, the fashion-
able mantua-maker and milliner of Oldham Street (where two
or three of the private houses had already been converted into
shops), had kept her apprentices at work almost night and day
for weeks, executing bridal orders from the Ashtons and their
friends. A very snowstorm might have passed through the
work-room. such heaps of white French-crape and satin, lace

and organdi, lute-string and gauze, littered and covered avail-
able space, putting matronly brocade, velvet, and llama quite
into the shade.
The warehouse saw little of Mrs. Ashton for a week or ten
days previously. Cicily, who had gone over to the Aspinalls,
had begged to be allowed to help Kezia for that occasion ; and
she roasted her own face in spinning gold and silver webs and
baskets from sugar for the table, making “ﬂoating islands,”
syllabubs, triﬁes, jellies, and blanc-mange to supplement the
solid dishes Kezia dressed with so much skill. And Mr.
Mabbott sent in a sugary “ Temple of Hymen ” and a bride’s
cake prepared six weeks in advance.
The bride, alternately radiant and tearful like an April day,
veiled with lace, and crowned with white rose-buds and orange-
blossoms, wore a low-bodiced dress of white satin, festooned
round the narrow skirt with costly lace, whilst on neck and
arms, and in her tiny ears, were negligé, bracelets, and earrings
of pearl, the gift of the gallant bridegroom’s gallant father.
The bridegroom was scarcely less resplendent in his high-
collared blue coat and gold buttons, his white waistcoat
buttoned to match, his glossy white trousers, and low shoes
tied with a bunch of silk ferret. An oblong brooch set with a
rim of pearls held down his broad ﬁne shirt-frills ; from his fob
hung a huge bunch of gold seals pendant from a ﬂat gold
watch chain ,' and in his hand (not crushing his elaborate curls,
now clustering richly as ever) he carried a hat of white beaver
of the newest shape.
To Mr. and Mrs. Ashton it was a matter of open regret that
]oshua Brookes, who had christened Augusta, should not have
lived to marry her also ; but Mr. Aspinall, whose reminiscences
of the old chaplain were of another order, was much better
satisﬁed to see his own personal friend Parson Gatliffe, the ban
viz/ant, behind the altar-rails. ,
If the bride was tall and graceful, with sunshine in her eyes
and in her classic curls, tall and stately was the bride’s mother,
whose long train of purple silk velvet swept the aisles, though
trains had ceased to be general. There was no faltering over
the responses. There was a glow of modest pride on the cheek
of Augusta ; a look of mingled ardour and exultation on the
face of Laurence 3 his “ I will ” was pronounced with a force
which was almost ﬁerce, yet, as she faintly promised to “ obey,”
he pressed her hand with smiling signiﬁcance.
The ceremony over, the bride did not faint, but turning to

her tearful-eyed father, threw her arms around his neck and
clung to him, whispering how grateful she was that he had
given her the man of her choice, and that he should see what a
good wife she would make ,- and the impromptu embrace sent
a shower of snuff over white satin and lace.
Yet some one fainted, whom Ben Travis caught in his strong
arms and carried to the church door for air: a dark-haired,
black-eyed bridesmaid, whose face was white and skin transpa-
rent as her own robe.
Custom had not set its imperative seal on the wedding tour.
as a necessity, but after a magniﬁcent solid dinner, to which
the party did full justice, and an elaborate dessert, during
which the cake was cut, and Mr. Aspinall proposed the health
of the bride in an inﬂated toast, demanding that it should be
drunk in bumpers, “ and no heel-taps,” the wedded pair drove
off in Mr. Aspinall’s carriage to the family mansion at Fallow-
ﬁeld, there to spend the honeymoon.
“ Good-bye, Jabez,” said Augusta, putting her small soft hand
into his as they left the house; “ you will comfort my father
and mother, will you not? I trust them to you.”
“And he replied with the fervency of truth, “ I accept the
trust willingly. Good-bye, Mrs. Aspinall ” (how the word
choked him 1) “ May God bless you, and the marriage you
have contracted. Good-bye l ”
He did not kiss her hand, had not taken the common liberty
of guests to kiss the bride’s lips in church; he did but press
her hand as any old friend who had grown up with her under
the same roof might have done; but before the carriage had
well dashed from the door, or the bridegroom had fairly settled
himself on his seat, Laurence turned to the fair young wife.
whose prophetic tears were now falling fast, with the sharp
rebuke—
“ What was that foundling fellow mumbling over your hand?
You will please to remember that that hand is mine now, Mrs.
Aspinall. You have promised to love and obey me—ME your
LORD and MASTER. And MASTER I mean to be. I have borne
the fooling of your friends and your own pretty caprices long
enough. It is my turn now; and if any man so much as dares
to look at you I’ll pound him to a jelly I And now dry your
eyes and give me a kiss l”
And that was the inauguration of Augusta Aspinall’s married
life.
It .has been said that the bridesmaid fainted. Every lady

carried a smelling bottle, and means to revive her were not far
to seek. She soon recovered, and with a sensitive blush with-
drew from the arms which had been so proud to sustain her,
casting her eyes round as if in search of some other whose ser-
vice might have been more acceptible. But she suffered no re-
lapse. She was ready to wait upon the bride, to sign “ Ellen
Chadwick” in the church register, and to assist Mr. Joseph
Bennett in cutting up the cake for distribution, with cards and
gloves, to friends not present. It was an arduous task, and she
succumbed before it was half completed.
“Miss Chadwick, you are not well ; let me relieve you,”
said Jabez, coming to her assistance after the “happy
pair” had driven off, and whilst peals of laughter, shouts, and
hurrahs came from the dining-room where gentlemen were
honouring the bridal by drinking themselves senseless and ‘
speechless. ‘
Ellen remained with her aunt a few days longer, during which
Jabez, exceedingly pained to see the ravages hidden disease
had made in so estimable a young lady, was pitifully attentive.
He could not, however, fail to see that his attentions dis-
tressed her ,- and, on the whole he was not sorry when Augusta’s
parents and he were left to themselves, to talk of their own
dear one and speculate on her future.
Weeks went by. Mrs. Aspinall visited her old home, but
never without her husband ,' and seldom was she allowed to
remain more than an hour. Her spirits seemed exuberant, but
somehow her unusual vivacity jarred on her mother’s nerves,
and she suspected that her spirits were forced.
Meanwhile Ellen Chadwick faded. Dr. Hardie, called in at
last, watched his patient with curious and attentive eye, per>
plexed and dubious. He had been friend as well as physician
since Mr. Chadwick’s attack of paralysis, and was a close ob-
server. Now he came and went in a gossiping sort of way, to
put his patient at ease, and off her guard. He was there one
day when Jabez was announced, and saw a sudden spasmodic
action of the face, a dilation of the pupils, a scarcely percep-
tible pant and parting of the lips, and then he watched her
closer. He introduced Mr. Clegg’s name, as if casually, whilst
his ﬁngers were on her pulse. The result of his observations
were told to Mr. Chadwick the same day.
“Your daughter has no speciﬁc disease, Mr. Chadwick, she
is simply lone-sick.”
“ L-love-s-sick ? ”


## p. 295 (#307) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 295
“Yes ; and her secret passion is consuming her. Medicine
cannot save the patient’s life if her affection be not-retumed,
and that right speedily. -
Mr. Chadwick was aghast. l
“ I feared as much,” said Mrs. Chadwick, with a sigh. -
“ Then you will have an inkling who is the desired object? ”
said the doctor.
“I think so.” >
“ Does your maternal instinct point to Mr. Clegg? ” he
asked, with a curious look.
“ It does ; but he himself has no suspicion, and I am sure
regards Ellen only as a friend—a friend elevated a little above
him ”
“ Is the young man courting ? ”
“ I believe not.”
“Then,” said the doctor sententiously, “the sooner he is,
the better for Miss Chadwick. Her life is not worth a month’s
purchase unless Mr. Clegg become the buyer. But let not
Miss Ellen hear a whisper of my opinion. I Good day.”
And snatching up his hat the doctor departed, leaving them
to their reﬂections.
Here was a delicate subject to be dealt with, and that with-
out either loss of time or the sacriﬁce of their beloved child’s
sensitiveness and reserve.
Unknown to Ellen a family conclave assembled under the
Mosley Street roof, to discuss the momentous question, and
deliberate what was best to be done. Long and grave were
their deliberations. At length, taking Mr. Chadwick’s imper-
fect speech into consideration, Mr. Ashton consented to lay
the case before Jabez, and leave his brother-in-law to supple-
ment it, if necessary ; though opinions were divided as to the
result.
It was after business hours. and Mr. Ashton found Jabez in
his own room, doing his best to dissipate thought by hard
work, mind and hand being busy with a chintz-pattem for
calico-printing.
There was a nervous plunge into the gold snuff-box, and a
consequent ﬂourish of a gay bandana, and some time spent in
examining the incomplete design on the desk, before Mr. Ash-
ton could fairly enter on his embassy. After a little prelude,
in which, whilst enlarging on the serious nature of his niece’s
illness, he elicited from Jabez that he held the young lady in
the very highest esteem, and was deeply grieved to hear of her

perilous state, he put down his snuff-box on the table before
him, and drawing up his chair so as to bring their heads closer
together, looked steadfastly into the other’s clear eyes as he put
the question—
“And what should you think of love as the cause of her
malady P ”
“LOVE !” echoed Iabez, his mind running off to the ago-
nised confession made to him on the Taxal hillside.
“Yes, love, and for the very man whose merits my foolish
child failed to see.”
Jabez looked at him vaguely.
“ Surely not Mr. Marsland l”
“Pah ! no ! ” exclaimed Mr. Ashton, as if disgusted at his
obtuseness. “ Yourself, man—Jabez Clegg.”
Jabez ﬁxed his eyes on his informant in blank amazement,
a monosyllabic long-drawn “Me ! ” being his sole response.
“Just so ! ” assented Mr. Ashton, and he took a pinch of
snuff on the strength of it.
“ Oh, sir, there must be some mistake ! How has this
been ascertained P Has Miss Chadwick made—”
“No, Clegg, the poor lass has never said one word, except
with her eyes and pulse. Dr. Hardie has made the discovery
now, and it turns out Mrs. Chadwick suspected it long ago.”
“ Oh, dear ! dear ! this is very terrible ! ”
He was estimating the pain in Ellen’s heart by that in his
own.
“Very terrible indeed, Clegg, for Hardie says the lass’s life
is not worth so much as a yard of ﬁlleting if her love meet no
return.”
The head of Jabez sank in his open hands upon the table.
What would his friend Travis think of all this P Presently he
raised his face, over which a strange change had passed.
“ Mr. Ashton, what would you have me do P ”
“ Whatever Jabez Clegg thinks he ought to do,” he answered
steadily, adding in another tone, “I would have been glad to
have given thee my own child : my brother-in-law implores
thee to take his child, to save her life.”
After a prolonged silence Jabez spoke.
“ Mr. Ashton, I hold that love alone can sanctify marriage:
my love has blossomed and died fruitless. Yet so highly do I
esteem Miss Chadwick, and so proud am I of the great honour
she has done me in her preference, that I place myself in your
hands. If I can spare so amiable a young lady the pain I

suffer from rejected love, I should be a brute and a savage to
refuse her the remnant of a valueless life. We may at least
soften its asperities for each other.”
The Chadwicks went home with minds relieved, but jabez
had stipulated that nothing should be said to Ellen of their
overtures to him, no hint given which could alarm her shrink-
ing modesty.
The following day he called to inquire about her health,
made his genuine anxiety apparent, and noted, as he had never
done before, how her lip trembled and her eyelid drooped.
Gradually, as his attentions became more marked, her health
and spirits rose, and when at last he proposed to her calmly,
quietly, as though he sought a haven when the frothy waves
of a ﬁrst'passion had subsided, she accepted him as God’s best
gift, all unaware that his offer was not spontaneous, or that her
cousin Augusta was yet deeply shrined in his secret heart.
He had been at ﬁrst greatly concerned about Ben Travis,
but the generous fellow, to whom he felt in honour bound to ex-
plain his conduct, only wrung his hand and said—
“ I could not resign her to a worthier.”

CHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND.
B L 0 W s .
ICHARD CHADWICK, who had served as a midship-
man under Admiral Collingwood, and shared in the
victory of Trafalgar, was a midshipman still, and his vessel had
long been away on a foreign station. Few, brief, and far be-
tween had been his opportunities to visit home and friends.
Ships had been paid off, but he had been exchanged, several
years had elapsed since he had set foot in Manchester, and the
hearts of his kin yearned towards their sailo'r.
His very whereabouts was unknown to them, and when
written communication was necessary, letters had to be for-
warded through the Admiralty.
Ellen’s engagement and prospective marriage called forth a
voluminous epistle, crossed and recrossed like a trellis, from
Mrs. Chadwick to her son, whose presence she craved, if leave
of absence could possibly be obtained. The letter was a
singular compound of gratulation and apology, through which a
thin undercurrent of dissatisfaction meandered like a stream.
His sister’s strange malady and infatuation for a man of appa-
rently low origin, whose name and parentage were alike un-
known, were set forth to be deplored. Still, since the sole
remedy for Ellen’s ailment rested with this obscure Mr. Clegg
whose career upwards, from his floating cradle to his honour-
able position in the Ashton house and warehouse, was circum-
stantially detailed, his personal worth was a matter for congratu-
lation ; and the deep obligation of the whole family to him for
the service rendered on Peterloo-Day seemed dragged in as
a sort of extenuating circumstance. Clearly the Mr. Travis,
whose name and pretensions cropped up here and there through~
out the letter would have been a more acceptable son-in-law in
the sight of Mrs. Chadwick and his other sister, Charlotte
Walmsley, ancha just as clearly it was made apparent that his

paralysed father (hale and strong in all other respects) was as
much infatuated with the young man as was Ellen, having
“positively offered to take him into partnership on his entrance
into the family.” And even there Mrs. Chadwick felt “ con-
strained to admit that the clear head, business tact, and energy
of Mr. Clegg would be a great acquisition.” '
This item of news closed the missive, which must have gone
a circuitous round of red tape it was so long upon its travels.
Months came and went; Father Christmas shook his snowy
locks over the town ; but neither the midshipman nor a written
substitute put in an appearance.
Meanwhile Jabez, who had crushed down in the garden of
' his heart those roots of his love for Augusta which mocked his
strength ,to eradicate, did his best to plant and foster above
them a grateful affection for the one who had chosen him, and
hoped in time that the newer growth might utterly extinguish
the old. His attentions to Ellen were more' assiduous than,
under the circumstances, might have been expected; but he
argued with himself——
' “ I must endeavour to atone to her for a proposal in which
love had no part. She must never have occasion to suspect the
truth. I should be a brute did I remain insensible to the un-
conquerable love she has so long cherished in secret for me.
Augusta’s face, alas ! was more divinely fair, her manner more
enchanting; but Ellen, though she is older than myself, will
doubtless make the best wife for a business man who has to
carve his way to fortune, and she loves me / ”
Ellen, too, had her seasons of doubt and perplexity. She
had been so sensitively alive to the silent homage of Jabez
Clegg to her younger and fairer cousin that at ﬁrst her mind
had refused to realise the fact that he desired to marry her,
even though his proposal had been preceded by direct and pal-
pable attention. She had been at ﬁrst inclined to attribute his
many acts of kindness and courtesy to friendship and com-
passion for her failing health. And when he had spoken of
being won by her many estimable qualities to seek her for a
wife, she had listened incredulously ; then, overpowered by
contending emotions, sank back amongst her cushions in a
state of insensibility. Even her tremulous acceptance had
been uttered as in a blissful dream, which might vanish all too
soon. From time to time she perplexed herself with questions
of the motive for so sudden a change in one so steadfast as
Jabez, and at last wavered between the two suppositions that

Augusta’s wilfulness had wearied him, or that she owed her
lover to pique. Of the real state of the case she had no ink-
ling.
She was not alone in her latter supposition.
“ A happy new year to you, Mrs. Clowes ! ” said our friend
Jabez to his friend the old confectioner, as at one stride he
took the two steps to her conﬁned shop on the bright frosty
second of January, 1823, and extended his hand to her across
the counter, where she still kept up a show of activity in spite a
of age and wrinkles.
“Same to you, Mr. Clegg.”
She had been one of the ﬁrst to recognise his right to the pre-
ﬁx, and with all her old-fashioned familiarity never dropped it.
“Eh, but now I look at thee, thah doesn’t look ower bright
an’ happy ;” and she peered into his face inquiringly.
He smiled.
“ Looks are not always to be relied on. I ought to be
happy, for I am about to be married, and my errand hither is
tO—H
She interrupted him with—
“ So I’ve heard. But what 0’ that? Is she th’ reet un ?
For I wouldna give a mince-pie for thi happiness if she isna.”
The blood mounted painfully to his forehead.
“ Miss Chadwick is all that is estimable and amiable, Mrs.
Clowes,” he answered steadily, “ and if I am not happy with
her it will be my own fault.”
The old dame was not satisﬁed. The white linen lappets of
her antiquated mutch ﬂapped like a spaniel’s ears as she shook
her head. \
“ Eh, well ! ” sighed she, opening and shutting a drawer in
the counter abstractedly, “ you should know best, but both me
and Parson Brookes (dead and gone as he is) thought you’d
set your mind on th’ lass that rantipollin lad Aspinall snapped
up. I hope thah’s not goin’ to wed th’ cousin out o’ spite,” and
she looked up in his face, over which a cloud had swept. “ It
would be the worst day’s work you ever did, either for her or
you.”
He had mastered his emotion, and answered cheerfully—
“Make your mind easy, Mrs. Clowes. I am not marrying
from any unworthy motive, and I think our prospect of happi-
ness is about the average. I came to ask you, as the oldest
friend I have in the town, to be present on the occasion.”
Mrs. Clowes was overpowered.

“ What l Mr. Clegg ! Me, in my old black stuff gown and
mutch, among your grand folk P Nay, nay ; I’m too old to don
weddin’ garments. But I tell you what ”——and her face
puckered with pride and pleasure—“ you shall have the ﬁnest
wedding-cake that ever was baked i’ Manchester, and the old
woman will mebbe look on the weddin’ from some quiet nook,
out 0’ the way. It’s a thousand pities Jotty is not alive to
marry you P ”
“There will be no grand folk, Mrs. Clowes; I am but a
poor man struggling upwards, and Miss Chadwick has not had
good health of late ; so we shall be married very quietly on
Wednesday week. Only very near relatives, or old friends are
invited.”
Customers interrupted the colloquy. When the shop was
clear, she asked where he was going to live after marriage, and
was told, with his bride’s parents.
“ Eh! but that’s a bad look out. Now, I’ve built some
houses in a new street off Oxford Road as they call Rosamund
Street, “ an’ I’ll tell you what, you shall have one to live in at
a peppercorn rent, and I’ll lend you the money to furnish it.
Young folks are best by themselves.”
Clear and bright were the eyes that met hers in reply.
“ Thank you, Mrs. Clowes, thank you heartily for your kind
offer; but I think you lose sight of Mr. Chadwick’s inﬁrmity.
He has acted very liberally towards me—in fact, has offered to
take me into partnership—and I should ill repay him by
removing from his hearth the good daughter on whom he re-
lies. It is rather my duty to add to the comfort of his declining
years.” ,
“Oh ! ” said she, sharply; “ if that’s how you raise your
crust I’d best keep my ﬁngers out of your pie.”
Jabez was going. The shop was full.
“ Stay, Mr. Clegg,” said she, beckoning him into her parlour,
and closing the door. “It’s hard cheese for a man to owe
everything to his father-in-law. I’ve got ,6 500 hanging on
hand. It’s not much, but the least bit of capital would make
you feel independent, and its heartily at your service; and if
you don’t like to take it without interest, you can pay me one
per cent., and repay me when you’ve made a fortune ; and if
that doesn’t come till I lay under a stone bed-quilt, you can
hand it over to my ﬁrst godchild.”
That same evening Augusta Aspinall stood before a large
oval swing-glass in her luxurious dressing-room, the blazing ﬁre

shed its warm glow on polished furniture, amber silk hangings,
bright ﬁre-irons, costly mirrors, and expensive toilet ware (of
execrable shape). She was robing for a ball at the Assembly
Rooms, and Cicily, who, although cook, insisted on retaining
her post as lady’s maid on such occasions, had just fastened
the last hook of a delicate lilac ﬁgured silk as soft as it was
lustrous, with swansdown fringing skirt, sleeves, and bodice, as
if to show how fair was the symmetrical neck of the wearer to
stand such test. .
In came Laurence fresh from the Spread Eagle in Hanging
Ditch, where he, a newly-elected member of the Scramble
Club, had spent the afternoon with one or two others, forgetful
that the origin of the club was the fourpenny pie and glass of
ale, or at most the slice from a joint despatched in a hurry or
“ scramble ” by business men to whom time was money.
Neither time nor money seemed of much value to Mr.
Laurence, who was equally lavish with both, taking as much
from his father’s business and adding as little as could well be
imagined. His step on the threshold caused Augusta to turn
round, beaming and beautiful, and dart towards him, exclaim-
ing—
“ I’m so glad you’ve come 1 ” simultaneously with his “ Clear
out, Cis ! ” and a warm embrace which somewhat disarranged
the dainty dress. His wife was yet a new toy, and his passion
had not had time to evaporate. She was a_ something to admire
and exhibit for admiration as a possession of his own; and
though her love had received one or two rude shocks, he was
still a gloriﬁed being in her eyes, and she clung to him as a
true wife should cling. She was still but a girl in her teens,
proud of the admiration she excited. Disengaging herself, she
cried—
“Oh, Laurence, see how you have crushed my swansdown !
and now, dear, do make haste and dress, we shall be so late,”
and putting the ﬂuffy trimming in order, she unlocked a small
jewel case on the table, and took thence the pearls she had
worn on her wedding-day.
“What will you say for these, Augusta?” cried he, dangling
before her eyes a gossamer scarf and an exquisite ivory fan,
whilst his other arm thrown over her white shoulders again
threatened the elastic down. '
“ Oh, Laurence, you are a darling I Where did these beauti-

“India, my love: they are ‘ far-fetched and dear-bought,’
and so must be good for you, my lady. I met your uncle
Chadwick with an old sea-captain, from whom I bought them.
By the way, matrimony seems catching. We are invited to a
wedding,” and he began leisurely to undress as he spoke.
“A wedding ! Whose?”
He laughed.
“ Ah, woman all over ! I thought I had news for you.
Guess !”
In small things as well as great it was his delight to tantalize,
so he kept her guessing whilst he proceeded with his toilet, and
she began to clasp her pearls on arms and neck, and in her
pretty ears.
“ Well,” said he at length, “who but your cousin Ellen 1”
“Ellen P ” She had gone so little near her own family that
this was indeed news for her.
“ Yes ; I thought she meant to die an old maid, but it seems
she’s not too proud to wear your cast-off slippers.”
“ My cast-off slippers P What do you mean?” and she
paused whilst clasping her bracelet with a look of bewildered
interrogation.
“ Now, Augusta, pray don’t look so innocent l—Your father’s
favourite fetch-and-carry, that sneaking, canting fox, Jabez
Clegg, ﬁnding that Miss Ashton was a sour grape, has straight-
way gone wooing to Miss Ashton’s cousin as fruit ripe enough
and near enough to drop into his vulpine jaws ; and by G--—
the girl has had no more spirit than to drop when he shook
the boughs, rather than hang on untasted l ”
The speaker’s lip and nose had curled with contempt as he
began, then his nostril dilated, and he struck his wet hand on
the washstand with a force which threatened the earthenware
and set it jingling. ' _ _
Augusta was not yet schooled to silence ; her generous spirit
rose to repel these allegations.
“Oh, Laurence, how can you P Ellen has had plenty of
admirers ; she has no need to wear anyone’s cast-off shoes.
And as for Mr. Clegg ! He is no cast-off slip ” she checked
herself; a thousand trivial and forgotten things ﬂashed across
her mind at once ; there was no doubt that Jabez had aspired
to her own hand—he must have offered himself to Ellen in
pique, to look as if he didn’t care ; she could not add the “of
mine,” which should have rounded her sentence; she substi~
tuted, with barely a moment’s pause, “ He is neither a sneak

nor a cant, and if Ellen marries him she will have a good hus-
band ; ” adding, with marvelloust little tact or knowledge of her
own husband, “ I’m sure, Laurence, dear, you have no right to
speak ill of the man who saved your life in the very pond that is
frozen over now before our doors ! And you cannot really think
him mercenary, when he refused the £ 500 your father offered
as a reward for his bravery.”
Not lightning was more quick and scathing than the fury
which ﬂashed from her husband’s eyes and almost paralysed
his tongue, as the last words fell from her lips. With the damp
towel in his hand he struck across her beautiful bare shoulders
with a force which traced red lines upon their snow ; then
marked her round arm with a band as red by tearing away the
suspended fan and scarf, which he threw behind the ﬁre with-
out one thought of either “ far-fetched ” or “ dear-bought.”
“ Soh, madam ! ” he hissed rather than spoke, whilst
Augusta shrank from him in affright, “soh! you dare defend
the wretch who played the spy on us at Carr—attacked me, an
unarmed man, with a stick, like a coward, and left me bleeding
there for dead, hoping to win the heiress for himself 1 ”
From her father and Cicily both she had gathered the truth
of that night’s exploits. His misrepresentations no longer mis-
led ,; but for very fear she help her peace.
He went on—
“ Madam, that night’s savage attack cancelled every debt of
gratitude I owed the calculating knave who turned his back on
my father’s ,6 500, thinking to multiply it by thousands from
your father 1”
“\It is not true l” she dared to say, her sense of justice and
her spirit of resistance rising in defence of one she knew to be
foully aspersed. Not because he was Jabez Clegg but because
he was an absentee maligned.
A shriek rang through the big house, and servants came
scurrying up, with Mr. Aspinall in their midst ; and Cicily, the
ﬁrst to dash between them, caught on her well-covered back the
blow from the madman’s brace, which would else have fallen
afresh on the naked shoulders of his wife, already scored by it
with livid welts. _
Carry away the fainting lady—soothe the infuriated savage—
apply raw beef to shoulders as red, if not as raw—let the brute
steep himself in brandy unto stupefaction. The morning will
come, when the fumes of passion and brandy will alike have
Passed away, and the man will repent him of his cruelty. But

the sting of groundless jealousy will remain, and the broad livid
stripes across the white shoulders. Time and care will efface
those marks, but neither kisses, nor caresses, nor presents, nor
time itself can obliterate the hieroglyphics stamped with that
buckskin brace on the young wife’s heart. He has ﬁxed the
name of Jabez Clegg there, and in conjunction “brute” and
“ liar,” as equivalent to his own.
It might have been expected after this that the Aspinalls
would have been conspicuous by their absence from the
cousin’s wedding, or that Augusta might have laid her wrongs
before her mother. But, no ; your jealous man never spares
himself a pang if he hopes to inﬂict one ; and the wilful woman
who ﬁnds she has made a mistake in marriage is the last to
confess it.
Cold weather and recent indisposition served as an apology
for the violet velvet spencer which, worn above the pale lilac
silk, covered bust and neck; and it was far from unbecoming
to the young matron or the occasion.
Old Mrs. Clowes—who had kept her word anent the cake,
which was a triumph of confectionery skill—from some long-
closed coffer brought forth a stiff brocade of ancient make and
texture, placed a bonnet on her unaccustomed head, and from
a far seat in the choir watched Jabez Clegg enter with his
college friend and groomsman, stalwart George Pilkington,
though she did not see them linger to read the inscription over
the grave of Joshua Brookes, or look up with grateful remem-
brance to the Chetham Gallery, where they had worshipped
together. But she remembered them as boys in long blue
gowns and yellow under-skirts, and could not help contrasting
the college dress of the past with the high-collared bright
blue coats, the gilt buttons, lemon-coloured vests, light trousers,
and white kid gloves, in which they found their way to her to
shake hands, whilst waiting for the trembling white-robed bride
and her friends.
And there Mrs. Clowes sat and listened to the irrevocable
words which bound Jabez to “love and cherish ” the woman
who loved him with her whole soul ; whilst in spite of himself
his very brain was reeling with memories of that other wed-
ding-day, when Laurence Aspinall and Augusta Ashton, now
standing calm and beautiful in the background, had breathed
the selfsame vows before that altar; and somehow the old
dame had a secret misgiving when all was over that it was
“ not the reet one after alL”

“ All over i” had been the cry from the heart of Jabez then.
“ All over l” was the echo now, as the last “ Amen” sounded,
and he registered a silent oath, not down in the rubric, to keep
the troth he had plighted, although no electric thrill an-
swered the shy touch of Ellen’s hand, or the dumb devotion
of her glance, and although Augusta’s greeting of her new
“cousin ” jarred a still sensitive nerve.
All over! so men delude themselves. “All over!” they
say, when disappointment closes the doOr of the past, and
veils their eyes to the vista of the future. “ All over!” when
the curtain falls on the prologue of life’s drama. Yet it rises
again, and they ﬁnd that the play has but just begun.

PARTNERSHIP.
Y dint of persuasion old Mrs. Clowes was induced to
place her well-saved brocade at the table graced by the
wedding-cake she had manufactured; though, as she after—
wards said conﬁdentially to Jabez, “ I must have had as much
brass in my face as I had i’ my pocket to sit down cheek-by-
jowl wi’ grand folks with foine manners, who might come into
my shop th’ next day to be served with a pound o’ ginger-_
bread ,' but I’d not ha’ missed Mester Ashton’s toast for sum-
mat. And I don’t know as annybody turned up a nose bout
it wur that spark Aspinall, who owes me for manny a quarter a
pound of humbugs.”
Round that hospitable and substantial wedding-breakfast,
which owed much of ' its success to the bride’s own deft
ﬁngers, also gathered the Cloughs, who had watched the
career of the bridegroom with interest from his cradle—Miss
Clough as bridesmaid; Mr. John M‘Connel and Henry
Liverseege, who had cultivated his friendship from their ﬁrst
introduction; ,John Walmsley and Charlotte, who privately
chafed at his reception into the family; and Augusta, whose
brilliancy was somewhat dimmed by the overt watchfulness or
too courteous and attentive Laurence ; but there was no Ben
Travis, and missing him, Jabez was disposed to gravity. But
though there were uncongenial elements present, George Pi1_
kington’s cheery voice and lively sallies sufﬁced to set mirth
afoot and keep her dancing; whilst Mrs. Ashton, stately and
proverbial, seemed to share some pleasant secret with which
Mr. Chadwick and her husband were on the quz' m've.
It was the age for toasts and sentiments. Some smart and
witty things had been uttered, but not until the cake was cut
and commended, and a post-chaise at the door waited to
convey argue newly-married pair to Carr Cottage and the ear-

liest friends of the bridegroom, did Mr. Ashton rise to his
feet, snuff-box in hand, and with a merry twinkle in his eye
propose—
“ Success to the new partnership !”
“Stop, my friends !” said he, as glasses were elevated in
honour of the toast; perhaps I had better explain what is
meant by the new partnership.”
“1 should think that was pretty obvious,” whispered
Laurence to his friend Walmsley across the table, but he
changed his opinion presently.
“There are partnerships for life,” continued Mr. Ashton,
“ where the contract is attested in church, as we have had the
'pleasure of witnessing to-day, and, I am sure, with the best
of wishes for its success; and there are partnerships in busi-
ness, which are usually signed, sealed, and attested in a law-
yer’s ofﬁce ,' and it is to such a one I now refer, in conjunction
with the former.”
He paused to consult his snuff-box, and smiled to see how
suddenly inattentive heads were eagerly bent forward to listen.
“It may not be generally known that my dear nephew Jabez,
at the close of his honourable apprenticeship, declined an
eligible offer from brothpr Chadwick, in order to remain
with us.” ' '
(Walmsley and Aspinall exchanged glances. Mrs. Clowes
looked knowing.)
“ It may not be generally known that he has a small amount
of capital invested in our concern at present.”
(“ Small enough, I should say,” muttered Laurence.)
“ Now, there being no likelihood that his son Richard will
ever leave his ship for a warehouse, Mr. Chadwick proposed
to take his son-in-law Jabez into equal partnership, considering
his integrity, his business tact, and energy to be equivalent to
capital.”
“Hear! hear l” in which Mr. Chadwick’s stumbling tongue
was loudest, and “Success to the new partnership l”
(The snuff-box closed, the bandana was disposed of, the
speaker’s beaming face was all in a glow.)
“Stop! stop, gentlemen! not so fast. You will have to
ﬁll your glasses afresh. We have not yet got to the new part-
nership.”
(“What the d-——l is he driving at P” was Aspinall’s polite
query to Walmsley, who shook his head in token of igno-
rance.)

“Brother Chadwick had concluded that Mr. Clegg was
wholly without capital, whereas he happens to have more than
a thousand pounds at his disposal.”
(Broadcloth made sudden acquaintance with chairbacks.
George Pilkington grasped his friend’s hand ,- there was a
puckering of Mrs. Clowes’s wrinkles; there were lowering
brows from Laurence and John.)
“And Mr. Clegg being perfectly satisﬁed with his present
investment, and anxious to join the gingham manufacturer
without quitting the small-ware manufacturer, proposed "—
pinch of snuff—“ that the two concerns should he amalgamated,
and he have a share. Gentlemen and ladies, the proposal was
hailed as an inspiration; and as soon as the change can be
legally effected, the ﬁrm will be gazetted as ‘Ashton, Chad-
wick, and Clegg !’ And now let us drink—J Success to the
new partnerships, matrimonial and commercial 1”
Aspinall’s voice alone remained silent amongst the enthu-
siastic cheers with which the toast was drunk. Ellen, with
humid eyes, escaped to change her garments, and Augusta also
rose; but as she passed the new Manchester Man, around
whom friends crowded with congratulations, she put out her
hand with a smile, and said, “Cousin Jabez, I wish success to
both your partnerships with all~my heart.”
Laurence was at her elbow, apparently to lead her with
courteous ceremony from the room, and whilst offering one
hand with a graceful inclination of his head, he contrived with
the other to pinch the upper part of her arm, and to whisper
in her ear, between his set teeth——
“ D—n you, madam ! You shall smart for this i”
An irrepressible ejaculation of pain burst from her. More
than one turned round. There was real concern on the brow
of Jabez as he asked—
“What is the matter, Mrs. Aspinall P Are you hurt P"
She made light of it.
“Oh, nothing, nothing. I struck my foot against a chair—
that was all.”
But Jabez saw the white, frightened face, and felt there was
something more 3 and that scared look haunted him for many
a day.
Laurence attended his wife to the staircase, smiling blandly
whilst within sight or ear-shot. Ere he left her at the stair-
foot he gripped her tiny hand till her jewelled rings cut the
ﬂesh ; and the smile became satanic as he whispered-—

“ You are discreet, madam. I charge you to remain so—
for your life 1” ~~-
Once in Ellen’s crowded bedchamber she became hysterical,
to her cousin’s great grief. But she overmastered her emotion
by a violent effort, excused it on the plea‘of recent indispo-
sition, and was consoled by her mother and other sagacious
matrons with the remark that such affections might be ex-
pected. The newly-married pair were whirled away down
Oldham Street and up Piccadilly ; old Mrs. Clowes took her
departure, and then Augusta, acting on Mrs. Clough’s advice,
lay on the drawing-room sofa to rest.
Not until night did the guests depart, Mr. Liverseege being
the ﬁrst to retire. There was a late dinner at six o’clock, and
when the gentlemen rose from their post-prandial wine, and
sought the drawing-room, all considerably elevated, Laurence
Aspinall was too intoxicated to move. The Aspinall carriage
had been waiting an hour. The coachman and Bob the groom
grew anxious and impatient about the horses.
“Mr. Laurence drunk? Eh ! that matters nowt 1” ex
claimed the latter. “Steve an’ me ’11 manage him.” And
taking the limp young Hercules between them, they somehow
hauled him to the carriage, and esconced him in one corner,
with his head drooping on his breast.
Augusta shrank from joining him, afraid lest he should
awake to malicious consciousness on the road.
“ Oh ! I dare not go home with him! Indeed, I dare not
go home with him l”
“ My dear,” said her mother gravely, “ I am afraid you must.
A wife cannot absent herself from home because her lord and
master indulges in too much wine, even though he may occa-
sionally make a beast of himself. It is too late to think of
this now. What cannot be cured must be endured. As you
made your own bed, you will have to lie on it to the end.
Those who leave the spring for the stream must expect muddy
water. However, there is nothing so bad but it might be
worse. Once is not always, and love overlooks lapses.”
Augusta’s persistence that she dared not be “shut up with
him alone,” caused Mrs. Ashton to say—
“Well, my daughter, the occasion has been so unusual that
even your own father has taken more wine than his wont, or he
might bear you company. That groom seems a steady man ;
suppose he rides inside to support his master; and whatever
you do, remember when wine is in wit is out, silence is awife’s

safeguard, and you will have to make the best of a bad
bargain.”
A month back Augusta would have tossed her head, and
laughed lightly at her mother’s pet philosophy. That night she
rode home from Jabez Clegg’s wedding feast with a groom and
a drunken man, pondering whether spirited resentment or
tame submission was her best course. The morning dawned
on a wife pinched black and blue, with hardly strength or
spirit to sob.
Then followed a reaction, and a period of remorseful
uxorious penitence, during which Laurence submitted with a
tolerable grace to a lecture from Mr. Aspinall, who saw that
something was amiss ; and chivalrous gallantry towards woman
being part of this gentleman’s creed, he did not spare
his son. ,
Nor did Laurence spare himself. He knelt at his wife’s
feet, called her “an angel,” and himself “a savage,” im-
plored her forgiveness, excused his jealousy on the ground of
passionate love, lavished his means on extravagant gifts for
her, and exhausted language in fair promises. But so proud
was he of his wife’s beauty, that he must needs exhibit at
theatre and assembly the jewel he had won ; whilst the admira-
tion she excited set his jealous brain on ﬁre, and she paid
the penalty in the silence of night, or even in the close
carriage driving home.
But his contrition and the old plea of “ excessive love ” for
his jealous inﬁrmity won her over, and not even Cicily more
than suspected half his cruelty.

Great preparations had been made at Whaley-Bridge for the
reception of Mr. and Mrs. Clegg ; the factory windows were
extra burnished; the landlord of the White Hart hoisted a
ﬂag; the mill-hands lined the road to greet them ; the avenue
gate was thrown open that the chaise might drive on to the
cottage; somebody had put Crazy Joe into a new suit of
clothes for the occasion, and he stood by the side of little
Sim on the step of the Gothic arch (the greater child of the
twain) to laugh and chuckle a welcome, as sincere in its way
as the homely greetings of the orphan’s fosterers.
It was a ﬁne stalwart young man, of open but grave
countenance, around whom Bess threw her motherly arms,
while Tom Hulme helped the bride to alight, and marshalled
the way for the pair, who followed arm-in-arm into the house-

place, where Simon, stiff with age and rheumatism, kept pos-
session of the padded chair set apart for the sick or aged.
In some way the knowledge that Mr. Clegg came as a
master, and not as a servant, had preceded him.
“Eh, Jabez, lad, exclaimed Simon, tears of joy coursing
down his cheeks, “that aw should ever live to see this day!
Would annyone ha’ thowt as th’ little lass at’ played an" ar
Jabez an’ his toys, an’ kissed him when he wur a babby, would
come to wed himwhen he wur a mon—an’ a gentlemon into
th’ bargain! An’ neaw let thi wife goo an’ tak’ oﬂ her pelisse
while thah talks to me ,- hoo’ll be tired wi’ th’ lung journey,
aw reckon. Theere’sa ﬁre i’ th’ best parlour, that’s th’ place
fur gentlefolk, an’ ’yo’r supper’s laid theer.”
Old Simon naturally concluded that young lovers wanted no
society but each other. On ﬁve-year-old Sim such a con-
sciousness had not yet dawned, and so he penetrated into the
“best parlour,” and, much to the relief of the bridegroom,
broke into that ﬁrst domestic tete-a-tete to exhibit some wonder-
ful pictures he had drawn with red ruddle picked from the
gravel-path.
They had been at Carr Cottage little more than ten days or
a fortnight, the ﬁrst week being wet ; Jabez, without neglect—
ing Ellen, busied himself with contemplated changes and im-
provements at the mill, and thus the great bane of the modern
honeymoon was avoided. The occupation thus found for the
mind and hand of Jabez at that particular epoch of his life
was a blessing for which Ellen had need to be thankful in after
years, if she had but known it.
As it was, she did fancy he might have given her a little
more of his time, and not have needed her suggestion to re-
visit Taxal and the spot where he had wooed her for another,
and not for himself. Yet a very slight hint was sufﬁcient, and,
taking advantage of a clear, dry day, the two re-trod the old
path by the Goyt, which awoke reminiscences that could but
be ﬂattering to that self-love of which every human being has
a share.
Sitting down as man and wife on the lightning-scathed tree-
trunk, which had never been removed, he remembered the
confession wrung from her agony on that very spot; his arm
stole round her waist in the pitiful compassion it evoked. A
new emotion stirred within his breast. He folded his wife in
his arms, and pressed upon her answering lips his ﬁrst spon-
taneous kiss of dawning affection.

Half-way home they were met by Crazy Joe, who had been
sent to seek them. A consecutive message was beyond his
grasp. All they could make out was, “ Back ! Sharp!
Quick I” And, hastening on in alarm, they at length dis-
cerned Mr. Ashton at the gate, on the look-out. His pleasant
nod was reassuring.
“ My dear,” he cried to Ellen, as they advanced, “ Dick has
got his promotion at last ; Lieutenant Chadwick has been
duly gazetted. Here is his letter to your mother, dated from
Mal—~—Stop, my dear l "—Ellen had put out her hand for the
thick, heavy missive—“A communication which called your
old uncle Ashton out of his way to act as courier is not to be
dealt with lightly. And before it is read I must know whether
you would rather be Mrs. Clegg or Mrs. Travis?”
Closer she clung to the arm of Jabez.
“Oh, uncle ! How can you ask P”
There was a sly gleam in the corner of his eye.
“ Ah! just so. That’s it. How can I ask? ”
But his face sobered. He handed the letter to his new
nephew. ,
“Jabez, I think you had better carry it to your own room
for private perusal. I will communicate its conterfts to all
whom it may concern besides.”
Jabez had deep feelings, though he was not demonstrative,
and long before he had mastered its contents he was thankful
for the delicacy which had spared him an open display of irre~
pressible emotion. _
The writer, who was stationed at Malta, after dwelling on his
own promotion, and answering sundry maternal qriestions rela-
tive to himself, went on to say—
“And so our Nell’s going to be married. Well, it’s about
time—she’ll be twenty-six next April, or I’ve lost my
reckoning.
“And so she was fretting herself to ﬁddle-strings for a fellow
younger than herself, and without a shilling or a name, when
she might have had a ﬁner fellow, with name and shiners to
boot. Bravo! Nell, for choosing a brave lad instead of a
money-bag! She’s the sister for a sailor, whatever Charlotte
may think. -
“But your story of the ﬂood and the cradle, and your men-
tion of Mr. Travis, coming both together, recall a story I had
forgotten, which may perhaps furnish a name for Nell’s hero of
the Irk and Peterloo.

“ We had a broad-set sailor on board the Royal _Soverez'gn, .
who was always getting into scrapes for chalking caricatures of
the ofﬁcers on the bunks and cabin-doors; but there wasn’t a
man fore or aft that hadn’t at some time or other coaxed a
picture or portrait out of him, to send to mother or sweetheart,
and never a Jack Tar amongst them would split on good-
natured Ben Travis.”
Down dropped the shaking hand that held the letter. Ben
Travis / What strange coincidence was this?
“ His father had been a Liverpool shipbroker, and Ben took
to me because I was a Lancashire lad like himself, though he
was old enough to be my father. He had been pressed, and
as I was the youngest middy, and he the master of the fore-
castle, many a time had he told me the sad story of his life.
His father had died without a will, and Ned his eldest brother
had laid his clutches on everything but a hundred pounds or
so, which had been the mother’s. Ben turned his back on
Liverpool and his brother, and being smart with his pencil, took
to that to get a living. He wandered about to pick up bits of
scenery, and at Crumpsall fell in with a widow and her
daughter, both named Ann Crompton, and went to lodge with
them. After awhile he married the lass, and thinking if he
meant to earn a living for his wife and the child that was
coming he’d best seek a large town, he removed to Manchester,
and took an old cottage in Smedley Vale, where he hoped to
turn his talent to account.”
The paper rattled, and Jabez leaned against the window-
frame, as much for support as light, as he read on with pant-
ing lips.
“ He tried portrait-painting, but lacked a patron ; he turned
his head to patterndesigning, but no one would employ a raw
beginner. His money was dwindling, and a birth was near at
hand. He doted on his wife, and for her sake wrote to his
brother, who was married when their father died. Ned wrote
back, enclosing a bank-note, and begging to see him at once.
His wife had died, leaving a baby-boy, whom he had christened
Ben, after his runaway brother. Ned said her loss was killing
him, and he wished to leave his boy in his brother’s care before
he died. Poor Ben Travis kissed his wife, and went by coach
to Liverpool. Before he could reach his brother’s ofﬁce in
Castle-street, near the docks, he was pounced upon by a press-
gang, dragged on board a ship in the Mersey, and never saw
brother, or wife, or home again. I have seen Ben’s tears roll

down his weather-beaten cheeks many a time as he told this.
He was one of the ﬁrst sent down to the cock-pit at the battle
of Trafalgar, and when Admiral Nelson’s glorious remains went
home to be buried, Ben went likewise, to hospital, and I lost
sight of him. When I was exchanged to the Exeellem‘, Ben
turned up again, hearty, but aged with grief. He had sought
his dear ones, but a ﬂood had swept through Smedley Vale in
1799, and left no trace of his home. A man at the dye-works
remembered something about an old woman they called stiff-
backed Nan being killed by the falling house in trying to save
a baby ,' but Ben could learn no more, and his own impres-
sion was that wife, child, and mother-in-law had perished in
the same catastrophe. He went to Liverpool. Death had
swept off his brother; executors swept off the son Ben, his
namesake. He went back to sea, and I saw_ the brave Ben
Travis drowned in trying to save a bumboat woman, who fell
overboard off Spithead. ‘
“And now, mother, you used to be a good hand at patch-
work—piece my story and your story together, and see if
Ellen’s poor cradle-friend is not near of kin to your rich
friend, Mr. Benjamin Travis, with quite as good a right to be
called Mr. Travis too.
“ I should have a rough sketch of the old sailor, drawn with
a quid of ’bacca on the fly-leaf of his Prayer-book. I’ll look
it up for Nell.”

CHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH.
MAN AND BEAST.
HE January twilight had deepened into dusk, and from
dusk to .dark, before Jabez was sufﬁciently master of
himself to descend into the light of the rooms below.
Whatever of surprise or satisfaction Richard Chadwick’s
letter had held for him, a wave of sorrow had passed over soul
and countenance for the sad fate of the parents whom he had
never known. As his footstep was heard overhead, Ellen ﬂew
to meet him at the foot of the staircase, and threw herself into
his arms.
“ My love ! my own husband l” was all she said, but such an
intensity of devotion and sympathy was in the act and tone
that he felt he had indeed a true heart beating with his, as he
held her close, and his lips touched her forehead as a seal to a
new bond.
It was but a single step to the parlour door, which opened
on a room all aglow with light, and radiant faces. On Mr.
Ashton’s inspiriting, Simon’s easy chair had been wheeled in
from the house-place, there being no stately Mrs. Ashton at
hand to demur at the innovation, or to whisper a syllable of class
distinctions. And surely that was not—~yes, it was—Ben Travis
himself standing by the rheumatic old tanner, with both hands
outstretched, to greet a new cousin in his long-time friend.
And there was Bess, proudly glancing from his face to a piece
of yellow paper. “ It’s as like as two peas,” she cried for the
twentieth time, handing to her tall foster-son a sketch which,
though little more than a succession of brown smears, was a
ludicrous resemblance to himself.
“Well, Jabez,” said Mr. Ashton, sitting by the ﬁre, with his
handkerchief over his knee, after the ﬁrst hubbub of congratula—
tion had subsided, “it is as well our new partnership has not
been gazetted. I suppose there will have to be a change of
name, and Ellen there will be Mrs. Travis after all.”

This was but a playful sally on his part, but Ben Travis
visibly winced, and quick-eyed Jabez saw it.
“ No, sir,” replied Jabez, calmly, with his hand on his wife’s
shoulder, “there will be no change. I bear the name of the
kind friends who saved my infant life ; fed, clothed, and kept
me through evil report and good report, through pinching
poverty, privation, and pain ” (he glanced towards Bess) ; “ as
Jabez Clegg I was enrolled as a Blue-coat boy ; as Jabez Clegg
I was apprenticed to you, sir; as Jabez Clegg I married my
wife; as Jabez Clegg I have been honoured with a place in
your ﬁrm; and Jabez Clegg shall go with me to the grave. I
had no name when that good man ” (pointing to Simon) “ lent
me his ; time has made it mine, and I mean to keep it as
honourable as it came to me.” He looked down : “ Mrs. Clegg,
are you content? ”
“ Perfectly, Jabez.”
A long-sustained pinch of snuff spoke Mr. Ashton’s approba-
tion, whilst Simon could only reiterate, “ Eh, lad, when aw tuk
thee eawt o’ the wayter, aw little thowt whatn a blessin’ theaw’d
be to us, or the credit theaw’d bring on ar neame ! Aw nobbut
wish Parson Brucks wur aloive neaw to yer thee.”
“ Our relationship will only bind our friendship closer, what-
ever name you bear,” put in Ben Travis, warmly, in spite of
himself pleased with the decision which would spare him the
pain of addressing Ellen as Mrs. Travis.
“An’ meals come reawnd whatever neame yo’ ca’ them by,”
supplemented Bess, who, like Martha, troubled with much
serving, had been running in and out during the colloquy,
whilst a combination of savoury odours, and a clatter of knives
and plates, came from the'adjoining room ,' “it’s supper toime
neaw, an’ nobbody’s had even theer tay yet.”
“Just so, just so, Mrs. Hulme. But never mind the tea,”
said Mr. Ashton ; “ here comes your good husband in from the
cellar, with a bottle or two of generous wine to drink to new
relationships.”
“I think I shall go abroad for a few months, Cousin Jabez,”
said Travis to him, as Mr. Ashton mounted ﬁrst into the gig to
return home next day. “I require to dissipate thought. If I
were occupied as you are from morning until night there might
be less necessity. But—I say, Chapman the landlord here tells
me you painted this sign. I think the faculty must run in the
blood, for I do a bit in that line myself sometimes. How is it
I have not seen a brush in your hands latterly?”

“ Well, I got a hint, through painting that very sign, that
trade and art were incompatible, and seeing the force of the re-
mark, as counselled—the ‘ cobber has stuck to his last.”’
“ Look you, cousin ” (Travis seemed fond of the word), “the
fabled shield had two sides—stick to your trade if you like, but
don’t let your trade absorb you. A business man who allows
himself no leisure, and has no resource out of his business, is
apt to degenerate into a money-grubber. I hope better things
of you.” ‘
A nod, a shake of . the hand, and the gig rolled off with its
occupants, and Jabez stood looking after them, hesitating
whether to go back to the mill or to the cottage. The casual
word of warning had come not _one whit too soon. That which
was sending Travis abroad had kept Jabez close to business.
He had not sought so much to dissipate thought as to circum-
vent it by substitution. If he had given his leisure to the culti-
vation of art, it had of late been art only as connected with
manufacture and money-making. Even his honeymoon he was
casting into the mill as grist. He was ever ready to take a
hint. He turned his steps towards Carr with something like
a sigh.
“Well, perhaps I might as well give my afternoons to Ellen
whilst we are here. I did not come to work, and the poor thing
does need some compensation for the lack of a lover’s ardour.
God forbid that she should ever suspect that I married her out
of pity, ‘or that I should become a money-grubber. I wonder if
Travis thought I was likely to neglect her? It is a thousand
pities she should set her mind on me instead of him. And why
she should passes my comprehension. He has every advantage
of face, ﬁgure, and fortune, to say nothing of his evident
devotion. Ah ! women are strange creatures, and men are not
much better. I fear I am very ungrateful not to reciprocate
her attachment more fully. Why, here she is running down
the avenue to meet me, as if I had been gone a month. I
really ought to love her better than I do." But love can neither
be forced nor crushed. Heigho 1”

Back to Manchester they went, rather sooner than expected;
and then, though Jabez threw himself into business with a will,
he bore in mind the parting words of Ben Travis.
The contemplated amalgamation was effected, not without
extra draughts on Jabez and his leisure. But as partner of a
large ﬁrm, even though a junior, it was obvious he could not

work as designer for calico-printers, or for any other than their
own house. Consequently, not being a man of pleasure, his
evenings hung rather heavily on his hands, especially as neither
Ellen nor he cared for the card-parties which formed the visit-
ing staple. His very marriage had driven away his closest
friend, and broken in upon plans and schemes which otherwise
would have found sufﬁcient occupation for his spare hours.
Other friends, however; dropped in for an occasional chat ;
notably George Pilkington (to whom the wine-trade had opened
a road to fortune), with his reminiscences and jocularity, broke
in on the monotony of married life, that monotony which is as
much to be dreaded by young couples as is a ﬁrst quarrel.
Ellen knew it not, but Augusta’s image often and often rose
up between husband and wife, and would not be driven back ;
whilst Ellen’s very caresses were a source of pain to him, so
much he felt himself a debtor to her love. There was a void
in his breast which she could never wholly ﬁll; he himself
complained of a dearth of intellectual recreation, and when
Henry Liverseege suggested a return to painting, he fell back
upon his advice. .
The fact is he needed to be alone, to have a place where he
could shut himself up with himself, whether to indulge in day-
dreams or to discipline his soul, or to think out the ideas of
art, trade, or social economy which ﬂoated through his brain,
and were dispersed by actual business or ﬁreside chat ; such a
sanctum as had been his so many years in Mosley Street ; but
self-conscious, he had shrunk from making the proposal, afraid
to wound his devoted wife by showing a desire to isolate him-
self. The young artis‘t’s open remark was enough for Ellen.
At once a small room, or rather closet, partitioned off from a
large one, at the top of the house, was set apart for his use.
He shelved one wall for books, set up an ofﬁce-desk, carried
thither easel, papers, and painting materials; enclosed the ﬂy-leaf
of his father’s prayer-book within glass and a black frame,
suspending it on the wall before him as a sacred relic, and there
after warehouse hours he was wont to shut himself in, and
almost forget that he was a married man. But this room acted
as a safety-valve.
Luckily, in Ellen’s eyes, Jabez could do no wrong ; he was
gentleness itself in all his comportment t0wards her, and the love
which had sprung to life unsought, and lived so_long without
encouragement, asked but slight return to sustain it. It was
treason for Mrs. Chadwick to hint that Jabez was “unsocial,” or

gave them “too little of his company.” She was ever ready to
resent it with the reply that—
“If he is not dull shut up there by himself, I am sure we
three have no right to complain of dullness down here together ;”
yet if we analysed her heart very closely there were longings and
yeamings for his society known only to herself.
It was judged advisable for the further introduction and ex-
tension of Ashton, Chadwick, and Clegg’s business that one of
the partners should travel occasionally as their commercial
representative ; and naturally this duty devolved upon the active
junior, whose capacity for the undertaking revealed itself not
only in heavy remittances and a full order-book, but in apaucity
of bad debts. Of course he travelled with a horse and gig for
the carriage of samples, and now and then he would take Ellen
with him on a short journey, an indulgence which appeared to
ﬁll the cup of her delight. And altogether the marital yoke in
a few months adjusted itself to their shoulders very naturally.
It was during their absence on one of the earliest of these
journeys that an event occurred which set the indignant blood
of Jabez on the boil, and showed there was a ﬁre smouldering,
not extinguished.
The Aspinall home at Fallowﬁeld was an ancient, many-
gabled grange, with mullioned windows, recessed window-seats,
expansive two-leaved entrance arched above ,' noble hall, with
trophies from the hunting-ﬁeld ; grand staircase, with massive
carved oak balusters, ﬂights of broad low steps, and wide square
landings ; long corridors, three or four rooms of magniﬁcent
proportions, and clusters of little ones grouped around un-
suspected passages and stairs ; open ﬁre-places recently en-
closed, and double doors to the chief chambers. Antiquity had
set its seal upon the place, and ﬁlled the panelled rooms with
quaint or obsolete furniture and adomments, as each successive
generation had left its quota. High-backed chairs, sofas of
grotesque device with dim worsted-work cushions and covers,
heavy draperies of silk or velvet, and tables with legs of all
possible patterns.
It had come to the former Mrs. Aspinall from her ancestors,
and from her to her son on his marriage 3 consequently this was
the home proper of Laurence and his wife, although they had
a suite of rooms set apart for them at Ardwick, and Mr.
Aspinall would fain have had his fascinating daughter-in-law
abide there always, instead of making his house a mere con~
vemence for visiting in town.

Stabling and other outhouses were attached, the gardens
were well laid out, there was a good quantity of grass land, all
enclosed within a high wall, and it lay away from the main
road. Mr. Aspinall’s carriage was a close one, for service as
well as show. Mr. Laurence, on his accession to his mother’s
property and his wife’s dowry, added to other extravagances
'not a like carriage, but a new Tilbury, and astonished the
crowd by driving tandem.
Whitsuntide is the great annual festival of Manchester. It
is the race week, the time when the Sunday-school children
dress in their best to walk in procession and have excursional-
treats into the country. In 1823 Whitsunday fell on the 18th
of May, when the hawthorn scented the air, and cherry-
blossom snowed on the carriage which Mr. Aspinall sent for
his daughter~in~law, that she might witness from his drawing-
room windows the interesting spectacle on the Green, and
preside over the hospitalities of his open house during the
week. At that time, as now, Monday was the day set apart
for the children of all the Established Church Schools to as-
semble at the Collegiate Church, sing anthems, and thence
deﬁle in long procession six abreast, attended by their respec-
tive clergy and teachers, until they reached the Green, where
the girls in their white caps and frocks were ranged within the
enclosure of the Pond, the boys forming a dark cordon
around them, and the crowd a motley one beyond. And then
from the multitudinous young throats poured forth anthems
of praise, in a volume of swelling harmony which hushed to
silence the listening birds above them.
Augusta, not in robust health, lay on a couch by the window
and looked on ; her father-in-law watching her and anticipating
her wants with the homage of old world gallantry, for young
Mrs. Aspinall was becoming an important person in his eyes.
Nor was Laurence much less attentive. He had been on
his best behaviour for some time, and would scarcely let the
wind of heaven blow too roughly upon her.
At that period Manchester races were held on Kersall Moor,
an extensive tract of land generously set apart for the purpose
by the owner, Miss Byrom.
“The glass of fashion and the mould of form," was the
handsome man who patted Augusta’s shoulders, and stooped
down to kiss her, on Wednesday, the ﬁrst race day ; but it was
with something more than a shade of anxiety she saw him
draw on his buckskin gloves, take the long reins, and mount

his high Tilbury, with Bob beside him, and dash round the
lower end of the Green at a canter.
Evening came to verify her fears. Back from Kersall Moor
came the tandem and the tandem’s master, but the biped was
ebrz'us. He was in that stage of self-satisﬁed elation which a
contradictory word would change to ﬁerceness, and the whim
of the hour was to drive his wife to Fallowﬁeld, and show her
how dexterous a whip he was, and that not Ducrow could
manage a tandem better than he.
It was in vain she or his father pleaded her delicate health,
‘ the height of the vehicle, the shaking she would sustain; he
laughed at her fears, then ﬁercely insisted, and not daring to
disobey, she was hoisted to her perilous seat.
In much alarm, Mr. Aspinall mounted Bob on a saddle-
horse to follow. The roads were dotted with vehicles and
people, the latter shouting and singing, or muttering tipsy
oaths, as the fortune of the day inclined them. He proved
his dexterity in guiding his far-off leader through all intricacies,
but so close did wheel often come to wheel, that Augusta’s
heart seemed to leap into her throat, and her teeth chattered,
although it was May.
After they turned off from the Stockp0rt Road at Long‘
sight, they “ spun along at a rattling pace,” as he said ; but she
had to hold by the rail to keep her seat, notwithstanding which,
at the sharp angle by Birch Fold, the vehicle gave a lurch
which almost pitched her off. At their own gate there was an
abrupt stoppage for opening, their return being unexpected.
Then the foremost horse refused to obey the rein and center
up the drive. Laurence plied his whip, which did not mend
the matter, and but that Bob and the gardener were there to
soothe the animals, and lead them to the house, worse might
have followed. ‘
As it was, Mrs. Laurence Aspinall was half-dead with fear
and the shaking. She was lifted down and carried, almost in-
sensible, into the house. Cicily and one of the maids got her
to bed, whilst Aspinall himself, calling groom and gardener
from the stables into the drawing-room, sat down to have a
drinking bout with them.
Presently Cicily put a white face in at the door, and
beckoned forth Bob, whom no drink seemed to affect, and
sent him off as fast as four legs could carry him, to bring
back a doctor, and acquaint Mr. Aspinall and the Ashtons
that his young mistress was very ill.

In less time than might have been expected, Mr. Aspinall’s
carriage brought to the Grange that gentleman, Mrs. Ashton,
and Mr. Windsor, a young Quaker practitioner from Piccadilly.
A competent nurse from the Inﬁrmary was on the box.
There was no doubt she was in a critical state, but the
immediate danger was warded off; and though Augusta was
not able to leave her room in the interim, the scent of June’s
roses came in at the open windows before her baby was
born, when penitent Laurence went into raptures over wife
and son. .
For two or three days he hovered about the house, ner-‘
vously anxious lest any sound should disturb the young
mother. He saw that every domestic was shod with list,
stopped the great hall clock, and had the rolled-up carpets
laid down on the polished oaken stairs.
Four days sufﬁced. On the ﬁfth he rode off to town on
Black Ralph on a pretence of business; but very little did
Cannon Street see of Mr. Laurence that day. With every
acquaintance he met was a glass to be drunk, “to wet the
child’s head.” At the Scramble Club, where he dined, he paid
for two or three bottles of wine, also “to wet the child’s head,”
according to the practice of the club. Riding home, he
stopped at the George and Dragon, Ardwick Green, and went
through the same process.
There some one remarked that he was too drunk to stand,
much less ride home, when he swore with an oath that he
would show them how he could ride ; he and Black Ralph
were equal to anything. And then amid roars of derisive
laughter he flung out another oath, and laid a wager which was
regarded merely as the boasting of drunken braggadocio.
He had kissed his wife’s pale lips on leaving in the morning,
_ and she faintly implored him to be home early—she did not
dare add, “ and sober.” Towards nightfall she began to listen
for his return. Hour after hour went by, and at one in the
morning she heard the great gates and the door thrown open
for their impatient master by the watching servants, and the
strong steed come tearing up the gravel—~ay, and on up the
broad, ﬁat steps, Clattering through the great oaken hall, and,
urged with whip and spur, and a madman’s voice, mount the
freshly~carpeted stairs, cross the landing at a stride, and drmng
back the affrighted nurse, enter that sick chamber where, with
her baby at her side, lay the fair young wife, gasping and
shrinking with terror, and there stand with quivering ﬂanks and

panting nostrils, as the reckless rider on his back cried in equ-
tation—
“ By G—d, I’ve done it 1”
He had done it! No matter what noise acc0mpanied the
removal of horse and rider, the wife, whom in his sober hours
he professed to love so passionately lay insensible to sight or
sound, and wakened only to a morrow of delirium.

wounns INFLICTED AND ENDURED.
HE spark lies cold in the ﬂint until it is struck ,- and Ellen
had not believed her quiet husband capable of so
much passionate indignation as burst from him on the receipt
(at Sheﬁield) of the details just given.
“Brute! ruﬂian!” burst from his lips, as the letter he had
crushed in his grasp fell to the ﬂoor; and with a stamp he
rose to his feet, pressed one hand across his knitted brows, and
paced the dingy carpet from end to end in a state of restless
perturbation, his wrath ﬁnding vent in epithets and invectives
foreign to his tongue.
“ Whatever is the matter, Jabez, love ?” Ellen asked in
amazement.~
“Oh, Ellen, clear! that brute Aspinall ” He could get
no further. Feeling choked his utterance.
She picked up the crumpled letter, and with almost equal
exasperation and pain made herself mistress of its contents, in
her womanly indignation and love for her cousin losing sight
of her husband’s excessive emotion.
Jabez left his journey unﬁnished, and drove back home with
all speed. Ellen shared with Mrs. Ashton and her own mother
the anxious watch in that large dim room, where the favourite
of the family tossed her head from side to side, and muttered
incoherent words.
In the sudden emergency, Bob the old groom’s recommen-
dation of his own daughter as a wet-nurse for the poor frail
baby passed without cavil. Not until long afterwards was it
known that Sarah Mostyn was the last woman to have entered
that house, and on such a footing.
One month, two months wore out before Augusta rallied, and
Mr. Windsor, whose medical creed was to “let nature take its
course,” pronounced her out of danger, and ﬁt for the removal

contemplated by her friends, and resisted by Laurence.
Double doors, however, could not exclude outer_sounds, and
so long as she shrank and shuddered at every crunch on the
gravel, every echo of his raised voice, recovery was retarded.
So the elder Mr. Aspinall, exasperated with his son, and most
solicitous for the welfare of his son’s charming wife, added his
dictum to that of the doctor, offered his own carriage for her
conveyance, and threatened to disinherit Laurence if he inter-
fered.
Once in her childhood’s home she amended rapidly, but with
1ncreasing strength came maternal yearnings for her infant, still
in charge of the wet-nurse at Fallowﬁeld. A hackney-coach
was sent to bring Sarah Mostyn with the, Child to its mother ;
but not a step would the nurse budge. She had no orders
from her master, and the master paid her wages, and she,
“shouldna tak’ orders from annybody else.” Messages were
sent, and notes were written to Laurence, which he tore to
shreds; but ‘he kept away from his wife, and kept back the
child.
At length she pined so much for her “dear babe,” that Mr.
Ashton and Jabez together sought Laurence out in one of his
haunts (a tavern near Cockpit-Hill), to prevail on him to let
Augusta have her boy with her.
“Mrs. Aspinall herself deserted her child,” he replied, all
the more haughtily that jabez was Mr. Ashton’s seconder.
“ When Mrs. Aspinall thinks ﬁt to return home to her maternal
and wifely duties, she will ﬁnd the nursery door.open, and her
son in trustworthy care. A true wife’s place is by her husband’s
hearth.” -
“ Yes, sir, when the husband is a true man,” replied Jabez,
with decision.
“And who dares to say I am not a true man?” retorted
Laurence boldly.
“I do l” promptly answered the other. “ No true man
would have imperilled his wife’s life by a reckless drive in the
dark night in a tandem Tilbury ! Only a reckless madman or
a rufﬁan would have forced a horse into a wife’s sick-chamber,
to drive her delirious with terror 1 ”
“And pray, sir, haughtily responded the other, “how long
has Mrs. Aspinall made you her conﬁdant? ” .
“ I have not the honour of Mrs. Aspinall’s conﬁdence,” an~
swered Jabez sturdily, looking him full in the face 5 “such facts
are trumpet-tongued."


## p. 327 (#339) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 327
"Just so,” put in Mr. Ashton, drawing his arm through that
of his junior partner. “ And the fact that Augusta shrinks at
your name has spoken so loudly to us that if ever 'she sits on
your hearth again it won’t be with my consent—Come
away, Clegg.”
After this declaration, Aspinall changed his tactics. He
wrote to his wife, requesting her return ; then entreating it,-
and ﬁnally went in person to beseech her to “come back,”
vowing to “ atone for the past with the devotion of a life.”
The young mother yearned for her babe, the tender-hearted
wife could not resist the appeal of the husband whom with all
his faults she yet loved; and, regardless of the previsions of
her mother, or the entreaties of her father, she allowed him to
drive her home again to the Grange.
Her ﬁrst thought was the nursery. There she found, in
addition to her own boy, drawing its sustenance from the nurse’s
breast, a well-dressed child, some two years old, playing with a
wooden milkmaid-rattle on the rug. Something in the child’s
face and auburn curls made her ask, “Sarah, whose child is
that P ”
“Mine. Whose should it be?” was the pert answer; and
the boldness of the woman’s manner checked further inquiry.
But Augusta’s heart had received a shock which shook the
pedestal on which her idol sat enthroned.
For a short pace Laurence kept terms with his wife; and
before her father or strangers he was her most devoted slave ;
but she underwent a species of slow torture in secret.
She soon found that Sarah Mostyn was mistress of the house
as well as of the nursery, and that Sarah Mostyn’s child was
of as much importance as her own baby-boy.
Then he ﬁlled the Grange with his riotous associates, and
compelled his wife to do the honours of his table, though their
oaths and conversation overpowered her with disgust. And if
one ﬂushed with wine, or more bold than the rest, paid her a
compliment, or looked too warm an admiration, Laurence was
sure to ﬁnd his way to her side with his common undertone
threat—“ D n you, madam, you shall smart for this !”——a
threat always accompanied with sly pinches, which left their
marks beneath her sleeves. Then, straightway, “ my dear,” or
“my love ” would be asked, in the blandest of tones, to sing
a song, play a rondo, or perform some act of courtesy for the
very guest who had excited his jealousy.
They had few lady visitors. The neighbourhood was remote

from town, and sparsely inhabited. .Mr. Laurence Aspinall’s
reputation was as a yellow ﬂag to warn gentlewomen who had
daughters or husbands to lose against close intimacy with their
neighbours of the Grange. Pitying the isolation of one so
formed to adorn society, Mr. Aspinall gave mixed parties at
Ardwick Green, in the name of Mrs. Laurence, when the
splendour of her attire and the assiduous attention of her
husband set rumour to contradict rumour. But save on'an
occasional family gathering, she saw few of her own sex at
Fallowﬁeld.
And her position in her own home was rendered intolerable
by the continued presence of Sarah Mostyn, who at ﬁrst
familiar, then impertinent, had become at last openly deﬁant.
It was not until all efforts to keep the nurse in her proper
place had failed, that Augusta appealed to Laurence to discharge
her, the woman having refused to take a dismissal from anyone
but her master.
“ Tchut!” said he, “I’ll soon settle that business!” and forth-
with stalked to the nursery, whence his voice was heard in loud
command ; but the result was not the woman’s removal, only a
temporary submission, to be followed by fresh rebellion, and
the conﬁrmation of Augusta’s worst suspicions. How often
did the aggrieved wife then recall her thoughtless declaration to
her mother, that her “ husband’s heart must hold lzer and lzer
only,” not even business to share in its possession I And how
thankful she would have been to have had no rival then but
business ! She was ﬁnding the bed she had made for herself a
wofully hard one ,- but she did not succumb readily, she had
high spirits and a buoyant nature, and would hardly admit to
herself how much she suffered or how great a mistake she had
made.
But Cicily, that most faithful of faithful followers, cognisant
of her mistress’s wrongs long before her mistress, paid Sarah
Mostyn off in her own coin on various occasions, and took
care that through one means or other the Ashtons should know
what a life their darling led.
Amongst his other little peculiarities Mr. Laurence was an
epicure ; and one of his favourite tid-bits was that spongy lining
of a goose’s frame known as the soul. It chanced at a family
dinner, rather more than a year after Augusta’s return home,
that a ﬁne stubble goose formed part of the bill of fare ,' and
Cicily, who had long owed him a grudge for his heartless treat-
ment of her young mistress, determined to pay him off, and

expose him before the whole company. A good caterer for a
dainty palate, Cicily knew her power and privileges, but in this
case she overshot the mark. ‘
_ One of the accomplishments of that generation was dexterous
carving, and Laurence prided himself on being able to dis-
member a large fowl without once shifting his fork. The goose
was set before himself, and duly helped, but, 10 ! when his knife
would fain have extracted his favourite morsel it scraped bare
bones.
The ﬂat bell-rope was pulled violently. Cicily was sum-
moned, and Cicily, in clean linen cap and apron, stood in the
- doorway curtseying respectfully.
“What have you done with the soul of this goose P” he de-
manded, in a tone of suppressed passion.
Cicily came a step or two forward with an aspect of mar>
vellous innocence. “ Eh, sir, it’s not a goose, it’s a gonder, and
genders have no souls.”
Scarcely an individual present but took the covert inuendo,
and glances were exchanged across the board ,' but the look he
shot at the woman as, incapable of speech, he waved her to
retire, was one never to be forgotten, so much demoniac wrath
was concentrated therein.
From the time when Jabez was acknowledged on ’Change as
a Manchester man, was admitted into Manchester “society,”
and had absolutely become a member of the same family as
his son, Mr. Ashton punctiliously invited him with his-wife ,'
and Laurence, with widely different feelings followed suit.
It was not until after the noble exploit to which Augusta so
nearly fell a sacriﬁce that Mr. Clegg could be induced so far to
listen to Ellen’s desire for conciliation, “ now that they were all
of one family,” as to accept one of these invitations. After
that event he was of Mrs. Ashton’s mind that, “ as offenders
never pardon,” Augusta needed a friend to watch over her. So
he left his books, and his brushes, and his schemes for the
class amongst whom he had been reared, and (believing his
growing affection for his wife, and the babe she had borne him,
a sufﬁcient guarantee to his own heart for his own good faith,)
when the Aspinalls next invited, he accepted.
As previously stated, Augusta had not dropped into tame
submission all at once ; her old wilfulness would have way at
times ,' and the light shafts of her satire were frequently aimed
with effect against her recalcitrant 10rd. More than once Jabez
had averted disastrous consequences by checking her vivacity

ere it went too far. But never had he been so thankful for his
self-appointed guardianship as on the night when Cicily thought
to pay back her darling’s wrongs.
To his surprise and pleasure, Ben Travis, just returned from
the Continent, was of the party. He had not yet called on the
family in Oldham Street, and Jabez never asked him wherefore.
The cousins had much to talk over, and whilst Laurence
Aspinall was pouring wine on his wrath, they discussed a pro-
ject in which Jabez took an interested part, and which even-
tuated the following year in the Manchester Mechanics’ Institu-
tion. But through all their discussion Jabez never once lost
sight pof Laurence, and from his excessively polite manner to
her he augured ill for Augusta when the restraining presence of
friends was removed. He communicated his fears to Travis
and when the good-byes were said, and the various conveyances
rolled out of the great gates, a fee to Luke the gardener, who
was also gatekeeper, kept them open. A whispered word was
sufﬁcient for those who had seen the look Laurence directed
across the dinner-table from Cicily to his wife, and who knew
the character and disposition of the man.
Mr. Travis’s gig and the Ashton’s hackney-coach were kept
in waiting close at hand, Mrs. Ashton and Ellen, well wrapped
up within, waiting anxiously for they knew not what.
Back towards the closed house went Mr. Ashton and the
cousins, treading carefully over the gravel. There was a flagged
footway round the building, and from the windows of dining
and drawing-rooms lights were still streaming. The last owner
had lowered the middle window of the drawing-room as a door
of access to the lawn.
As if by accident the curtains had been dragged a little aside
in each apartment, and now there were watchers at the apertures.
The elder Mr. Aspinall had made an excuse and retired to bed
early. Augusta, with a shawl wrapped round her, sat weeping
on a sofa in the drawing-room, afraid to go to bed. High
words had evidently passed whilst those outside had made their
arrangements at the gate. ~
Presently, into the dining-room sauntered Laurence, with his
arm round the shoulders of Sarah Mostyn the shameless nurse.
They sat down to the supper table ,- he poured out wine into
a goblet, and they drank from the same glass, he fed her with
delicacies, and kissed and caressed her with an assured
familiarity which told it was no new experience.
Long they lingered drinking and dallying, and the watchers

might have thought no danger need be apprehended. Suddenly
a word of the woman’s, like a match to petroleum, set the whole
man ablaze. He rushed from the room with a loud oath, the
woman after him, apparently in alarm. The movement her
friends made outside in gaining the other window caused
Augusta to raise her beautiful head, and at that moment her
husband stood before her, brandishing his cavalry sabre, and
with his eyeballs glaring, ﬁercely vociferating, “I’ll teach you
madam, to set my servants to insult me I” he made a fearful
slash at her. -
As she sprang aside with a terriﬁed shriek, the old woodwork
of the glass-door gave way, and before the tipsy madman could
recover his guard to strike a fresh blow, his sabre was wrenched
from him, and himself struggling in the grasp of three powerful
men, his own gardener being one.
Poor Mr. Ashton’s care was his stricken child, whose white
shoulders, bathed in blood, were washed by a father’s tears.
Thankful then was Jabez to have been at hand, and on the
alert, with so powerful an ally as Travis; thankful to have
saved Augusta’s life at any sacriﬁce of personal feeling; and
only himself could tell what his presence under that roof cost
him.
Even Laurence had no inkling of it 5 the marriage of Jabez
had closed his jealous eyes. But now, ﬁnding in his old oppo-
nent an unseen watcher over his wife—her defender when he
had least expected—his baﬁled rage was something terrible to
look upon. He fought, struggled, vociferated, threatened, and
foamed at the mouth; and Mr. Aspinall, coming thither in his
dressing-gown, aroused by the uproar, could barely master his
indignation and disgust as he ordered the men-servants, crowd-
ing in half-dressed, to “help to bind that murderous maniac
down ! ”
It was well, too, that Mrs. Ashton and Ellen were close at
hand, and a vehicle ready to despatch for a surgeon, for
Augusta needed all their care. _
Before three days were over there was a little cofﬁn in the
house, holding a still-born child, and there was a young mother,
with a plaistered shoulder, lying, white as her pillow, 1n 8- state
of coma. _
Dr. Windsor having exercised his best skill, as was his wont
left nature to do the rest, and youth and nature, between them,
did their work effectually.
Fain would Mr. Ashton have removed his child once and for

all. He offered to set up a carriage for her, if she would but
leave her husband, and seek a legal separation, insisting that
she owed a duty to herself, as well as to her husband. Mr.
Aspinall himself begged that she would take up her abode with
him, at Ardwick, if only for her own security. He had ceased
to ﬁnd excuses for his son, and his son’s charming wife stood
high in his esteem.
But Laurence had been“ beforehand, and with plausible
promises and penitential tears, and an adroit parade of her
little Willie, also in tears “for mamma,” won her over to par-
don, and to give him another trial ,- and not all Mr. Ashton’s
eloquence, or Mrs. Ashton’s proverbial battery, could win her
from her decision.
“ My dear mother,” said she, “ remember you told me
‘what could not be cured must be endured,’ and that ‘ as I
made my bed so must I lie.’ It is a long lane, mother, that
has never a turn, I have heard you say many a time,- and who
knows but Laurence may take a turn now, and reform? At all
events, it is my duty to give him a fair trial, and keep my own
wayward nature in check, so as not to provoke him ; and I
must not leave Willie‘alone with that woman. I think Mr.
Clegg would say I am right.”
I am afraid she overrated Mr. Clegg’s magnanimity much as
she overrated her wild husband’s promised reformation, for her
decision struck a pang in the heart of Jabez little dreamed of
by Ellen. Indeed, it cost him a sore struggle to subdue his
concern for Augusta within the bounds of duty to his own wife,
whose many virtues were gradually winning their way into his
heart. and towards whom his attention never relaxed.

CHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH.
THE MOWER WITH His scvrms.
EARS went by—Laurence had promised to remove Sarah
Mostyn, but the woman laughed, refused to stir, and he
let her remain—a thorn in his wife’s side—training up the boy
she had nursed, and whom he idolised, to scorn and jeer at his
own mother ; whilst her red-haired girl ran wild about the
place as a young hare. He broke out from time to time, and
his wife was the sufferer ; he horse-whipped her, shot at her,
and tortured her in every way that malignity could devise.
No wonder that so many tiny cofﬁns of immature babes
should be carried from the gates of the Fallowﬁeld Grange.
No wonder if Augusta began to compare her lot with Ellen’s,
and to repent her scorn of a true heart because of its plebeian
origin.
Meanwhile, the ﬁrm of Ashton, Chadwick, and Clegg pros-
pered beyond expectation, the business tact and integrity of the
junior partner alike aiding the extension and stability of the
ﬁrm. To make way for its expansion more warehouse room
was required. The Ashtons, not without a sigh for old asso-
ciation, relinquished their house, and removed to another close
at hand in George Street, little less commodious, however
much Kezia might grumble at it. This was when Ben Travis,
lacking employment for time, mind, and money, offered them
to the growing establishment, and his inﬂuence as “ Co.” was
accepted. This combination of capital and energy, as Iabez
had foreseen, worked wonders for them commercially, enabling
them to tide over the trade distress of 1826 with security and
advantage. Long before then Jabez had offered to pay Mrs.
Clowes her loan, with interest ; but she told him she was going
to render up her account where, not the coin she had, but that
which she had given away, would be put to her credit; and
so, as at ﬁrst proposed, she made it over to lgr little god-

son, Joshua Clegg, before she was gathered to the great
garner.
But the universal mower reaped a heavier harvest in 1828,
when he swept his keen scythe over the bed of the river.
In 1822 Mr. Ashton (one of the ﬁrst promoters of the
Chamber of Commerce), notwithstanding his advancing years,
took an active part in the formation of a New Quay Company,
for the better navigation of the river Irwell. The company
was established, quays were constructed, warehouses erected,
boats built, trafﬁc was extended, and the town generally bene-
ﬁted. ’ i
\ In the February of 1828 the axe, the adze, and the hammer -
made a busy noise in the boat-building yard of the company, '
and sail-makers were active with their needles ,- for a ﬂat,
' destined to convey cargoes of merchandise to and from Liver-
pool, was to be ready for the launch on the 26th, a day destined
to send a thrill of horror tingling through the veins of Man- _
chester, so sad was the catastrophe it closed upon.
The launch of the Emma was an event in the annals of the
company, and of the town ,- consequently a large number of
spectators assembled, a goodly proportion being admitted to the
yard to take part in the ceremony, and go with the ﬂat on her
trial trip under Captain Gaudy.
Mrs. Ashton, saying, “that when the cat’s away the mice will _
play,” had decided on remaining at .home to watch the mice,
but Mr. Ashton compensated himself by taking Ellen and her
two eldest boys, leaving baby with its grandma ; Jabez, detained
by business in the counting~house, promising to overtake them
before they were on board. Mr. Aspinall, too, was there, and
on his arm was his son’s wife, and Laurence, with his boy Willie,
close beside them. He was too jealous of the admiration she
excited, to permit her to go into company, even with his father,
unless he had also his own eye upon her, especially where there
was a chance of meeting Jabez Clegg. He brought the boy for
a treat.
It was quite a gala-day, and as the pleasant company mounted
the deck, peered into the cabin, and chatted gaily to one
another, they little thought to how many that would be a launch
into eternity.
The boat, a large ﬂat, fully rigged, painted white above the
water-line, and black below, with sails set and ﬂags ﬂying,
rested in well-greased cradles, her head down ; the shipwrights
stood ready with their daggers,- painters with their cans and

brushes to dab her sides as she slid past them; a band upon
the quay played lively tunes, and (fatal mischance) the people
on deck ﬂocked to one side to listen. The sponsor, a Miss
Grimes, with her sister and our friends, advanced to the bows
The word was given ; the ready daggers struck away the shores;
the boat began to move ; Miss Grimes caught ﬁrmly the bottle
(suspended by a. ribbon), and shattered it upon the vessel, pro-
claiming, with that baptism of wine, the boat was henceforth
the Emma. Hurrahs and exclamations followed. The bows
touched the water, which ﬁrst splashed the faces,then lifted from
their feet the christeners and the Ashton party. The ﬂat had
differ! toe deeply, it heeled over on her crowded side, and ran/e
with her living cargo clinging and fettering each other in the
swirling waters, whilst shrieking spectators looked on helpless
from bridge and bank, watching others braver and bolder, or
better skilled, rush to the rescue to their own risk.
Who shall picture the horror and confusion of that moment,
when some scores of holiday people—men, women, children—
were precipitated at one fell swoop into the water, shrieking
and clinging to one another with that tenacity of grip proverbial
with the drowning?
The bridge, the Old Quay, the open space in front of the
New Bailey Prison—railed off at an elevation far above the
stream—the steep steps, and the towing-path beneath, were all
lined with spectators, though the fatal launch was made from a
yard lower down the river on the Manchester side. (The New
Bailey is in Salford).
As the vessel struck the ground, shuddering from stem to
stern, before turning over on her side, and the ﬁnal catastrophe
was imminent, Laurence (sober for once) snatched his darling
\ boy up in his arms, whispered a hasty word of instruction and
conﬁdence, and, regardless of aught besides, sprang with him
into the water in the contrary direction, far as possible beyond
the eddy and suction, and keeping clear of the struggling
wretches who were pulling each other down, swam with him to
the towing-path. But not until he had placed Willie under
safe charge, beyond danger from the scurrying throng, did he
hasten back to attempt the rescue of wife or father ,- and then
neither was to be seen. '
Mr. Aspinall had been an able swimmer in his day, and made
a bold-effort for self~preservation ; but cramp seizing his gouty
limbs, he was one of the ﬁrst to disappear and perish, though
boats and swimmers had put out to the general rescue.

It was vain to search for individuals ; though well was his son’s
prowess tested that day 3 more than one drowning wretch he
clutched from behind by clothes or hair, and urged forward to
the bank, where the Humane Society’s men, with ropes and
grapnels, were ably seconded by volunteer humanity, and strong
hands were outstretched to haul the helpless up. .
Ben Travis had waited for Jabez, detained in the warehouse
by courtesy to Mr. Gregson, the buyer for Messrs. Leaf of
London, and the two, hurrying to make up for lost time, only
reached the New Quay with Nelson at their heels as the hurrahs
died out in appalling screams, and the waters of . the Irwell
closed over all the twain held dearest in life.
With the celerity of light, coats were doﬁ'ed and shoes cast
off, and the two leaped from the stone quay in hope and dread,
but the good dog was before them, its teeth in a child’s coat,
swimming to the shore. Almost as Jabez touched the water, a
sinking woman clutched his legs. With a plunge he freed him-
self, then catching at her long hair, towed her behind him to
the side, and swam back to seek and save his own wife and
little ones, if that were possible.
A ﬂoating scarf, a mass of matchless brown curls, a hand and
arm above the water, and Jabez knew that Augusta Aspinall
was sinking there before him. A few strokes brought him to
the spot; he dived; a youth was clinging to her shirts, and
held her down. One or both must have drowned. With a
blow which went to his heart, he freed her, and, catching her
beneath the armpit, held her well from him as he made for
shore. To the Humane Society’s men he yielded her—so far
gone, the men shook their heads over the lovely woman, as
though she were beyond help. But they bore the dripping lady
to the sail-room close at hand, whilst Jabez, taking the pre-
caution to secure a rope to his waist, plunged boldly into the
midst of the entangled mass in quest of his own.
It was a vain search ; he brought one strange child, and then
another to bank, and then a man ; but he was again laid hold
of when his strength was exhausted; and only for the pre-
cautionary rope, he would have given to the greedy river the
life Simon Clegg had saved from it.
Travis had the good fortune to rescue Mr. Ashton, but he
had been some time in the water, and the old man was far
spent 3 but there was no trace of Ellen or her boys, even though
he dived close by the sunken ﬂat, and brought up lifeless bodies
in their stead.

Jabez and he could only hope some other of the brave men,
putting their own lives in peril, had saved them.
The governor of the gaol had opened his house doors, the
recovered dead were carried into the gaol itself, the sail-maker’s
room was crowded, every tavern near was ﬁlled, but no trace
was found of Ellen or their sons, and Jabez was like one dis-
traught.
He was but one agitated atom in that seething, surging,
frantic crowd, where women shrieked for their husbands, parents
for their children, children for their parents ; where passing
strangers threw themselves into the water to save life, and lost
their own ; where ignorance lifted the hapless by the heels “to
pour the water out ” and extinguished the last spark of vitality;
and where yelping dogs astray were caught and slaughtered,
that medical skill might transfuse the warm blood of the lesser
animal into the veins of the human, as a last resource to restore
suspended animation. Even gallant old Nelson narrowly
escaped falling a sacriﬁce to the surgeons.
Jabez entered the room where Augusta Ashton was lying, to
all appearance, dead—ordinary means of resuscitation having
failed ; and a surgeon was about so to operate on her from
a bleeding spaniel on the ground. Jabez shrank with a strange
loathing; in an instant bared his arm to the doctor’s lancet;
and if he did not give his life to serve her, as he had once said,
he gave his life’s blood to save her ; and as the warm ﬂuid
passed from his quick veins to hers, he saw the blue quivering
lids tremble, light pass into the brown eyes, breath part the
blue lips once more; arid from the depths of his anguished
heart he thanked God as a faint “ Jabez ” indicated recognition
as well as returning animation.
He had restored a wife to thankless Aspinall ; but who
should restore to him the darling boys who had crept about his.
knees and round his heart, and the good wife who had won a
place there, in spite of fate, by her own patient, but intense,

The Emma was raised and ﬂoated, so little damaged that
she was speedily ready for use, and continued so for many
years. In her cabin were found the remains of Ellen and her
sons, where the childish curiosity of the elder one had doubt-
less led all three ; but they were raised from the water only to
be committed to the earth, and covered up out of sight and
hearing for evermore ; and never did Jabez know fully all she
had become to him until he stood with Travis by the side of an

open grave, and heard the clods rattle on the cofﬁn-lid. She
was all as one then to the man who had worshipped her, and
the man she had worshipped; and though the babe she had
left behind was nearer to the one, it would be hard to say to
which little Nelly was the dearest in the aftertime.
Including the bodies found beneath the ﬂat and those laid
out in the gaol and elsewhere for inquest, thirty-three lives were
sacriﬁced on the altar of the Emma ; and of these must be
reckoned the brave men who cast their lives away to rescue
others. .
Among the early saved were the Captain, Miss Grimes, and
her sister, the two latter being hastily conveyed home in a
private carriage (mayhap Mr. Aspinall’s), with coats and cloaks
wrapped around their saturated garments.
Good, kind, genial Mr. Ashton never recovered from the
effects of his long immersion. He was a man far advanced in
years, and the shock was too much for him. He hobbled about
the warehouse, snuff-box in hand, a few months, and then
dropped asleep in his easy-chair after a game of cribbage with
Jabez—never to wake again.
And then the excitement and agitation consequent on the
loss of his dear Ellen and her romping boys having brought on
Mr. Chadwick a fresh attack of paralysis, which left him still
more helpless (though he survived many years to pet and spoil
Ellen’s baby-girl), Mrs. Ashton, lonely in her large house, pro-
posed that her sistei’s family (Jabez included) should join her
in George Street; but when she would have said “the more
the merrier,” the words died on her lips. Who were they but
the survivors of two wrecked households ?
After a little hesitation the offer was accepted, and the
whole family gathered in their shorn proportions under one roof.
But there was another proposition from another quarter, to
which there was considerably more demur. Mrs. Hulme, in a
warm grey-duffel cloak, for the preservation of her new mourn-
ing, travelled from Whaley-Bridge, to ask as a favour that baby
Nelly should be committed to her care.
“You see, Mrs. Chaddick, th’ poor little babby’ll thrive
better yond than here i’ th’ smooak; an’ aw’d fain do summat
for Mester Clegg, he have done so much fur feyther an ”
Iabez interrupted her.
“ Hush ! Mrs. Hulme. I owe life and all that life has given
to your father and yourself. What little I have done in return
has been but dust in the balance. Yet as it is your desire, and

I know baby would be best in your hands, if grandmother will
consent to part with her, Nelly and her nurse shall go back
with you for the coming summer months.”
And so, though parting with Ellen’s baby seemed parting
with Ellen over again, the little blossom went away to other
blossoms on the healthy hill-side.
Tom Hulme was no longer overlooker, but responsible
manager at the Whaley-Bridge Mill, with a good salary 3 and if
Jabez gratefully traced his fortune back to his cradle, so too
did they trace their amended position to the same source. But
Bess more immediately referred to the beneﬁt Simon Clegg had
derived from the Buxton Baths, whither Jabez had sent him
year after year, for the relief of his rheumatism, and to his care
of steadfast little Sim. He had ﬁrst placed the crippled lad
with a doctor celebrated for his treatment of bodily deformities,
under whom the boy’s bent body had strengthened and
straightened considerably, and then removed him for education
to the house of a married clergyman, where there were no
rough boys to torment him. Jabez knew well what were the
amenities of public schools.

CHAPTER Tl-IE FORTY-SEVENTH.
THE LAST ac'r.
HE catastrophe which deprived Laurence Aspinall of a
father, and had almost robbed him of a loving, patient ~
wife, would have steadied any man less reckless and selﬁsh
than he. But that he should rescue strangers, and Jabez save
his wife, and that through transfusion the blood of Jabez should
course through Augusta’s veins, formed a combination of mis-
chances beyond parallel, and the honey was changed to gall.
Nay, he was graceless enough to exclaim, in the ﬁrst burst of
his jealous rage, “ I would rather she had died outright than
have that fellow triumph in her restoration through his means.
D him !”
And yet there were times when in his uxorious fondness he
wholly persuaded himself, and half persuaded her, that his very
extravagances arose from excess of love !
His fancied wrongs culminated when ﬁrst the will of his
father, and after a brief period that of Augusta’s father, were
read and proved. .
The former set forth that, disgusted with the ungentleman-
like excesses of his son, and convinced that his course of lavish
extravagance would end in penury, he had determined to settle
on~ his son’s wife, Augusta Aspinall, for her sole use and beneﬁt,
the house and premises on Ardwick Green, with all therein
contained, together with a sufﬁcient sum in the funds to main-
tain a beﬁtting state ; in the event of her decease, the reversion
to pass to any child or children she had or might hereafter
bear to his son Laurence. To him he left the residue of his
means, and the old business in Cannon Street, with a charge
to apply himself to merchandise.
The latter will, though equally stringent, was a much more
prolix affair. After a number of legacies, of which Jabez came
in for onapo, Mr. Ashton bequeathed to his wife all other proper-



## p. 341 (#353) ############################################

The Manchester Man. 341
ties whatsoever he died possessed of, together with half his
share in the ﬁrm of Ashton, Chadwick, Clegg, and Co. ; the
other half to his beloved daughter, limiting the annual sum she
was to draw from the ﬁrm, and which was in nowise to pass
into the hands of her depraved husband; and Jabez Clegg and
Benjamin Travis were appointed executors for the due perform-
ance of its provisions.
Imagine the excitement and jealous fury of Laurence Aspin-
all on thus being set aside even by his own father and super-
seded by his wife ; and as if that were not sufﬁcient degrada-
tion, to have Jabez Clegg, whose charity-school face yet bore
the impress of his foot, set as his wife’s executor, to dole out
what he called a “pittance” where he had anticipated a for-
tune !
It so happened that the early duties of his executorship
called Jabez once or twice unexpectedly to Fallowﬁeld, and
that on each occasion the master of the mansion was from
home.
It might be that the river had washed the roses from
Augusta’s cheeks so effectually that her complexion had never
regained its tone ; or it might be that her skin looked white in
contrast with the blackness of her bombazine and crape 3 cer-
tain it was that Jabez was struck with the pallor of her counte-
nance, and his inquiry, “ Are you not well, Mrs. Aspinall? ”
was tinctured with alann.
As a light ﬂush tinged her cheek, then faded away again, and
she received him with a timid indecision very unlike her former
girlish freedom, :1 sense of her almost supernal loveliness
brought something of the old ache into his heart, and out of
respect for himself and her, he hurried over his business, and
having obtained the signatures for which he came, mounted his
gig and drove back to town, haunted by look, and voice, and
manner.
Yet in the integrity of his own heart he had no conception
that her embarrassment was the result of fear—fear of the inter-
pretation her jealous madman of a husband should put on so
unwonted a visit.
He thought he saw a smile of malice in the corners of the
mouth of the bold woman who met him in the hall, and nodded
to him so freely as he passed her on his way out ; but no pre-
scient spirit whispered in his ear that his twenty minutes’ visit
on absolute business would furnish envy and jealousy with a
pretext for foul-mouthed slander, for coarse vituperation, for the

use of a whip, and for calumnious accusations which cut deeper
than its lash.
Cicily, who intervened to save her mistress, might have con-
veyed some inkling of this to Mrs. Ashton, but Augusta abso-
lutely forbade her sympathetic servant’s interference.
“You would do no good, Cicily,” she said ; “the evil is be-
yond earthly remedy ; you would only distress my dear mother
to no purpose, and she has suffered too much on my account
already. It cannot last for ever !”
On the next occasion Jabez was accompanied by his joint-
executor, but even that fact did not save Augusta from her hus-
band’s wrath, and his vile aspersions went far to drive out the
last lingering sentiment of affection or regard she had for him.
But she clung to her child, and that bound her to her home
and him whom in an evil hour she had chosen ; though tears
fell bitterly on Willie’s curly head, when he, like his father, gave
her back blows for kisses. And if at times her conscience
smote her for her haughty repulse of Jabez by the stair-foot
window at Carr Cottage, what wonder? Had not Laurence
himself scored his rejected rival’s name on her heart with his
braces and whip-lash P
She shut the obtrusive memory out with a shudder, and,
dropping on her knees, prayed earnestly for strength to bear
and to forbear.
Yet much of the cruelty of Laurence at this time arose from
another source than causeless jealousy. He had been living
far beyond his private means, and was greatly involved. He
had calculated on laying his hand on a good round sum, and
was disappointed. In order, however, to raise the needful, he
sold his father’s old-established concern to their head clerk,
far below its value. On the Fallowﬁeld estate his friend
Barret held a mortgage; and had it been possible, he would
similarly have disposed of Augusta’s possessions. Here, how»
ever, he was doubly bafﬂed, and he turned on her as the
primary cause.
The old law which preserved the woman’s absolute right over
properties legally settled upon herself, by strange anomaly did
not secure to her one guinea of the coin those properties pro-
duced.
Well did Jabez watch over Augusta’s interest, but his heart
ached as he saw her sad countenance, and the greedy triumph-
ant eyes of ever-present Laurence when her dividends were paid
in. For, before his very face, Laurence laid his hand upon the

money, to squander it as he had squandered his own on Sarah
Mostyn and other dissolute companions, leaving his wife with-
out so much as would purchase a pocket-handkerchief.
Then, lest she should make her wrongs known, he kept her
aclose prisoner at F allowﬁeld, and for all the pleasure she had
of her Ardwick mansion, she might as well have been without
it.
No wonder if each fresh act of personal violence snapped
some bond between them, until the only one link to bind her to
life and her husband was her boy Willie 5 whilst the only human
trait of Laurence was his fondness for his son, whom he was
rapidly ruining with false indulgence, as he himself had been
ruined.
It was customary, when the hay-making season came round,
for Laurence to gather such friends as his wife or he retained—
the married with their children—for a frolic in the hay-ﬁelds,
and the bringing home the last waggon-load in triumph to
crown or inaugurate a feast.
On these occasions he had the grace or the diplomacy to
keep Sarah Mostyn in the background, though she ﬂaunted
boldly enough about the house in the presence of his wife, and
her child mingled with the children.
The harvest-home of 1831 was attended with the customary
festivities, Willy, a rough playmate, was half smothering Nelly
Clegg in the hay, or chasing the Walmsleys amongst the hay-
cocts, until the last load was ready, and then the boy insisted
that he and his companions should be mounted atop. Shouts
and cheers announced their coming to the party in the drawing-
roon ; they came crowding to the windows, and the glass-door
beirg open, one or two sauntered out on to the ﬂagged walk.
Merrily they came along the gravelled drive, under the hot sun,
dreaning of no danger, Willie clapping his hands and calling,
“Look at us, papa,” when, right in front of the drawing-room
window, the pin which held the body of the cart down, by some
means became displaced, the cart tilted up, and hay and children
were sent ﬂying.
Beyond a few bruises, none of the children were injured but
one; they had fallen amongst hay, or on the spongy lawn; but
Wilie, the one jewel in the Aspinall casket pitched with his
head on the ﬂagged pavement, and was killed on the spot.
I'raw we the curtain over consternation and bereavement,
and pass on to results. If a change' came over Laurence, it
was not for the better. He drank incessantly, became.

alternately moody and deﬁant, and added a coping-stone to
his offences by placing Sarah Mostyn at his table by the side
of his wife, and boldly avowing that her child was his child
also.
Then all the woman rose within Augusta, so long cowed and
dispirited. She left the table, and, the insult being repeated,
again retired in indignation.
Of the servants none had pitied her so much as Cicily, but
for whom communication with her friends had been cut oﬁ“.
Often had the former waxed savage over indignities she could
neither check nor prevent ; but in many little ways the faithful
domestic was enabled to ameliorate the condition of her mistress.
Now that Mrs. Aspinall—more lovely in her sad womanhood
than in her brilliant girlhood—was virtually supplanted, aprisoner
under torture in her husband’s house, with no tie of mother-
hood to bind her there, her old nurse, as the mouthpiece of
Mrs. Ashton and her aunt Chadwick, urged upon her once more
the necessity for legal separation, and she no longer turned a
deaf ear.
When Jabez came to hand over the next quarter’s dividends
Travis accompanied him, and then Augusta, in the presence of
both her executors, demanded and claimed her right to a legal
separation from her husband.
Laurence taken by surprise, started to his feet, then, resuning
his seat, said, with a soowl and a contemptuous sneer—
“You had better obtain a divorce, madam, whilst you are
about it. Mr. Clegg will not object to the cost, if you can only
be made Mrs. Clegg by Act of Parliament.
It was a cruel and uncalled-for sneer, and Travis, ﬁrirg up,
resented it for his friend, who appeared dumbfounded by the
suggestion.
“If she had been Mrs. Clegg, sir, instead of Mrs. As}inall,
there would have been no necessity now for the interference of
friends for her protection ! ”
“ Of course not,” sneered Aspinall. “ Mr. Clegg is thewhite
hen that never lays away ; and now, having favoured you with
one of Mrs. Ashton’s pithy proverbs, perhaps, gentlemer, you
will favour me by taking your departure; this house and this
lady are alike my property.”
The value he set upon the latter article of property was
testiﬁed by an immediate application of a horseavhip, so sayagely
applied that even Bob, and Luke the gardener, drawn t ither
by Augusta’s screams, wrenched the whip from him and

covered her escape, the latter declaring he would “ no longer
stay an’ witness sich wark.”
To this man, who was also gatekeeper, Cicily crept at night-
fall, and offered him a goodly sum down, out of her own savings,
promising a much larger one from Mrs. Aspinall, with the offer
of a new situation at Ardwick, if he would only suffer her ill-
used mistress to “get clear 0’ that brute’s violence.”
The man, to his credit be it told, refused the money, but
opened the gate; and, when Laurence wakened from his
sodden sleep at noon the next day, wife, cook, and gardener
were missing.
They three had walked to Ardwick, and once there, though
Augusta found sad havoc had been made in the place, all was
her own, carriage included, and the domestics in charge wel-
comed her with gladness.
> Without waiting for even the show of a breakfast, Augusta
hurried like a frightened bird to her mother’s nest in George
Street, where alone she felt secure.
Jabez and Travis were summoned, and when Aspinall, re-
covering frgm his stupor, sought his human property at Ard-
wick, he found the trustee under his father’s will—a Mr. Lillie
—holding the place for Augusta in right of his trust. And in
George Street he was refused admission, Mrs. Ashton justifying
her daughter’s ﬂight with “ self-preservation is the ﬁrst law of
nature. A good Jack makes a good Jill. It is the last straw
breaks the camel’s back. If you sow the wind, you must reap
thewhirlwind. He who beats his friend makes an enemy.”
He threatened, and she answered—
“Threatened folk live long. You had best, Mr. Aspinall,
keep your breath to cool your porridge. Augusta’s friends will
defend her from her only enemy. Pending separation you see
her no more.”
He never saw her more. The deed of separation was sealed
but never signed.
With Augusta, all good angels seemed to have flown from
Fallowﬁeld. In his demoniac passion, he strove to blacken her
character, to ﬁnd himself met with laughter—his own life had
been so chaste ! Whilst, as if to refute him, when she took
refuge with her mother, jabez deemed it a point of honour to
retreat. Accordingly he took up his temporary abode with
Travis, in delicacy towards her, and as a check upon himself.
N 0 act, or thought, or word of his must give an evil tongue a
chance to foul that spotless woman with its slime.

In the midst of all this, Aspinall’s embarrassments increased.
Creditors pressed; writs showered in upon him ,' Barret fore-
closed, and men were put in possession of the Grange. ' He
ﬂew to his old remedy, and it drove him mad. Lancaster
Gaol for debtors loomed upon him. From his chamber
window he beheld a sheriff’s ofﬁcer approach with a warrant.
His cavalry-pistols were in his dressing-room. A sharp report
rang through the house.- Laurence Aspinall, in the prime of
life, delirious with drink, driven to desperation by his own
proﬂigate excess, set a blood-red seal on the deed of separation.
51% -# it # ii %
Ten years had passed from the partnership of Ashton, Chad-
wick, and Clegg—years in which money well employed had
multiplied itself. Jabez was a rich man—a man of inﬂuence in
the town ,- no longer the amateur artist, but the patron of art, as
well Henry Liverseege and others could have told. As he had
been one of the ﬁrst promoters and directors of the Manchester
Mechanics’ Institution, so was he now the supporter of the
Royal Institution for the Advancement of Art ; and seeing
farther than Mr. Ashton, who, as a member of the New Quay
Navigation Company, ‘had opposed the Act for a railway
between Manchester and Liverpool, he threw his energy into
the project, and helped to carry it out, his cousin Travis
working with him.
His widowerhood had cast a gloom over him for a time, but
he left himself small leisure for morbid reﬂection, and that was
cheered by the prattle of his little Nelly. Then came the
crash at Fallowﬁeld, and when darkness set upon Aspinall and
his deeds, light broke upon the path of Jabez Clegg—at ﬁrst a
mere ray, but he worked the more cheerfully in its light. It
was not hape for himself; it was merely a joyful consciousness
that there was hope and calm in the sky over the head of their
ﬂuttering and wounded dove, and that Augusta could now rest
in peace with her mother in the house at Ardwick, with no
dread of a brutal husband bursting on them unawares.
He came and went as friend and executor, but it was long
before it ﬂashed across his comprehension that the fearful
ordeal through which Augusta had passed but brought his old
master’s daughter closer to him ; or that the prayer old Simon
had taught was being answered to the full. That which was
“above rubies” had blessed his life and kept his human heart
warm whilst his “ coast had enlarged 5 ” he had been kept from

The Manchester Man. 347
the evil of awilful and capricious wife ; and at last when he had
resigned all prospect of setting the puriﬁed pearl as a star on
his own breast, it dropped into his hand, unsought, unsolicited.
He had schooled his heart we know. He had married from
a sense of duty and grateful compassion. He was a faithful
husband to a true wife, and when he lost her he mourned her
as a valued friend. But though all the early love of his being
had been kept alive and in a ferment by the sufferings of
Augusta, as an honourable man he suffered no word or look to
betray more than a friend’s sympathy. And still he kept as
strong a guard over himself, though the tragic end of Laurence
had set her free once more.
That last fatal act struck a sensitive chord in Augusta’s
nature. There was no exultation at release. For a time she
lost sight of his proﬂigacy and cruelty, and accused herself of
having hastened the catastrophe by leaving him to his own
unbridled will and the temptress by his side. She wept for the
handsome lover who had captivated her young fancy ,' she
mourned for the besotted soul gone to its account with all its
imperfections rampant. '
“ Let her alone,” said Mrs. Ashton to her sister ; “ the
sharpest shower wears itself out soonest ; she will come to her
senses long before her crape is worn out.”
Mrs. Ashton was a true prophetess. For a long time the
Fallowﬁeld tragedy cast a shadow over the house at Ardwick,
and they led very retired lives. Then harp and piano were
heard once more, visitors were admitted, and the mansion that
Kezia and Cicily united in declaring “ worse than a nunnery,”
grew bright and cheerful, though the widow’s weeds were not
cast aside. (Kitty had been laid under the mould whilst
Augusta was yet a bride).
Almost two years had elapsed. Suitors in plenty had been
attracted by the wealthy young widow’s many charms, her old
admirer, Mr. Marsland, among the rest, yet Mrs. Aspinall
showed no disposition to change her state; and the one man
who had loved her longest and best was not of the number at
her feet. He scorned to importune now in his widowerhood for
the love withheld when they were both young. He counted age
by events, not years. a
It was for Augusta now, she who had been taught by her very
husband’s taunts and sneers to think upon the true man she
had set aside, to think of him daily and hourly with rapidly
strengthening attachment, and think of him as one who had

dropped her from the book of his life for ever. Her whole
thought was how could she become worthy the love ,of such a
man; yet every day and hour the fear pressed heavily upon her
that the quiet virtues of Ellen had driven her out of his heart
altogether. Of all her guests he was the one most welcome,
most desired, but he was the one she received with most reserve,
the one whose stay was briefest, whose visits fewest. “ Busi-
ness” appeared to have more imperative claims on him than
when he had his way to make ; and Augusta, whose sables had
long since been cast aside, seemed to wear them on her heart.
The vivacity which had never wholly forsaken her in all her
trials, forsook her now—she grew listless and melancholy.
Meanwhile Captain Richard Chadwick had come home on
half-pay to brighten up the somewhat dull house in George
Street, and comfort the old folk-to say nothing of astonishing
Sim and Nelly, with his long yarns and adventures. Sim
always spent part of his vacations with Mr. Clegg, who well
paid back to Bess all her early care of him. He indulged the
boy’s craving for books and pencils, ﬁrst implanted by himself
and in which he saw the dawn of his future career. That which
in his own case had been repressed and subordinated to trade
and money-making, should not be so checked in that boy ; and
old Simon, to whom the lad appeared a marvel, never ceased
to pride himself on his forecast in pronouncing jabez a “ God-
send.” I
It was during the second summer of her widowhood, when
Augusta accompanied her mother (not a whit the less stately
than of yore) to Carr Cottage- for the ﬁrst time since her
attempted elopement, that the feeling of all she had cast from
her, and all that she had brought upon herself, all that might
have been, and now never would be, pressed heaviest upon her.
She had gone thoughtfully over the old ground, had trod the
nettle-grown Lovers’ Walk, and sat down on the open window-
ledge at the stair-foot as once before, and wept tears of penitent
bitterness. How long she sat there she could not tell,- she was
weeping for a life lost and a love rejected. As once before,
the voice of Jabez (whom she imagined eighteen miles away)
broke upon her solitude, but now it thrilled through her,
There was a light touch upon her shoulder.
“ Mrs. Aspinall? ”
She shuddered.
_ “Oh ! don’t call me by that name—here t” broke from her,
imploringly.

“ What name shall I call you by?” half wonderingly ; then
in a lower semi-smothered tone of entreaty——-“ Augusta P ”
Lower sank her head in her hands ; but there was no
answer save her sobs. It was thus he had addressed her there
once before.
“ Augusta l”—-and this time the hand on her shoulder shook
-—“Augusta~dear Augusta, once on this very spot I found
you weeping thus, and I begged to be allowed to share your
grief. I told you I would give my life to serve you—what I
said then I repeat now—I would give my life to serve you, and
you knew it ! ” He gently drew one hand from her agitated
face. “ Tell me your trouble, as you would tell it to a
brother !”
A brother—ah, that was it! She drew her hand back, but
she did not rise, and her sobs seemed to choke her.
Again he took her hand, and his other arm went round her
soothingly, protectingly. “Oh, Augusta, this is inexpressibly
painful to me. I love you, as never man loved woman. Can
you not tell me what troubles you ? ” and the earnest tender-
ness of his voice made strange .music in her ears.
He had seated himself on the narrow window-ledge beside
her, and now he thought she was about to punish his presump-
tion and quit him haughtily as before.
But no ! She only slid from his arm to his very feet, and
cried, with still covered face—
“Oh, Jabez—dear Jabez, forgive me all I made you suffer
here ; for oh ! I have repented bitterly.”
He was stunned, bewildered. His passionate declaration of
love was made as a claim to her conﬁdence, not to her affection ;
and now—“ dearjabez ! ” Did he hear aright ? For an instant
he was silent from very incapacity to speak. Her bent head
touched his knees. . .
Slowly, reverently, as if she had been a saint, with every
nerve of his strong frame trembling with emotion, he raised her
from the ground ,' but no arm went round her now. He held
both her hands in his, and looked steadfastly down upon her;
but no answer made he to ‘her plea for pardon. Constraint in
voice and words was apparent and painful, but emotion grew too
strong for control.
“ Augusta, what is the meaning of this P For God’s sake do
not mislead me ! I seem on the threshold of heaven or mad-
ness. Is it possible that I, plain Jabez Clegg, can be ‘ dear ’
to you P ”

“ Dearer than life l”
Clear, full, and earnest came the words from her soul, clear
and truthful were the eyes that now sought his.
“ Thank God !”
He held her in his arms with a straining clasp, which told
how long they had quivered to embrace her so. His eyes lit
up with an intensity of love she knew not he could feel, and
never had his lips met woman’s in such fond kisses as he
pressed on hers.
The concentrated love of years seemed gathered to a focus
then. “ Life of my life l” he called her, and she knew and felt
it was so.
If the shade of the departed Ellen could have looked upon
them there, remembering how she had rushed to his embrace
in that very spot, and how different had been the kiss im-
printed on her wifely brow, would she have reproached him ?
I wis not.
Is it needful to add that, before the summer waned, the
Manchester Man, rapidly rising into public note and favour,
entered into another partnership ; or that Jabez Clegg, in right
of Augusta his wife, took possession of the mansion at Ardwick,
to the satisfaction of Mrs. Ashton, who said, “ Better late than
never !” Or to tell how the trade of Ashton, Chadwick, Clegg,
and Co. continued to extend P Or that Travis remained Co. to
the end of the chapter—the children’s Co, never taking a wife
unto himself? -

APPENDIX.
IN the foregoing story of the “ Manchester Man ” I have in a great
measure dealt with history, recorded and unrecorded, with absolute
people, events, and places. i ‘
I have not thought it advisable to break the narrative with cumbrous foot-
notes calculated to disturb the general reader; but I consider an eluci-
dating Appendix due alike to myself and to all those who, in perusing a
work of this kind, care to discriminate fact from ﬁction.
Little of the Manchester I have depicted remains intact, a whirlwind of
improvement (l) has swept over the town, but old inhabitants will, I think,
recognise the faithfulness of my descriptions, as they will remember many
of the persons who come and go incidentally throughout.
CHAP. I.—After writing this chapter, I learned that a cradled infant
was washed down the Irwell from the Broughton, not the Smedley and
Irk side, in the ﬂood of 1837. I was familiarwith the incident I relate
when I was quite a child myself, and I am now ﬁfty-three.
The two cases are therefore distinct, yet equally facts. In 1771,
during the ﬂoods which swept away Tyne Bridge, Newcastle, a vessel. took
up at sea a cradle in which was a child alive and well.
CHAP. III. (B)—The Rev. Joshua Brookes comes into my pages natu-
rally—no story of Manchester life at the commencement of this century
would be complete without him. I have endeavoured to do justice to a little-
understood man. Many of his eccentricities are on record. At my own
baptism and my mother’s churching, occurred the scene which I have
endeavoured to reproduce ; that delicate lady pushed and pulled about was
a stranger to my mother and sponsors. A characteristic anecdote, which I
have not met with in print, may not be out of place here.
A printer, of republican tendencies, named Cowdroy, took his son to
the font, and on the child’s name being required, answered “Citizen l"—
“ Citizen ?” growled Joshua, “that’s no name. I shall not give the child
a name like that l” “ I’ve a right to call my child what name I please,
and I dare you to baptise him otherwise,” boldly asserted Mr. Cowdroy.
“ Oh, you may call him Beelzebub if you like 1” testily responded the chap
lain, and Citizen the boy was accordingly baptized ; and the large sig'nboarrl
of C. Cowdroy, Printer, overlooked the Old Churchyard long after Joshu,~
Brookes was laid low in dust and ashes.

ii Appendix.
His odd friendship with old Mrs. Clowes is matter of fact. Similar
scenes to those I have described took place at funerals and weddings when
he ofﬁciated ; and his last contest with the Grammar School boys may be
found in Harland’s “ Collectanea.”
CHAPS. IV. and V. (C)—The little girl who made her way into the
presence of Prince William, sat on his knee and amused him and his suite
with details of toilettes in progress at home, to be rewarded with a plain
shilling, the required information, and a bow as the cortéqe passed down
Oldham Street, was Amelia Daniels, in after years my own mother. The
incident of the falling platform on Sale Moor is noted in history.
CHAP. VII.—Mrs. Clowes was as eccentric in her way as Parson
Brookes ; but beyond her dealings with the chaplain and school-boys, her
journey to Liverpool, her Sabbath dinners to the poor, and her attire,
“her place in this story belongs to the region of ﬁction. Her shop passed
to a relative, but the date of her death is unknown to the writer.
CHAPS. XVIII. and XIX—Peterloo is rapidly passing out of remem-
brance, and those who were not themselves eye-witnesses may accuse me
of exaggeration. To such I can only say that I have had my details from
actors or spectators. The house I have assigned to Mr. Chadwick in
Oldham Street, was occupied by my maternal grandfather, John Daniels,
and he was the paralysed old gentleman in charge of his servant Molly,
who, but for the timely interposition of a young man named T omlinson,
one of his own weavers, and Mr. Mabbott, would have been cut down.
His daughters, anxious for his safety, looking out for his return home from
the warehouse, saw from their open window more than I describe ; for one '
thing—a woman passed with her breast cut off; the two vaunting ofﬁcers
who reared their steeds against the house with threats, were a cousin and
a ﬁance ; the man who was shot down in Ancoats Lane, whilst bidding
his girls to retire, was, I believe, my grandfather’s tenant. The female
sabred on the hustings was a Mrs. Fildes when I knew her. Her son,
Henry Hunt Fildes, was in my father’s employ ; and either that same son,
or a grandson. is now an artist, not altogether unknown to the world.
From Miss Hindley I had nine years ago the story of her father’s fall. The
author of the satire on the yeomanry was my paternal grandfather, James
Varley, of Pendleton.
For the purpose of my narrative, I have antedated an occurrence in
the Theatre Royal. I was myself the little miss who cried out in alarm
that Edmund Kean was “ killing Mrs. McGibbon," but it was a few years
later. Mrs. Broadbent’s school occupied the next box to our party on
that occasion. I need scarcely add that I have drawn that lady, her
school-room, &c., from information and observation. The broken collar-
bone is not an invention.
CHAPS. XXIX. and XXX—The skating incident on Ardwick Green
Pond was an episode in the early life of the same John Daniels before-
named. Blindness followed his long immersion, and when all remedies
known in the last century failed, he regained his sight by swimming across
the Mersey, as related. I owe it to his memory to say that he must not
Otherwise be confounded with the man whom I have called Laurence
Aspinall.
CHAP. XXXII.——The Act for widening Market Street was obtained in
1821 ; but I ﬁnd that the ancient houses did not begin to “crumble into
dust ” until the following year.
CHAP. XXXVIII.—“ I’ll please my eye if I plague my heart,” with its

answer and consequences, formed the original base of this story; the wilful
girl and her handsome savage of a husband being in all respects but their
names realities. They were both in their graves before the period I
assign to their union. The Old Hall which witnessed so many outrages
and such sad catastrophes, may be found in the map of Hardwicke’s
History of Preston under its true name.
CHAR XLVI.-For much information respecting the fatal launch of
the Emma, I am indebted to the courtesy of the Secretary of the Bridge-
water Navigation Company, and also to Mrs. Abel Heywood, who has
.just presented to Manchester a statue of Oliver Cromwell, in the name
of her former husband, Mr. Goadsby, who had been Mayor of the city.
Mrs. Heywood was originally the Miss Grimes who christened the luckiess
ﬂat.
I cannot close this Appendix without acknowledging much kind assist-
ance from literary and and antiquarian friends in my researches. Of these
the late John Harland, Esq., antiquary and historian, the late Thomas-
Jones, Esq., librarian of Chetham Hospital, and the Rev. J. Finch Smith,
M. A., R.D., must be placed foremost.
